    Meeting: Mobile App Redesign Kickoff
    Date: January 15, 2024
    Participants: Alice (Product Manager), Bob (Tech Lead), Carol (UX Designer), David (Backend Engineer)
    
    Alice: Welcome everyone to the kickoff for our mobile app redesign project. This is a critical initiative for Q1.
    
    Bob: Thanks Alice. I've reviewed the technical requirements. We'll need to modernize our API infrastructure first.
    
    Carol: From a UX perspective, I suggest we start with user research. The current app has a 2.5 star rating mainly due to navigation issues.
    
    David: I agree with Bob. The backend API optimization should be our first priority. The current response times are 8-10 seconds.
    
    Alice: Let's set our goals. We need to:
    1. Improve app rating to 4+ stars
    2. Reduce API response time to under 2 seconds
    3. Complete the redesign by end of Q1
    
    Bob: I'll own the API optimization project. I can get it to under 2 seconds with caching and query optimization.
    
    Carol: I'll take responsibility for the UX redesign. I'll need 2 weeks for user research.
    
    David: I'll work with Bob on the backend improvements.
    
    Decisions made:
    - Approved $50K budget for the mobile app redesign project
    - API optimization is the first priority
    - UX research will run in parallel
    - Target completion is March 31, 2024
    
    Action items:
    - Bob will create the API optimization plan by Jan 20
    - Carol will complete user research by Jan 30
    - David will audit current API performance by Jan 18
    - Alice will schedule weekly progress meetings
