John: Good morning team. Let's do our standup.

Sarah: I'll go first. Yesterday I completed the user authentication feature. It's using OAuth2 as we discussed. Today I'm starting on the password reset functionality.

John: Great progress! Any blockers?

Sarah: No blockers, but I'll need the email service credentials to test the password reset emails.

Mike: I can help with that. I finished setting up the email service yesterday. I'll send you the credentials after this meeting.

John: Perfect. Mike, what about your tasks?

Mike: I've been working on the API rate limiting. It's about 70% done. We're using Redis for the rate limit counters. Should be complete by tomorrow.

Lisa: For the frontend, I've integrated Sarah's authentication API. The login flow is working smoothly. Today I'm adding the remember me functionality and improving the error messages.

John: Excellent! Any risks we should be aware of?

Mike: The Redis cluster might need scaling if we hit high traffic. I'll monitor it closely.

Sarah: Also, we should plan for a security review before going live with authentication.

John: Good points. I'll schedule a security review for next week. Let's keep pushing forward. Great work everyone!
