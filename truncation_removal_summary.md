# Truncation Removal Summary

## Overview

Successfully removed artificial data truncations throughout the Smart-Meet Lite codebase to allow the system to handle larger datasets without arbitrary limits.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Extractor Module** (`src/extractor.py`)

#### Decisions and Action Items (Lines 510-511)
- **Before**: Limited to 5 decisions and 5 action items
- **After**: Returns all extracted decisions and action items
- **Impact**: Meetings with many decisions/action items are now fully captured

```python
# Changed from:
decisions=decisions[:5],
action_items=action_items[:5],

# To:
decisions=decisions,  # Return all decisions
action_items=action_items,  # Return all action items
```

### 2. **Query Engine Module** (`src/query_engine.py`)

#### Timeline Confidence Calculation (Line 517)
- **Before**: Confidence calculated from only first 5 timeline events
- **After**: Confidence calculated from all timeline events
- **Impact**: More accurate confidence scores for timeline queries

```python
# Changed from:
confidence = sum(e['confidence'] for e in timeline_data[:5]) / min(5, len(timeline_data))

# To:
confidence = sum(e['confidence'] for e in timeline_data) / len(timeline_data)
```

#### Relationship Display (Lines 590-591, 620)
- **Before**: Limited to 10 relationships for display and confidence calculation
- **After**: Processes all relationships
- **Impact**: Complete relationship data in queries

```python
# Changed from:
high_confidence = [r for r in relationship_data[:10] if r['confidence'] > 0.8]
medium_confidence = [r for r in relationship_data[:10] if 0.6 < r['confidence'] <= 0.8]
shown_relationships = relationship_data[:10]

# To:
high_confidence = [r for r in relationship_data if r['confidence'] > 0.8]
medium_confidence = [r for r in relationship_data if 0.6 < r['confidence'] <= 0.8]
shown_relationships = relationship_data
```

#### Timeline Display Configuration (Line 492)
- **Before**: Hard-coded to show 5 timeline events
- **After**: Configurable via `settings.timeline_display_limit`
- **Impact**: Flexible timeline display based on user needs

```python
# Changed from:
for event in timeline_data[:5]:

# To:
for event in timeline_data[:settings.timeline_display_limit]:
```

### 3. **Entity Resolver Module** (`src/entity_resolver.py`)

#### Entity Description Keywords (Line 255)
- **Before**: Limited to 50 characters
- **After**: Extended to 200 characters
- **Impact**: Better entity resolution with more context

```python
# Changed from:
catalog_entry['keywords'].append(entity.attributes['description'][:50])

# To:
catalog_entry['keywords'].append(entity.attributes['description'][:200])
```

### 4. **Configuration Module** (`src/config.py`)

#### New Setting Added
```python
# Query Engine
timeline_display_limit: int = 5  # Number of timeline events to show in query results
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Capture**: No artificial limits on meeting decisions or action items
2. **Accurate Analytics**: Confidence scores based on all available data
3. **Flexible Display**: Configurable limits for UI presentation
4. **Better Entity Resolution**: More context for entity matching

## Testing

Created `test_truncation_removal.py` to verify:
- Extraction of >5 decisions and action items
- Display of >10 relationships
- Configurable timeline limits
- Extended entity description handling

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch query times with larger datasets
2. **Add Pagination**: For very large result sets in API responses
3. **User Configuration**: Allow users to set their own display limits
4. **Documentation**: Update API docs to reflect unlimited data handling

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive tests when API is available
2. Consider adding pagination for large result sets
3. Add more configurable limits to settings
4. Update API documentation
