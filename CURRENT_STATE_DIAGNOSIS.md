# Current State Diagnosis - Smart-Meet Lite
**Date**: 2025-01-07 21:05
**API Status**: Running on http://localhost:8000

## System Health
- ✅ API is running and healthy
- ✅ Database: 11 entities, 23 memories, 3 meetings
- ✅ Vector DB: 650 points in Qdrant
- ✅ LLM connectivity: Working with openai/gpt-4o-mini

## Phase 1: String Formatting Fix - STATUS: ✅ WORKING
- **Test Result**: Queries with % characters no longer crash
- **Evidence**: Successfully queried "50% Milestone Project" - HTTP 200
- **Issue**: The entity "50% Milestone Project" is not being extracted (separate issue)

## Phase 2: State Normalization - STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Database Level**: ✅ States are normalized in storage (in_progress)
- **Issues Found**:
  1. Entity extraction not creating all entities from transcripts
  2. Relationship warnings still appearing in logs
  3. Test showed 0 entities extracted from transcript

## Current Critical Issues

### 1. Entity Extraction Failure
- **Problem**: Entities mentioned in transcripts are NOT being extracted
- **Evidence**: Ingested transcript with "50% Milestone Project", "Project Alpha", "Project Beta" but got 0 entities
- **Impact**: Queries can't find entities that don't exist

### 2. Relationship Type Validation
- **Problem**: LLM returning invalid relationship types ("needs", "related", "blocked")
- **Evidence**: WARNING logs show relationship validation failures
- **Solution Prepared**: relationship_normalizer.py created but not integrated

### 3. Query Engine Issues
- **Problem**: Queries return generic "no data" responses even when data exists
- **Evidence**: "50% Milestone Project" query returns "status unknown" despite ingestion

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue appears to be in the extraction pipeline:
1. Transcripts are ingested successfully
2. But entities are NOT being extracted from the transcript
3. Without entities, the query engine has nothing to query

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Debug Entity Extraction**:
   - Check if extractor.py is being called
   - Verify LLM is returning entities
   - Check entity processing in processor_v2.py

2. **Complete Relationship Normalizer Integration**:
   - Update storage.py save_relationships method
   - Add normalization before saving

3. **Fix Entity Resolution**:
   - Entities that aren't extracted can't be found by queries
   - Need to ensure extraction is working first

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Fix entity extraction issue (this blocks everything else)
2. Complete relationship normalizer integration
3. Then proceed with Phase 3 (Entity stop word filtering)
4. Continue with remaining phases

## Test Commands for Verification

```bash
# Test entity extraction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transcript": "Alice: Project XYZ is starting tomorrow.",
    "title": "Test Meeting"
  }'

# Check if entity was created
curl http://localhost:8000/api/entities | grep XYZ

# Test query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is Project XYZ?"}'
```
