# 012: Current Progress and Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary: Current State (July 2, 2025)

### What's Actually Working
1. **Database Performance**: Indexes added, batch operations implemented ‚úì
2. **Cache Layer**: Created and functional with TTL support ‚úì
3. **LLM Processor**: Batch comparison with model fallback implemented ‚úì
4. **Basic Ingestion**: Entities and memories are created successfully ‚úì

### What's Broken
1. **State Tracking**: Async issues prevent batch LLM comparison from running
2. **Query Engine**: Calling non-existent methods (get_entity_transitions ‚Üí get_entity_timeline)
3. **Entity Resolution**: Using tool calls that free model doesn't support
4. **SSL/Network**: Connection errors to OpenRouter API

### Critical Findings
- The free OpenRouter model (`cypher-alpha:free`) doesn't support function/tool calling
- Entity resolver bypasses our resilient LLMProcessor architecture
- Query engine v2 has method name mismatches with storage layer
- Nested asyncio.run() causes runtime errors in FastAPI context

## Detailed Task Completion Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Phase 1.1: Database Performance
- Added critical `idx_memories_meeting_id` index
- Implemented `save_entities_batch()` with intelligent upsert logic
- Implemented `save_transitions_batch()` for bulk insertion
- Implemented `get_entities_batch()` and `get_states_batch()`
- **Impact**: Query performance improved from 135+ seconds to sub-second potential

#### Phase 1.2: Core Infrastructure
- Created `CacheLayer` with TTL support and statistics
- Created `LLMProcessor` with 4-model fallback chain
- Implemented batch state comparison (reduces n API calls to 1)
- **Impact**: API costs reduced by ~95% when operational

#### Phase 2.2: Code Cleanup
- Removed dead code processing `extraction.states`
- Removed obsolete `_detect_semantic_changes` method
- Updated imports and fixed method signatures

### ‚ùå Failed/Blocked Tasks

#### Phase 2.1: Batch LLM Integration
- **Status**: Implemented but broken due to async issues
- **Problem**: `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`
- **Impact**: Falls back to simple comparison, missing semantic understanding

#### Phase 4: Testing
- **Status**: Partially successful
- **LLM Batch Test**: Works in isolation, correctly identifies semantic equivalence
- **API Test**: Fails due to query engine issues
- **Cache Test**: Works (50% hit rate demonstrated)

### üöß In Progress Tasks

#### Fix Entity Resolver (Critical)
- **Problem**: Uses tool_choice with model that doesn't support it
- **Solution Applied**: Converted to regular JSON response format
- **Remaining**: Test the fix

#### Fix Query Engine Methods
- **Problem**: Calls `storage.get_entity_transitions()` which doesn't exist
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Replaced with `storage.get_entity_timeline()`
  - Implemented missing `storage.search_memories()`
- **Remaining**: Test the fixes

## Ultra-Comprehensive Implementation Plan

### IMMEDIATE PHASE (Next 2 Hours): Get Back to Baseline

#### 1. Fix Async Event Loop Issue (30 minutes)
**Problem**: FastAPI runs in event loop, can't nest asyncio.run()

**Solution A - Quick Fix**:
```python
# In processor_v2.py, detect if we're in an event loop
import asyncio

def process_meeting_with_context(self, extraction, meeting_id):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Check if we're already in an event loop
    try:
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        # We're in an async context, create task instead
        task = loop.create_task(self._create_comprehensive_transitions(...))
        transitions = loop.run_until_complete(task)
    except RuntimeError:
        # No event loop, safe to use asyncio.run()
        transitions = asyncio.run(self._create_comprehensive_transitions(...))
```

**Solution B - Proper Fix**:
Make the entire chain async:
- `process_meeting_with_context` ‚Üí `async def process_meeting_with_context`
- Update API endpoint to await it
- Remove asyncio.run() completely

#### 2. Test Entity Resolution Fix (15 minutes)
- Start API
- Run test ingestion
- Verify no more 400 errors on entity resolution
- Check logs for successful JSON parsing

#### 3. Test Query Engine Fix (15 minutes)
- Run all 4 test queries
- Verify timeline queries work
- Verify search queries work
- Check for proper state transition retrieval

#### 4. Fix Model Configuration (30 minutes)
**Problem**: Free model specified in .env doesn't work well

**Solution**:
```python
# In settings.py or .env
OPENROUTER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307  # Reliable, supports our needs
OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS=openai/gpt-3.5-turbo,mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct
```

Update all components to use model that works with our requirements.

#### 5. Verify State Tracking (30 minutes)
- Ingest meeting 1 with initial states
- Ingest meeting 2 with state changes
- Query for transitions
- Verify semantic changes are detected

### SHORT-TERM PHASE (Next Day): Production Readiness

#### 1. Complete Async Overhaul (2 hours)
- Convert all processor methods to async
- Update storage methods to async where beneficial
- Use asyncio.gather() for parallel operations

```python
class SmartMeetError(Exception):
    """Base exception for Smart-Meet"""
    pass

class LLMError(SmartMeetError):

    pass

class StorageError(SmartMeetError):
    """Storage-related errors"""
    pass

# Wrap all API endpoints with proper error handling
@app.exception_handler(SmartMeetError)
async def smart_meet_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content={"error": str(exc), "type": exc.__class__.__name__}
    )
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Implement Immediately)
```python
# test_storage.py
def test_batch_operations():
    storage = MemoryStorage()
    entities = [Entity(...) for _ in range(100)]
    
    start = time.time()
    saved_ids = storage.save_entities_batch(entities)
    duration = time.time() - start
    
    assert len(saved_ids) == 100
    assert duration < 1.0  # Should be fast

# test_llm_processor.py
def test_fallback_chain():
    processor = LLMProcessor(cache)
    # Mock first model to fail
    # Assert second model is tried
    # Assert result is cached
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# test_full_pipeline.py
async def test_state_tracking_pipeline():
    # Ingest meeting with initial states
    response1 = await client.post("/api/ingest", json=meeting1)
    assert response1.status_code == 200
    
    # Ingest meeting with state changes
    response2 = await client.post("/api/ingest", json=meeting2)
    assert response2.status_code == 200
    
    # Query for changes
    query = await client.post("/api/query", json={
        "query": "What changed for Project Alpha?"
    })
    assert "progress" in query.json()["answer"]
```

### Performance Tests
```python
# test_performance.py
def test_query_performance():
    # Create 1000 entities with states
    # Run various queries
    # Assert all complete in < 1 second
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **LLM Dependency**: Implement local model fallback
2. **Data Loss**: Automated backups, transaction logs
3. **Security**: API authentication, input validation
4. **Scale**: Performance testing, capacity planning

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
2. **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Function with reduced capability
4. **Monitoring Alerts**: Proactive issue detection
