Meeting SummaryDate: June 2, 2025
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Planning & Alignment

*Summary:*

   - Overall timelines for UAT testing of in-scope applications have been
   established.
   - Baseline test cases for all applications are ready.
   - Super users for each application have been identified.
   - Plan to schedule review calls:
      - Function-specific calls for super users to ensure alignment with
      UAT timelines, test cases, and access provisioning.
      - Manufacturing applications will have a joint call with
      manufacturing super users; similar approach for other functions.
   - Target for super user review calls: end of June 2025.
   - All architecture and design activities are complete except ongoing
   design reviews for Web Broker and Taller (target completion: within a we=
ek).
   - Builds are already in progress for most applications, and the project
   is on track with proposed timelines.

*Key Points:*

   - Anything highlighted in yellow on the slide indicates pending
   reconfirmation with respective function leads.
   - For =E2=80=9CBuy Value AP 900=E2=80=9D application, timelines are base=
d on current
   estimations=E2=80=94calls set up to discuss these with business leaders =
next week
   (week of June 9, 2025).
   - Weekly calls to be scheduled with business teams to ensure ongoing
   alignment and prevent surprises due to tight schedules.

------------------------------
2. Workstream and Organizational Alignment

*Summary:*

   - Applications currently span at least five main workstreams:
      - ERP, IMA (analytics), CCEX (customer experience), business-managed
      applications, and IT-managed ISC (Integrated Supply Chain) applicatio=
ns.
   - Concern raised about business users receiving multiple overlapping
   UAT/testing requests from different workstreams, creating confusion.
   - Proposal to consolidate plans from all workstreams into a single,
   common plan for business leaders.
   - Current activity to set up a SharePoint site and develop a dashboard
   for visibility on testing overlaps, resource allocations, and escalation
   points.
      - A meeting to review this is proposed for Wednesday afternoon or
      Thursday morning (June 4=E2=80=935, 2025).

*Key Points:*

   - Importance of integrated communication and status tracking across
   workstreams stressed by multiple attendees.
   - Goal: Improve visibility and reduce redundant efforts or conflicting
   asks on business teams.
   - Efforts in place to accumulate and aggregate status for all
   ISC-applicable applications across workstreams.

------------------------------
3. SSO (Single Sign-On) Strategy

*Summary:*

   - Ongoing discussions on SSO implementation for Day 1 (August 1, 2025,
   targeted go-live):
      - Identification of application impacts and use cases continues, with
      meetings set up between application teams and the SSO team.
      - Testing strategy is being clarified, especially regarding QA/lower
      environments versus production.
   - Applications notably impacted by SSO in Day 1: Taller UI, Sparta, Web
   Broker, Toller Portal.
   - Some technical SSO concerns:
      - Handling of HID (Honeywell ID) to SID (SpinCo ID) transitions in
      credentials and reporting.
      - Ensuring clarity on SSO credential use in re-imaged laptops for
      Solstice entity users (users will use a single, re-imaged laptop, wit=
h
      credentials for Solstice apps and existing Honeywell credentials for
      applications still on the Honeywell tenant).

*Key Points:*

   - Laptops to be re-imaged and distributed to users prior to Day 1.
   - Some processes and access scenarios are only confirmed verbally at
   this stage=E2=80=94more solidification required through QA testing and o=
ngoing SSO
   team coordination.
   - Special challenge in Toller Portal due to storage of IDs/passwords and
   existence of external users; a separate session scheduled.

------------------------------
4. Infrastructure Migration and Ownership (Team Guru, ECAT, and Scheduling
Tools)

*Summary:*

   - Progress on Team Guru and ECAT applications is positive.
   - Vendor POs are in place, with extraction activity planned for this
   week (first week of June 2025).
   - A compliance-driven migration:
      - Decision to move UI Scheduling Tool to on-premises due to CGMP
      compliance, necessitating another server/domain migration
(global Honeywell
      domain to SpinCo in September/October 2025).
   - Open question regarding long-term application/service owner roles for
   new on-prem servers=E2=80=94possible initial assignment to Benny or to f=
ield-based
   personnel (e.g., Jatinder for on-site support).
   - Integration points noted with Documentum, LIMS, and SATC.

*Risks Identified:*

   - Network and firewall changes for large site cutovers (MER, Baton
   Rouge, etc.) scheduled for September=E2=80=93October, which is close to =
go-live.
   - This creates risk in completing UAT and QA testing ahead of the
   October go-live for on-prem applications.

------------------------------
5. Toller Portal, TMC, and BDS Application Updates

*Summary:*

   - Toller Portal: Test case design and business pocket ready; next steps
   are focused on testing.
   - TMC and BDS: Build starts this week or next; design documents ready.
   - Toller Portal migration kickoff planned for next week.
   - For BDS, a cost increase (previously $23,900, now up by $3,000 to
   $27,700) will be handled via a change request (CR) and updated purchase
   order (PO).
   - Support contract for the Toller Portal under review; post=E2=80=93Oct =
27,
   2025, a separate support contract will be needed=E2=80=94conversations o=
ngoing with
   vendors and suppliers.

*Key Points:*

   - Production support and contract/licensing discussions underway, aiming
   for clarity early next month (July 2025).
   - Need to kickoff work with BDS and TFC has been emphasized.

------------------------------
6. Trade Compliance & Ownership Changes

*Summary:*

   - Recent change: Sashi has left a key role; Nitin Kulkarni is the new
   point of contact for trade-related applications.
   - Some outstanding issues referenced, but minimal current details
   provided; more follow-up expected.

=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Pramod0:00
It and yeah we my plan is to because now we have some sort of timelines on
the testing the UAT testing for the applications that are in scope and we
do have the test cases as well the baseline test cases for all the
applications and we already figured out the super users for each of the
applications. So since you know we have we have the alignment in all the
three cases. I'll probably schedule a call with the super users to review
the test cases. Probably one manufacturing call for all the manufacturing
applications with the manufacturing super users. Likewise we can do that
for all other functions as well to make sure the super users are aligned
with the UAT timeline, they're aligned with the test cases, they align with
the accesses and from that now we can take it forward to do the testing.
I'll probably now said something maybe the end of June or something like
that and probably we don't need to talk more about this. It's a useful
slide. If you have any questions you can reach me out. And yeah this is
where we are with regards to the timeline. We are done with the design for
all the architecture, the design and everything is completed. The only part
is some design review is in progress with a couple of applications web
broker taller and we are targeting to complete in a week or so but the
build is already in progress for most of the applications at least the
discussions and stuff like that and you know we will be able to march
towards the timeline. Whatever I have given here. Yeah this is the usual
slide with the partnership between the IT sorry the entity honeybal versus
the third party vendor. So you know we are just using the slide as a
reference for that. So here is the plan we have Wherever you see as yellow
highlighted we still need to reconfirm this with the respective function
leads but anything without the yellow highlighted those are aligned with
the functional leads and they would be able to. You know we will be able to
complete the UATN test on time as per the timelines that I have updated
here. So the only thing is for the buy value of AP 900 I have given the
timeline based on my thought process. I created some high level scheduled
and I reviewed that with Rahul and Nare Daniel. I schedule a call next week
with with the business and it it's basically a call to portray about the
the timelines for completing the ABS of functionality, the Capslon
functionality and also you know when we are going to engage people to do
the testing right and also we can utilize the call to do some sort of
solution walkthrough because Anyway, we are going to, you know, it's going
to be the same functionality in brdbrd but we have to make the
customization on top of it to make it work for aim and we will showcase on,
you know, what is the way to move forward, how we are going to approach the
solution. Something like that. Okay. I set up a call on that. So it's
daily, not a call Daniel or someone from sourcing organization. No. Daniel,
you there?
Neil3:58
Yep.
Pramod4:00
Okay. Okay. So yeah, so probably now you can also forward the team right.
To other people who need to participate in that call. It's basically a
timeline conversation plus the business engagement plus the solution
walkthrough and once that is done and the expectation is set because during
that call Maybe the functional COEs and the IT organization may have some
open questions about you know, the vendor mapping, stuff like that.
Probably can answer that. And then once that is solidified, then we will go
with the solution build process and everything. I'm going to schedule a
call on a regular basis to touch base with the business to make sure if
both are aligned because as long as we have that kind of close
coordination. Right. There won't be any surprises during the UA3 because of
the aggressive timelines. Right. So I'm going to schedule the call on a
weekly basis as well just to make sure if you're all aligned.
Jaime5:00
Sounds good.
Pramod5:01
All right, thank you. No problem. You can also follow that in my trollers.
Okay. Yeah. Whatever you see here, some of the things, you know we are not
going to do any testing because those are going to spin with site. There
are no opportunity to do the testing. It should ideally work. Some of the
applications are SaaS as I explained before, it's having a separate
credentials and of course if it is working today and it should work
tomorrow and wherever I have highlighted in the amber color like with
broker ebay student that's where we have to put more stress on to do the
testing during day one. Yeah, so of course there are a few changes going
on. The core changes that are currently happening on the bit broker, some
of the things on the toilet, some of the other changes on the bot. Of
course you know I value of CE8900 and SAPGTs is more of user access control
in place. But you know we are working with, I mean Jeff is from the
functional COE of IT side is working with the business to identify the user
list for GTS and EAP and those kind of conversation is going on. Okay, any,
any questions from anyone on this? And Neil, I think we spoke on this last
Friday. Yeah, you me and promote it. Just. I'm just, you know, keeping it
as in progress slide. Maybe you can assign someone from your team who can
probably pull the status on the business managed or any ISE impacted
applications that we are not taking care under the IEC IEP inventory. We
can also put together something here.
Neil6:52
Yeah, yeah. Last week though, we discussed that, Jaime, didn't we?
Pramod6:57
Yeah. Correct. Correct. You have any questions, probably you can use this
meeting to talk about that. If hi Ma is there on the call or others that
are on the call, you can probably keep some alignment.
Neil7:09
Is he invited to this call? I don't see. He's not on the call. But is he
invited?
Pramod7:14
Hi Mom.
Stephen7:15
Yeah, yeah, he is invited.
Kunal7:17
Yeah.
Stephen7:17
He must have conflict.
Neil7:19
Yeah.
Stephen7:19
I think he's the right person for this.
Neil7:21
I have easy. But sure. I think one of the quick and easy answers is. I
don't. If you can flip back. I don't see any of this DX applications. CX
your customer service.
Pramod7:41
No, this is.
Stephen7:43
Yeah, this is what you see.
Neil7:44
So CX is part of a. Yeah, understood. But at a minimum.
Stephen7:50
Right.
Neil7:52
CX applications are most certainly of interest and in fact we actually
manage that transition. So you know, let's. We can accumulate a list, but
let's start with their stuff particularly I'm worried about like EDI
transitions, everything around web portal. Those will all be important.
Pramod8:17
Ecom will be what I'm talking about.
Neil8:19
Yeah.
Pramod8:19
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Promote8:23
Yeah. This is. This is where me will play myself connected and threading.
And what I proposed is there is a different view of how isc when I'm saying
isc, the business ISC looks into it. Business ISC probably has three
separate set of applications. One, the one that is managed by IT ioc, which
is what you see on the screen. Two, the business manager applications which
Steve Dellard is managing partnering with Yaritza. And three, the
applications which for IEC like the CS applications where we need to
probably go to the other work streams like CS as a work stream from the IT
standpoint and then understand what is the disposition or what is the
status on those applications. And that's where I need someone like either
you or me to really coordinate that efforts. I'm happy to schedule a call
with hima and then hyma 10th of guidelines. But then I see someone like you
are really those different work streams.
Stephen9:38
Hey, so last week just follow up from that Friday discussion. So this is.
We're only seeing 1/4 of the slice of the IT applications that's affecting
ISC Steve. Stephen and there is, to Pramod's point, and what I gathered was
there is an ERP work stream, there is an IMA work stream, which is more
analytics and then there's a CCEX work stream. And now in this call, I
heard there was another one with Steve Delat with business Managed
Application. So there are at least five. And there is. That's why I was
asking Pierce and Paul Offline in an email that can bring the five work
streams into a common plan that the business leaders can actually see. The
folks that are impacted and the people we call for UAT and testing are
getting pinged by multiple folks across work streams. And so we just want
to express the proper plan across these work streams so that the business
teams are informed and then take some Q and A. And that was an aspect that
Pierce, I had for you. We can connect on that offline, but I think that's
my request.
Jaime10:55
Yeah, and we're actually working on that right now. There is a SharePoint
that we've set up and then there will be a dashboard that all the different
groups have access to to where we can actually see where some of the
testing is coinciding with another function and then we can see who's
behind or what escalations there are. So that's going to be reviewed. I'll
set up a meeting for us. It'll probably be Wednesday afternoon or Thursday
morning, but we're working on that right now. And that should help align
the different business units.
Stephen11:24
Okay, thank you. It's very much needed. I mean, I've got things from
multiple LoB members across the AIs and SND teams where they're asking why
are we getting all these requests from multiple people? I want to support,
but I don't. I want to see a larger plan first. And so that's why I was
asking you for help.
Pramod11:49
Yeah, I have also updated from my end on whatever that we know from ISC
side. You were asking some contacts, Ima.
Stephen11:58
Yeah, I got it, I got it.
Pramod12:00
Okay, no problem. So once we have, you know, some sort of plan in place and
once we have some shape, you know, we can start accumulating all that this
here. Right. Probably we can talk about it. I think Srinam, you have to see
the similar kind of call on the ERP side as well. You rightly said that,
you know, we need some common call wherever you see any impact on the ISC
applications with regards to any other work streams. It could be IMA or it
could be CCX or ISE or erp, blah blah. So you need some common forum to
discuss all of that, right?
Neil12:34
Yeah.
Stephen12:35
Each work stream is doing a really good job working within their silo,
which is fantastic. I think that's good. We want to see the larger plan and
ensure that our stakeholders are communicated correctly, that this is how
we're managing this overall project. I think the activity is happening.
There's a communication that we can close out on.
Pramod12:55
Sure. So any help needed from IFE site, please let us know.
Neil12:59
Yeah, yeah.
Pramod13:00
Problem. So yeah, I think we spoke about the SSO approach last week. I
think we've been talking about this in all of our calls, internal calls.
There are a few things happening like in terms of at least we know
understood about the high level approach on what's going to happen during
day one versus day two. So now the application team is working on
identifying the use cases. Wherever they see any impact on their
application, they are just going over those things and working with the SSO
team to understand some clarity on that. Right. Because the first and
foremost question is they have given all these guidelines from the fraud
production system standpoint. Okay, then how are we going to do this
testing in the QA environment, the lower end when it is a question. So now
the team is, you know, kind of identifying the test cases and also, you
know, setting up a meeting with the SO team to understand more clarity on
this before we get into the product development. Right. So these are the
applications that I have put here, like Taller ui, Sparta, Web Broker.
Those are the only applications that are going to get impacted during day
one. So that's where in our functionalities from IT side they are having
conversations with the team on that. So there are no questions here.
Probably we can move on to the next slide. So these are some of the use
cases that I was mentioned about before. Right. These are the very general
use cases as of today that came into our mind. But this is what you know,
they have to further drill down more and understand with regards to each of
the application and then they need to do the testing before we get into
production.
Neil14:47
Yeah.
Pramod14:48
So one of the important thing is, you know, if there were any role assigned
to the HID to access so the HID to be changed based ID or if there are any
reports that are currently working through a hid, should that be changed to
sid? So these are the generic things but we have to keep this more specific
to the application wise with regards to toll or EY or web broker, how this
is going to get impacted. Right. So yeah, so that's the thing going on for
sso. Yeah, let's get into the function wise status.
Stephen15:24
A quick question Gokul. So after this. This is a. After the spin or after
8:1 I'm imagining right Is are people going to have access to both systems
when they log in differently to each entity like the Honeywell and the
solstice entities to login two username passwords.
Pramod15:46
No, no, no. You are talking about each one that's going to be 2710. Each
one is only the softest pin. 2710 is what we are targeting the full day one
so they will be issued laptop the reimagined laptop with the solicitors
credential and any applications that are physically separated from day one.
Right. Any move assets are build back that are going to go with day one
client for those applications they would be accessed through the SSO atance
server and SSO credentials But any applications that are going to stick
with the Honeywell if those are a PSA during day one those are only
logically separated for those applications they can still be able to use
the existing Honeywell credentials and it works through the Honeywell sso.
Stephen16:38
So in their reimaged laptop they can log in through the Honeywell
credentials Only one.
Pramod16:46
It's not two laptops, it's going to be one. Yes. They don't need to log off
anything. They will be prompted with the credential if they have to access
any honeymoon application Same as how we answer Amazon. Okay, but.
Stephen17:00
But they're gonna get the laptops before 8:1 or after 8:1.
Pramod17:05
That's what I know. I think we have to check that with the ski dell. After.
It'll be after.
Neil17:12
Okay.
Pramod17:13
After innocent they need date. Oh yeah, day one. No, it'd be before day one=
.
Jaime17:17
Sorry.
Pramod17:26
Yes. Yeah.
Neil17:27
Yes.
Pramod17:28
Okay, thank you. So. So Steven, that's what we are. Because all these are a
verbal understanding, right? We need to solidify this. We need to do some
testing. That's what the application owners and the functional leads are
currently coordinating with the SS14 how this is going to play out. Yeah,
thank you.
Srinam17:54
Yeah, I'm there.
Pramod17:56
So.
Srinam17:57
Hi everyone. So we are progressing okay on all the applications on the team
guru as well as on the ecat. We have a line of sight and we have started
progressing in that direction as well as in the ecat. We already have a PO
with the vendor and extract extraction activity we have planned this week.
One point I would like to highlight which is mentioned in the this column
is we have what decision that we will move to the on prem version for the
UI scheduling Tool from the Azure because of the CGMP compliance and based
on that what has happened now today we have a global domain within
Honeyware only where we are going to move the servers so there will be one
more migration which will be happening from the global domain to spinco
domain in the month of September October time frame which was something
which we discovered last week Just want to share that would like to
understand how much we will need to involve vendor in this whole process
and whenever we are ordering new servers right now we need to decide a path
who can be the server owner Today server owner is the service owner right
now which is within Honeywell but whenever we are ordering new server for
the application which will be on prem need to understand who can be that
service server owner so need some guidance in that area we do have
integration with the Documentum limbs and SATC where we are connecting to
them and the XSOPs Google has taken at length what are the different
questions or queries we people have and we are trying to set up a call with
SSO team and get that clarified.
Neil20:00
That's all from my side.
Pramod20:02
Yeah.
Neil20:02
Any questions?
Pramod20:03
Yeah yeah maybe you know we can ask is there anyone who can help us out on
what's going to be the plan for the new application owner or service owner
for Athens So I.
Promote20:13
Can give a guidance there? Yes, I mean I will confirm that but then my
thought is we will put Benny's name to start with. I know Benny is in
process of hiring the the managers or team members for each different
function that we have like one for manufacturing, one for planning, one for
logistics and all that.
Pramod20:36
Okay.
Promote20:36
To start with I will. I will probably get Benny's name. I will confirm that
field based server.
Pramod20:43
Owners are probably going to end up being somebody in James Solomon's group
because he owns infrastructure.
Promote20:50
Yeah but he owns a CO and he owns a colo. Yeah, that's. That's not how we.
We own it. Correct. Here the here everything is owned by service owners not
the infra team.
Pramod21:02
Yeah that's exact puzzle that we need to.
Promote21:04
That's the exact puzzle.
Pramod21:09
I think Prasanna you can EVOE is the only area where we need the local
server. Right. So maybe we can reach out James Solomon as you mentioned
promote. We can also copy Benny if it is.
Promote21:25
If it is case of ey. I thought in case of EY we already have a service
existing service which.
Srinam21:30
We are using no, we created new ones promote but we do have an
infrastructure person on site his name is Jatinder. Clear Ms. My proposal
will be if he's a server owner, he will be the person going to take care in
future also. But we need to understand and agree on that approach.
Pramod21:53
Okay. Yeah. I think what we see here is everything is going in the right
direction. The only area is there are few questions on the yes approach on
how this is going to work. During day one we need to do some QA testing,
low level environment testing. Then EY is going to deploy the things not on
the cloud and on the on prem which is on the local sales or server. And we
we are getting from you know the site cut over the DCN team that they are
taking Muskegon as a pilot that they are going to start the work from July.
But for the rest of the larger sites like any case MER or Baton Rouge and
stuff like that, I think they are going to take the during September time
frame which means that all the network change, the firewall change, the
domain change for the site specific cutover will happen only during
September October time frame. If that is the case, how do we ensure that
you know the testing and stuff like that, you know during our qa, you know
the UAT testing I'm talking about. Right. Because we are targeting the go
live itself by October. If they themselves, you know take their time to
complete the cutover during September October, then how do we ensure to do
the testing before that question. So that is still a risk I think. Pramod,
we talked about it in our internal call today. Right. We need to keep some
plans ready.
Promote23:34
Yep, I agree.
Pramod23:36
So that that is a risk anywhere. You know we are talking about on prem
applications and hosting. Yeah, that's. That's going to be the risk. Yeah.
Okay, good. Thank you pr. Yeah thank you. And anyone from logistics, Shilpa
or.
Kunal23:56
So SSO thing we already discussed about and there is a special case in case
of Toller Portal SSO where we are storing the Honeywell IDs and password
and Toler portal and there are external users also. So there is all
schedule to discuss on the approach that one part. Regarding the toller
portal we got the test case design and business pocket. The next we'll be
doing testing part. So we are cover on that part. Regarding the TMC and BDS
the buildover will start this week this probably next week and design
documents are ready for toller PMC and PDS and then next next week plan is
to open a toler portal migration.
Pramod24:45
Yeah, I think the only important thing is I think for BDS they have I think
Belden and Bill. Bill both you Know clarified with BDS team about the uop.
I think we have some plan in place. There is a change in the cost as well.
Previously it was 23 900, something like that. Now it is 2700 with the
increase of 3000 on top of it. And those things will have to go through the
CR process like update the addendum in the state of work and then they have
to update the PO as well. So promote this is FYI for you and we probably
need to work on the CR process to catch all these things in the po.
Neil25:28
Yeah, yeah.
Promote25:29
We definitely need to raise a CR for the po. Financials. I think we should
be able to manage that.
Pramod25:36
Yes, yes. Financials it's only 3,000 on top of it. So I think we have to do
that.
Srinam25:41
And.
Pramod25:43
Yeah, anything apart from that.
Kunal25:46
Yes, yes. So present as present. The service ownership is one point. Other
point is regarding the move as the application. So for the total portal,
the current support contract is. So if you're going live on the 27th of
October, what's the plan from the November. Is it separate contact to be?
Pramod26:07
Yeah, we have already initiated the conversation with Akim Pregler in one
of the forum. I think she has to, you know, come back to the plan. It is
not only about the new contract over managing the application at Hannibal.
It is also there are a few questions also we have raised. I think we. We
have to get done something for them. Yeah.
Promote26:27
So PR has already initiated those conversations with every vendor,
supplier, Kemal and everyone. So we will definitely hear back if you have
any feedback from them. Otherwise there will be definitely a separate
contracts.
Pramod26:43
Yeah, that is one thing from both. One is we are talking about a manpower
to do the production support. Right.
Promote26:50
So they have the conversation again that's happening at the broader level.
Yeah. So that again we should have more feedback on that maybe by early
next month. Paul and team are definitely looking into it.
Pramod27:06
License has full right.
Promote27:11
One is O and M operate and maintain which is support. Another is license
and third is the TSA contracts. So all three are getting worked parallel.
Pramod27:24
Good, thank you. So Kunal, anything apart from this?
Kunal27:27
No, that's it.
Pramod27:29
That's it. Right? No, no other risk. Right. The SS was the only piece that
we are talking about. Nothing other than that. Right. Timeline, Spice, all
good. Tmc, all the test cases we have, all the super users is identified.
Right. The only thing what I. What I. What we need here is we need to
enable the conversation with BDS and TFC to do the kickoff. They need to
stop the work. That's what we have to do. Yeah. I've been telling this
tuition as well. Good. Thank you. On trade complaints. I think we are
running out of time. Yes. Trade. This is fine. I mean, there were a few
issues until last week. You know, we were. We were asking about the
successor for Sashi because Sashi has taken up a different role, and now we
have Nitin Kulkarni, I think, who. Who has to, you know, provide some
direction on the trade side. I don't see any.

<div style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">It and yeah we =
my plan is to because now we have some sort of timelines on the testing the=
 UAT testing for the applications that are in scope and we do have the test=
 cases as well the baseline test cases for all the applications and we alre=
ady figured out the super users for each of the applications. So since you =
know we have we have the alignment in all the three cases. I&#39;ll probabl=
y schedule a call with the super users to review the test cases. Probably o=
ne manufacturing call for all the manufacturing applications with the manuf=
acturing super users. Likewise we can do that for all other functions as we=
ll to make sure the super users are aligned with the UAT timeline, they&#39=
;re aligned with the test cases, they align with the accesses and from that=
 now we can take it forward to do the testing. I&#39;ll probably now said s=
omething maybe the end of June or something like that and probably we don&#=
39;t need to talk more about this. It&#39;s a useful slide. If you have any=
 questions you can reach me out. And yeah this is where we are with regards=
 to the timeline. We are done with the design for all the architecture, the=
 design and everything is completed. The only part is some design review is=
 in progress with a couple of applications web broker taller and we are tar=
geting to complete in a week or so but the build is already in progress for=
 most of the applications at least the discussions and stuff like that and =
you know we will be able to march towards the timeline. Whatever I have giv=
en here. Yeah this is the usual slide with the partnership between the IT s=
orry the entity honeybal versus the third party vendor. So you know we are =
just using the slide as a reference for that. So here is the plan we have W=
herever you see as yellow highlighted we still need to reconfirm this with =
the respective function leads but anything without the yellow highlighted t=

now we will be able to complete the UATN test on time as per the timelines =
that I have updated here. So the only thing is for the buy value of AP 900 =
I have given the timeline based on my thought process. I created some high =
level scheduled and I reviewed that with Rahul and Nare Daniel. I schedule =
a call next week with with the business and it it&#39;s basically a call to=
 portray about the the timelines for completing the ABS of functionality, t=
he Capslon functionality and also you know when we are going to engage peop=
le to do the testing right and also we can utilize the call to do some sort=
 of solution walkthrough because Anyway, we are going to, you know, it&#39;=
s going to be the same functionality in brdbrd but we have to make the cust=
omization on top of it to make it work for aim and we will showcase on, you=
 know, what is the way to move forward, how we are going to approach the so=
lution. Something like that. Okay. I set up a call on that. So it&#39;s dai=
ly, not a call Daniel or someone from sourcing organization. No. Daniel, yo=
u there?</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgroun=

Yeah. Whatever you see here, some of the things, you know we are not going =
to do any testing because those are going to spin with site. There are no o=
pportunity to do the testing. It should ideally work. Some of the applicati=

and of course if it is working today and it should work tomorrow and wherev=
er I have highlighted in the amber color like with broker ebay student that=

. Yeah, so of course there are a few changes going on. The core changes tha=

ee on the screen. Two, the business manager applications which Steve Dellar=
d is managing partnering with Yaritza. And three, the applications which fo=
r IEC like the CS applications where we need to probably go to the other wo=

and what is the disposition or what is the status on those applications. An=
d that&#39;s where I need someone like either you or me to really coordinat=

. And now in this call, I heard there was another one with Steve Delat with=
 business Managed Application. So there are at least five. And there is. Th=
at&#39;s why I was asking Pierce and Paul Offline in an email that can brin=

testing are getting pinged by multiple folks across work streams. And so we=
 just want to express the proper plan across these work streams so that the=

ut the SSO approach last week. I think we&#39;ve been talking about this in=
 all of our calls, internal calls. There are a few things happening like in=
 terms of at least we know understood about the high level approach on what=
&#39;s going to happen during day one versus day two. So now the applicatio=
n team is working on identifying the use cases. Wherever they see any impac=
t on their application, they are just going over those things and working w=
ith the SSO team to understand some clarity on that. Right. Because the fir=
st and foremost question is they have given all these guidelines from the f=
raud production system standpoint. Okay, then how are we going to do this t=
esting in the QA environment, the lower end when it is a question. So now t=
he team is, you know, kind of identifying the test cases and also, you know=
, setting up a meeting with the SO team to understand more clarity on this =
before we get into the product development. Right. So these are the applica=
tions that I have put here, like Taller ui, Sparta, Web Broker. Those are t=
he only applications that are going to get impacted during day one. So that=
&#39;s where in our functionalities from IT side they are having conversati=
ons with the team on that. So there are no questions here. Probably we can =
move on to the next slide. So these are some of the use cases that I was me=
ntioned about before. Right. These are the very general use cases as of tod=
ay that came into our mind. But this is what you know, they have to further=
 drill down more and understand with regards to each of the application and=
 then they need to do the testing before we get into production.</div></div=

he vendor and extract extraction activity we have planned this week. One po=
int I would like to highlight which is mentioned in the this column is we h=
ave what decision that we will move to the on prem version for the UI sched=
uling Tool from the Azure because of the CGMP compliance and based on that =
what has happened now today we have a global domain within Honeyware only w=
here we are going to move the servers so there will be one more migration w=
hich will be happening from the global domain to spinco domain in the month=
 of September October time frame which was something which we discovered la=
st week Just want to share that would like to understand how much we will n=
eed to involve vendor in this whole process and whenever we are ordering ne=
w servers right now we need to decide a path who can be the server owner To=
day server owner is the service owner right now which is within Honeywell b=
ut whenever we are ordering new server for the application which will be on=
 prem need to understand who can be that service server owner so need some =
guidance in that area we do have integration with the Documentum limbs and =
SATC where we are connecting to them and the XSOPs Google has taken at leng=
th what are the different questions or queries we people have and we are tr=
ying to set up a call with SSO team and get that clarified.</div></div><div=

kay. Yeah. I think what we see here is everything is going in the right dir=

 this is going to work. During day one we need to do some QA testing, low l=
evel environment testing. Then EY is going to deploy the things not on the =
cloud and on the on prem which is on the local sales or server. And we we a=
re getting from you know the site cut over the DCN team that they are takin=
g Muskegon as a pilot that they are going to start the work from July. But =
for the rest of the larger sites like any case MER or Baton Rouge and stuff=
 like that, I think they are going to take the during September time frame =
which means that all the network change, the firewall change, the domain ch=
ange for the site specific cutover will happen only during September Octobe=
r time frame. If that is the case, how do we ensure that you know the testi=
ng and stuff like that, you know during our qa, you know the UAT testing I&=
#39;m talking about. Right. Because we are targeting the go live itself by =
October. If they themselves, you know take their time to complete the cutov=
er during September October, then how do we ensure to do the testing before=
 that question. So that is still a risk I think. Pramod, we talked about it=
 in our internal call today. Right. We need to keep some plans ready.</div>=
