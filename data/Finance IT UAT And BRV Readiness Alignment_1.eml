Finance & IT UAT and BRV Readiness Working Session

*Date:* June 11, 2025
*Time:* Not specified (morning in some time zones)
*Attendees:* Finance leadership and IT team leads, process area owners,
ERP, Supply Chain, ISE teams, among others.
*Main Objective:* Align Finance and IT on User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and
Business Readiness Validation (BRV) activities, system scope, test windows,
ownership, and key next steps before the overall BRV Readiness Workshop on
June 25, 2025.
------------------------------
1. Meeting Context and Opening

   - Established as a much-needed collaboration across Finance, IT, and
   supporting functions.
   - Supply Chain session was held June 10, HR to follow on June 12.
   - UAT kickoff occurred in May, with ongoing cross-functional discussions
   since.
   - Primary focus is BRV readiness, system impacts, testing schedules, and
   clear ownership of activities, especially as UAT commences.
   - Noted conflict with other meetings but prioritized due to urgency.

------------------------------
2. Main Topics Discussed2.1. Meeting Logistics & Recording

   - Difficulties with recording on Honeywell side; Copilot turned on to
   capture notes.
   - Final action items and summaries will be circulated due to lack of
   full recording.

2.2. UAT and BRV Scope Alignment

   - *Purpose:* Clarify which systems are impacted, what testing is planned
   (full/partial/none), key dependencies, and roles.
   - Reviewed an Excel list of relevant Finance systems (Black Line, Sbase,
   Hyperion, Workiva, PowerApps, etc.) for validation and updates.
   - Explicit confirmation required from both Business and IT for systems
   in use, their status (e.g., TSA, Buildback, Live Without), and the plann=
ed
   level of UAT.

2.3. Testing Windows and Coordination

   - Standard preliminary test window identified as July 7=E2=80=9311, 2025=
 for
   most systems.
   - Certain platforms (e.g., Hyperion HFM) need extended testing,
   dependent on ERP UAT outputs and further functional collaboration.
   - Recognized dependencies, e.g., requiring ERP UAT completion before
   some Finance system UAT can begin.

2.4. Entry & Exit Criteria for UAT

   - There is a draft of entry and exit criteria that needs further review
   and approval by process area leads and IT.
   - Emphasis on being specific for UAT Sign-offs and ensuring unambiguous
   standards for testing success.
   - Will circulate the slide on these criteria post-meeting for wider
   review.

2.5. Roles & Responsibilities: Ownership of Testing, Scripts, and Scenarios

   - Need for clarity on who develops scenarios, scripts, loads them into
   platforms, and facilitates the process.
   - Many systems missing confirmed business UAT leads; TBCs (to be
   confirmed) noted throughout.
   - Discussion on handover between legacy teams and Solstice (AM) users
   for UAT responsibility.
   - Noted some resource turnover (e.g., Workiva=E2=80=99s business UAT foc=
al Peter
   Tonki left organization; temporary assignment to Chad Montgomery, more
   permanent to be appointed).

2.6. Test Scenario Preparation

   - Finance functional teams have begun and in some cases completed
   top-level scenario development.
   - IT teams still need to receive, align, and translate these into formal
   test scripts in some areas.
   - Emphasis on sharing scenarios across teams for consistent coverage.

2.7. System-Specific Discussions & Notes

   - *Sbase/Hyperion/HFM/Planning:*
      - Sbase: Only data validation required from users; full test window.
      - Hyperion (HFM): Needs full UAT, dependent on ERP UAT data; testing
      to extend beyond July 11.
      - Hyperion Planning: Only access validation.
      - Distinction between platforms stressed (remove ambiguity: Hyperion
      =3D product suite, specifics matter).
   - *Black Line & Workiva:*
      - Follow up needed to assign focal points and clarify UAT
      requirements, especially post-resource changes.
   - *Finance PowerApps:*
      - Under TSA for Day 1; limited UAT required. Workflow
      buildback/replication deferred to Day 2/=E2=80=9C1.5=E2=80=9D phase (=
November=E2=80=93December).
   - *Hierarchy Management Platform:*
      - Ownership falls to IMA; requires follow-up for business lead and
      requirements.
   - *Concur:*
      - Limited UAT for access validation only; Priya Pillai and Smitha
      tentatively assigned as business leads.
   - *SAP, FSCM (Credit/Collections/Dispute), LCR Dixon, Eddycom,
   Paymetric, Taxware, CCX, Banking, etc.:*
      - Case-by-case review of scope, responsible leads, degree of testing,
      and outstanding questions.
      - Some modules (e.g., LCR Dixon) will be excluded due to no changes.
      Others (e.g., FCCS/Taxware) need limited UAT.
      - For areas like =E2=80=9CBanking,=E2=80=9D distinction made between
      outgoing/incoming flows, with different business and IT focal
points to be
      confirmed.
   - *HighRadius (HRC Cash App):*
      - Under TSA for Day 1; waiting for final decision from CFO on Day 2
      (whether =E2=80=9CLive Without=E2=80=9D or buildback).
      - Full UAT required regardless for onboarding bank accounts.
      - Testing planned June 23=E2=80=93July 4 remotely, then July 7=E2=80=
=9311 onsite,
      pending remote phase completeness.

2.8. Data and Environment Readiness

   - QA environment generally available for most Finance systems;
   historical data in place, transactional data to align post-ERP UAT.
   - Known dependencies and sequencing challenges highlighted, with need
   for updated QA, new company codes, and entity configuration for SAP FI.

2.9. Resource, Access, and Future Credential Planning

   - Day 1 credentialing: Employees get new email and credentials,
   specifics vary by TSA/Non-TSA system.
   - All current users expected to maintain access for testing; future
   provisioning processes discussed for Solstice and retired Honeywell
   credentials.

2.10. Missing Items & Additions

   - SAP integration testing not covered in full; will require additional
   cross-functional resource identification.
   - Specific callouts for PI/integration layers, legal entity
   configurations, and areas where supporting teams (e.g., controllership,
   tax, regional) must be looped in.

------------------------------
3. Action Items3.1. System/Testing Ownership

   - *Assign/confirm business UAT leads* for all listed applications
   (follow-up especially needed for Black Line, Workiva, Hierarchy Manageme=
nt,
   SAP FI, country tax leads for Telecom/Taxware).
   - *Clarify access/escalation issues* for Workiva and others with recent
   personnel changes.

3.2. Scenarios, Scripts & Test Plans

   - IT teams to *review Finance functional scenarios* (from Timmy/Andrew's
   list) and confirm or supplement with additional scripts as needed.
   - *Share scenario lists* with relevant IT/functional teams ASAP.
   - Identify and close any gaps in scenario/script coverage by early next
   week.

3.3. Environment & Data Readiness

   - Align on *QA/test environment usage* for each application; note data
   dependencies, especially where ERP UAT outputs are required.
   - *Confirm with PI/integration teams* for cross-platform workflow and
   integration tests.

3.4. Scheduling & Logistics

   - Finalize and *document testing windows* per system; account for
   exceptions (e.g., Lease Accelerator date to move).
   - Confirm *locations/access* for all testers by function/system.
   - Circulate updated system ownership/testing Excel sheet and the
   Entry/Exit Criteria slide.

3.5. Follow-ups

   - *Escalate selection of new business leads* (Workiva, Hierarchy
   Management).
   - *Consult tax, regional teams* for in-country testing (Telecom/Taxware)=
.
   - Coordinate with IMA (Rajesh) for hierarchy platform testing.
   - Follow up with Vivek or Rory for Lease Accelerator UAT lead.
   - Set next session for continued discussion and gap closure early next
   week.

------------------------------
4. Follow-ups and Next Steps

   - *Next Meeting:* Early next week (week of June 16, 2025); invite to be
   circulated, include all relevant workstreams, with objectives of gap
   closure and final system/test plan confirmation.
   - *BRV Readiness Workshop:* June 25, 2025, in Charlotte =E2=80=93 all fu=
nctions
   to provide status and readout.
   - Circulate meeting notes, action items, and updated Excel/criteria deck
   within 24 hours.
   - Requests for any *further questions, comments, or requirements* can be
   parking-lotted and addressed in dedicated sessions or offline
   communications.

------------------------------
5. Key Points of Emphasis

   - UAT and BRV are highly interdependent with other business functions;
   strong cross-team communication is mandatory.
   - Clear assignment of ownership (business and IT) is currently lacking
   for several systems; closing this is a priority.
   - Coordination on data, script, and environment readiness is crucial for
   successful and timely UAT.
   - Access/credential changeover for Day 1 is on track but will need
   ongoing monitoring.
   - This is an iterative effort with multiple follow-ups expected over the
   next two weeks.

------------------------------

*End of Summary* (All participants thanked; Copilot capturing additional
notes for review. Next steps to proceed via updated documentation and
scheduled follow-ups.)

Rakesh0:24
We'll give it a few more. I think there were a few people that did not
respond. Quite a few that have. So let's. Yeah. Hi, everyone.
Srinivas0:36
Good morning.
Rakesh0:41
Hey, Shivas. Long time no chat.
Srinivas0:47
Hello.
Rakesh0:50
Should have you on. I should have you on speed dial by now. All right. Hey,
welcome, everybody. Good morning. Good evening. We'll get started in a
minute. Andrew, the man of the hour.
Srinivas1:13
You know what? I have four meetings conflicting with this.
Rakesh1:16
I. I hear you, I hear you. So thank you for prioritizing this and hopefully
this will make it, you know, as productive as the supply chain one, if not
better. I think, you know, Andrew, Timmy and the team. Michael and the team
have, are superstars. So we'll make sure we get the most out of it. So. So
Mac, you do, if you do want to pull up the. The deck, page one of the deck.
And then Andrew, Timmy, I presume Will is on pto.
Andrew1:51
Yep, Will is trying to be on pto, we should say. But yeah, he will not make
this meeting.
Rakesh1:57
Okay, so I do know a lot of the POCs have been invited into this on the
finance side, all the list you had sent out earlier for the process areas.
So we'll make sure that's there. So a couple of minutes in, let's see if we
can start recording here. I'm unable to start recording. We can turn on
copilot if it's not. Is someone on the Honeywell side able to start
recording on this? It may or may not work. Let's see.
Srinivas2:28
No, it's disabled for me.
Rakesh2:29
Disabled. Okay, but copilot is on, right, I presume, Mac? Yeah, yeah,
copilot is on Rakesh. Okay. All right, so then at least we will get good
notes from here and we'll summarize action items as well. Got a couple of
people living here, not letting in outside. Okay, they are all in. So let's
get started. Let's go to the agenda side. So thank you everyone for making
the time today. This, I think this conversation's been perhaps much
overdue. We've been doing this between all of the IT work streams and all
of the other functions. Yesterday we did supply chain, today we're doing
finance and then tomorrow hr. But again, I think the point here is really,
as UAT is starting, we wanted to understand primarily from a BRV readiness
perspective. We wanted to get these teams together and align. There have
been a lot of conversations with a UAT kickoff in May and a follow up
conversation across all the process areas in the middle of May. And since
then the ask has Been to understand, you know, what systems are in play,
what systems are actually changing, what systems get touched as part of
functional process changes and process testing that needs to happen. So
there's quite a few conversations that need to be had to align on those.
This is very much looking to be a working session between the work streams
and the finance function and this area owners the process area leads. We
also have few test windows that have been put in play and so we have a view
of that. I know we've got the ERP team here and as well as some of the
supply chain team. So ISE team. So we do want to confirm some of the
testing dates and windows that have been published and see if they make
sense in the context of business resource availability both for BRV as well
as for day one. Because I think some of the finance activities we'll have
to see as the systems get ready over the next few weeks and UAT is on where
does functional testing happen and then you know, at least for BRV and then
to the point, you know, for finance and the process areas or even much
later for more close when does you know when do the environment and data
need to be available for that for as we get to day one we do have a slide
here on the entry exit criteria. If we are not able to get to that, I do
want to share that with all of you so that you can take a look at that and
refine that or work with the workstream IT workstream leads to finalize
that so that when you do get the sign offs as we come, you know, as we do
talk through, you know the UAT sign offs we do want to be very specific
about what the entry exit criteria there. We will try and get to the roles
and responsibilities around. You know what this is bit more so aligned to
some of the logistics as well. But you know who's developing the scenarios,
who's developing test scripts, what sort of automations there have we
aligned on it, who's loading that in, who will help, you know, facilitate
that etc so we'll get to it if we can or we want to get to it. We'll see
you know, if we're able to more importantly test scenarios. I touched on
this, you know, I know the finance function has been developing test
scenarios across the processes air process areas. I should say so thank you
for that. I think part of the conversation here today is connecting with
the ERP IT finance supply chain teams to see have we converted those, have
we aligned on those scenarios to convert them to test scripts? What test
scripts is already being developed and is available, what may need to be
developed as a new net new and work through that conversation as well. So
we may not be able to get to all of it today. We will certainly in the hour
that we've planned. If it's not, if we are not able to, we will certainly
take action items and follow ups and we'll look to schedule additional
conversations on that over the next coming days and certainly by next week.
Because as many of you may have heard, you know, there's an overall BR V
readiness workshop happening on the 25th that's being organized by the PMO
in Charlotte. And so each of the functions are expected to come in there
and provide a status update and a readout similar to the gate deliverables
on, you know, the readiness across the functions and it will be doing the
same as well. So we do certainly want to make sure that we have these
conversations over the coming days then to get ready, align on all, all the
remaining items, close out any open issues and then get UAT kicked off. So
I said quite a bit there, please, you know, do stop us and ask us. You
know, I do want this to be a working session. So do ask questions as much
as you want. We'll try to address them here. If not, we'll parking. Parking
lot that and come back and address it later. Do want it to be interactive.
So before we kick things off, any other questions or comments from the
team? I guess Andrew, perhaps something from your end if you have any other
expectations or takeaways or outcomes you need for the finance function
here.
Andrew8:01
No thanks Rakesh. I think just again, clarity on who's on first, who's on
second, who's doing what. And I think that's obviously an output of this
meeting. So no, no, no additional input. Just looking forward to getting
specifics on next steps.
Rakesh8:16
Okay. And yeah, certainly expound on that as well because I think some. So
let's get, you know, as we get into it, let's look at the systems in scope
and ownership. If you go to the next slide, actually if you want to pull up
the, the Excel, one of the things that you sent us all was Andrew, across
these process areas, you had these seven or eight systems that were getting
touched. What we want to do is make sure that we've got the right names in
here and make sure that one from a business side understand who the
business UAT lead would be from. From an IT side, we also want to
understand what is the scope of testing. So two parts to this One from a
finance perspective, finance IT perspective, we want to make sure that all
the systems are captured. If there are additional systems that are getting
tested, we want to make sure, and we understand from a function side, these
are the systems that are getting touched as part of the process areas. So
let's, you know, go through this list and make sure that, you know, this is
the list of, this is the list of the systems and if there's any other
systems that we need to add. And so let's walk through this. Perhaps I'll,
you know, we do have, I think the area owners here. I'm not sure if Harry
is here on this call, but if somebody else can speak to the IT finance
side. I don't know if Srinivas, if you have additional information here.
Srinivas9:56
Yeah, I have Steve here on the call, so probably Steve could comment for
Black line Sbase Hyperion, Workiva. And we do. I do see Caesar as well.
Steve, you're on mute. We are speaking on mute.
Caesar10:18
What's the actual ask?
Rakesh10:21
So making sure that. So first ask is from a, from a function perspective or
their perspective. These are the apps that they have listed as being in
scope for them. So what is the testing that is required from an IT
perspective here for these apps? So it's column G we want to make sure
essentially. Are you looking to do a full uat, some sort of a partial UAT
here? This app is on a TSA if we understand it correctly, for day one. But
for BRV and for, you know, in and around August 1st, what is it that we're
looking to do in terms of testing here? You know, is it just cursory
testing, no testing? Are you looking to do a full blown UAT on this? What
is the plan today?
Caesar11:11
Okay, I can speak to from a functional perspective on essbase, hfem and
planning. So for essbase though, the only UAT that we need is data
validation. So everything else will be done from a systems perspective.
Integrations and data and performance will be done from techno functional
side. But from a user we will only need data validation. Testing.
Rakesh11:44
Okay. And I think there's a column next as well. In terms of the testing
dates. Do you have. And we'll certainly get to that here. I don't think
it's. It's in here yet. But let me ask you this test.
Srinivas12:01
So testing will be. Sorry for the interruption. Testing will be from July
7th to July 11th.
Rakesh12:07
Okay.
Srinivas12:10
Yeah, July 7th to 11th across Sbase Hyperion planning.
Rakesh12:18
Okay, so. Okay, good point. So we'll add that to essbase and the two
Hyperion. Now, test scripts and test scenarios. I know Timmy and the
function have put together test scenarios across these process areas. Have
you aligned with them on where we are with test scripts for these? In this
particular case, it's data validation, but for some of the others, say
Hyperion. Do we have the test scripts defined?
Caesar12:49
Let's just try and be specific. Hyperion is the platform, not the product.
So sbase Hyperion. HFM is Hyperion Planning is Hyperion and they serve very
different goal. So if we can be more specific and ditch the Hyperion part
so we are clear on who. Who's testing what. So with that said, FOR s face,
the only test I. We have a meeting later today to start talking about test
scripts for. For. For all the EPM platforms. So that's in development.
Let's put it that way.
Rakesh13:31
Okay. Now, would it help if we, and I think Andrew and Timmy, from a
function perspective, you've developed test scenarios for all the process
areas. Would it help then for us to share that with you or for you guys to
share it so that Srinivas and Cesar and Steve and the team have that as
they develop test scripts across the board? I presume the answer is yes,
but I don't know if it's been shared with them yet.
Caesar13:59
If somebody has them, I'll take them.
Rakesh14:01
Okay.
Srinivas14:02
Yeah.
Steve14:02
I'll share with you what we have so far. There wasn't a lot for essays.
Well, let me show you what I have.
Caesar14:10
Squeeze. Test scenarios are going to be users connecting and validating
that their current reports are pulling the. The same data that they. That
they are. That they have in production. It's as simple as that.
Rakesh14:24
Okay.
Caesar14:25
HFM will probably need to go a little deeper and will probably extend past
the July 11th because we'll have to get a file from the UAT that's running
for the ERPS and then have the users load. We're working with the
controllership team to have a couple of rounds of testing even beyond the
July 11 test date. For Hyperion planning, it's TS8, so it's going to be run
on the current platform, so no testing required. All right. If I went too
fast.
Harry15:00
Yeah, yeah.
Rakesh15:00
No, no, no. But good information. So we'll capture that. Yeah. So for
Hyperion planning.
Steve15:07
Yeah, yeah. To add on what Caesar said. So, you know, all of these apps are
TSA for day one, but there's new development within the system to build
out. Then there's a concept within sbace and within hfm, a concept called
application. So there's new applications being built in, even though it's a
TSA within.
Andrew15:32
From.
Steve15:32
The TSA perspective for a day one planning, it's just access. It's just
ensuring that user access for the logical separation, which is a little bit
different there. So that's why planning is a little different than the
other ones as far as the level of testing that's required.
Rakesh15:50
Okay, so for Hyperion planning we'll say simply access validation and
access testing. Okay. And then for hfm you're expecting a full blown uat.
Caesar16:02
Yes. So it's going to be a, a more in depth testing.
Rakesh16:09
Understood.
Caesar16:11
Just to make sure that users are able to load data and that the
consolidation is running as expected. But again, that one's probably going
to run throughout the month of July just in preparation of brb.
Rakesh16:26
Okay, so a few points to note there. So on Hyperion hfm, on the testing
required, we will say full blown testing or full UAT with, you know, data
requirements. Now, do you have not to jump into the rabbit hole here. I
know we haven't talked of environments. Do we have alignment on what
environment will be available for testing?
Caesar16:56
Qa.
Rakesh16:57
QA across the board for all of these?
Caesar16:59
Yes.
Rakesh17:00
Okay. And do we have the data needed for this testing? Is it? I think what
we heard yesterday from SRI is that, you know, CIQ has been updated with
recently with CIP data. But in this case for these, do you have the
necessary data in qa?
Caesar17:25
There's a two part answer to that. Historical data. We have it, we're
working on it. So we're good on that front. For the actual test, we will
have to wait for the ERP to complete their UAT so we can have an output
files or a set of output files that we can then test load test into hfm.
That's why I'm saying that it might run beyond the July 11th date.
Rakesh17:51
Understood. Okay. So Srinivas, you aligned with that?
Srinivas17:55
Yes.
Rakesh17:57
Okay. All right, so we will make good information. So we'll capture that
here. So I think the takeaway here is. Yes. In QA environment, historical
data available, any transactional data you need, you will get that from a
dependency perspective in the sequencing. ERP teams will finish their UAT
and then the data from there will be leveraged here. And that will likely
run later than as you said for all of July. For that. Is that the case for
all of these 11 items here and nine items here.
Caesar18:42
Right now?
Steve18:44
No, no, that, that would, would not be. It's, it's, it's varies App by app.
Rakesh18:48
Okay, so sorry, I don't mean to jump all over the place. So perhaps let's
start with Black Line on top. Do we know if there's any testing required
there? Is that the same thing as, as the prior, what was the term you used,
Steve? I, I forget.
Steve19:08
Is it, it's a tsa. There is some setup that is required there. It doesn't
look like we extended this to Satish or Rajan.
Rakesh19:20
So.
Steve19:22
I'm gonna need to get back to you on, on a couple of these items for Black
Line.
Rakesh19:28
Okay. Let's just note that in the comment. So we'll have a follow up in
action. You know, we'll follow up with you on Black Line. Okay.
Steve19:36
Now for Workiva, where Kiva is. I'll wait till you get that typed in there.
Rakesh19:45
We just say let's, let's just say follow up required with Steve.
Steve19:48
Yep, that's fine. I'll pull Rajan and Satish get the information.
Rakesh19:55
Okay. And then for Workiva.
Steve19:59
Now Workiva, Workiva is a build back application and the build back's
complete. Now to be kind of transparent, Workiva, due to the sensitivity of
the data. This is for the SEC reporting. This is almost a business managed
type application. It's a SaaS subscription based application. Now the
problem that we have at the moment is the, the resource that was identified
from controllership has left the organization and the company. So we're
looking for the replacement of Peter Tonki.
Rakesh20:41
Okay.
Steve20:41
And Caesar, I, I, I don't know if you're aware of that. I know you were put
there as a temporary to just validate access in the system, but you're not
going to be the one who's going to be performing the uat. So I, I think
that's still just an open item we, we, we need from controllership.
Caesar21:05
Yeah, I would probably escalate that with Wheel.
Andrew21:10
Yeah, yeah, we can take that. I think it temporarily it'll be Chad
Montgomery, but we can, we'll double check that.
Caesar21:18
Yeah. And they, I mean they just announced yesterday that the new CAO is
fired. So that should move pretty quick.
Rakesh21:32
I don't think that you said the new cio. C C, A, O, A O. Yeah, sorry,
sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. So, and then let's get to
Hyperion Planning then we said that is also simply the scope of testing
required is simply access validation.
Caesar22:00
Yep. And most of the users are carrying forward their access from last
year, so even that's going to be a 20 minute exercise.
Rakesh22:12
Perfect. Okay. So they don't need new logins or new access into the system.
Srinivas22:16
Right.
Rakesh22:16
Is it going to be.
Caesar22:17
No. The only, and that's probably more a future. I don't know if anybody
has an answer to that is how, how we're gonna work with new credential,
with assault this credentials in the Honeywell environment. But that's.
Rakesh22:37
So I think from an HR perspective, that won't happen till day one. So what
I generally understand as sort of the roadmap from, from the IAM team and
the Identity team is that everybody will get new email addresses and new
credentials starting. Certainly, you know, emails will be rolled out from
August, but certainly on day one, all the employees will be turned into
contractors in the HCM. And so any TS8 apps, you know, will refer to that.
And you know, there will be some, some work needed to go through the access
control lists and across all these apps to turn people into, you know, the
right privileges. Certainly for TS8 apps, you know, that will continue on
and then everybody else, the apps that are not in TSA, you know, you'll
certainly get Solstice credentials, SSOs, et cetera, but all of that is
being put in place. But there's probably work that needs to be done for
that for day one, certainly not for this testing.
Steve23:42
And I don't want to go down too much of a tangent, but for day one,
Solstice employees would be using their either H or E ID to log into TSA
apps. And then anything Solstice specific, they would be using their. What
is it? Their sid.
Rakesh24:02
Correct. Correct. That is the general thought because I think they're going
to use Zscaler and other tools to be able to, you know, tunnel back in or
log back in into the TS8 apps. So, but that is the general understanding
that, you know, you'll be able to use your hid, but you'll be turned as,
you know, persons of interest or whatever the terminology is within your HR
within the HCM systems, so that you will continue to have access to the TS8
apps.
Caesar24:34
Okay.
Rakesh24:35
Again, we can find more detail for you as to that, how that will work from
the IAM team.
Caesar24:41
Right. My point is from Hyperion Planning, that's probably the one test
scenario that we need to test before day one. Other than that, everything
is as usual.
Rakesh24:53
Okay. Okay. All right, how about finance power apps? Yep.
Steve25:06
This is this again. So this is, this is TSA for day one. So this would just
be validating the, the access and I would expect this to be limited UAT
required there.
Rakesh25:23
And then we're thinking the Testing here is also July 7th to 11th.
Srinivas25:30
Yeah, most likely we will probably follow the same schedule.
Rakesh25:34
Okay.
Max25:35
And Stephen, we're talking about PowerApps in general, not for a specific
workflow.
Steve25:41
Well, no, I mean this is only the Finance PowerApps. So the Power platform
team owns power apps across the enterprise because there's personal
productivity power apps but this is just the Finance PowerApps flows that
fall under finance that are supported by finance. So the personal
productivity PowerApps, that's something different. And plus all the other
flows outside of.
Max26:18
I'm asking. Let me ask the question. That way we do have a workflow which
we need to build back to replicating PowerApps since we will be dropping
the usage of UE5 for example for approval workflows that would fall here.
Right. So we're still building up the framework and kind of at the woods
close. Sorry, say that again.
Srinivas26:42
That's for day two, right? It's currently we not building any power. As for
day one today all of the power apps for within finance space for AP and A2R
will be part of your TSA.
Max26:57
Will be part of the T. Okay. Okay.
Srinivas27:01
Transition service agreement. Yeah.
Caesar27:04
Yes.
Max27:05
I was under the impression that it was probably. It was my bed. Okay, got
you. So if we covered until. Okay, that is. Okay, got you. Oh, I think I've
got the answer I was looking for.
Harry27:20
Yeah, I joined this call later B. Yes, that's tsa but it's not what they
choose sh from to bring back.
Srinivas27:30
Those apps for each.
Harry27:33
No, I know. I. I'm saying what is the date?
Srinivas27:36
I don't wanna hear back from them. Right. I think ha is driving the
conversations. He just waiting will they probably pick up this as 1.5
considering that EM365 tenant is already be there is.
Rakesh27:52
Is there?
Srinivas27:53
So.
Harry27:53
Yes. So I think about the. This will not wait until ERP physical
separation. That should be some November. Yeah. Yeah. Between November and
end of the year.
Max28:05
Okay. Okay, got you. So we still have time. So we still need to make a
proposal. Right. Because we. We do need a solution for. For no PO invoices
but let's say it's not that pressing. Right. It's not for 1st of August.
It's for.
Rakesh28:18
It's not for 1st of august. Yeah. Or for day one or for November 1st.
Max28:24
Oh good.
Rakesh28:25
Okay. No good, good.
Harry28:28
Just now you mentioned. Sorry, I just like really apologize from another
core concept. But you just now mentioned about UI5 drop off. It's great to
drop that non PO process but how about OOC I think we do not want to do
that as well. Right. This last call is calling. Remember we do not want to.
Srinivas28:55
Do.
Harry28:56
Back the auto cycle payment process.
Max29:00
I was under the impression that they both go out in bundle. Right. So if.
Yeah, so I need to find a different solution.
Harry29:11
Yeah, I saw somewhere they listed this ooch. Testing on August 1st. I think
August 1st we do not touch anything. But after this not PSA anyway. Right.
Rakesh29:28
So for August 1st we don't have it listed certainly. But if we need to and
we need to test anything for August 1st, we can certainly add it to this
list and make sure we understand the requirements around it. So maybe we
can take. Take that as an action item here.
Harry29:47
For all you do not have or have. Because I saw another file, maybe not this
file that said OOC validation someone put there from business and they want
to validate auto cycle payment about I want to align with you that really
need to validate or this. I think our agreement is this will not be build
back.
Max30:10
Correct.
Harry30:12
Okay. So should not be.
Rakesh30:14
So we shouldn't add it here.
Harry30:15
Okay, so we should not test this. Sorry.
Rakesh30:18
Yeah, so not. Not here. So yeah, let's remove that. Okay. How about
hierarchy management platform. So we said that to live without for day one.
Well, is that an IMA or is that.
Srinivas30:33
Yeah, I think we'll have to check this with Rajesh from ima.
Rakesh30:38
Okay, so if it is a live without, we certainly need to understand what sort
of testing and data etc. Okay, concur.
Srinivas30:47
This will be limited UAT because your.
Rakesh30:52
Build back the next one.
Srinivas30:56
Conquer.
Rakesh30:58
Yeah. Yep. So limited UAT access. Only access validation.
Srinivas31:06
Okay, same the duration again it's the same set to 11th.
Rakesh31:12
Okay, now for all of these we don't have a business UAT lead at least not
identified here.
Srinivas31:18
So Android for at least test base Workiva. I think we need to identify
Hyperion.
Rakesh31:26
So can we put those names here if you do have them handy for Black line S
base.
Srinivas31:33
Black line. I think it's going to be satish.
Rakesh31:35
Right. Okay.
Srinivas31:38
S base will be Caesar.
Rakesh31:41
Okay.
Harry31:45
So quick question. Who will be the business going to be today's corporate
business do the test or have to be AM users?
Caesar31:55
It has to be.
Srinivas31:56
Should be AM users. Yes.
Harry31:59
So we do not have I think either not every function they have person.
Right. AM today.
Caesar32:06
Right.
Harry32:07
That's going to be a.
Caesar32:08
You know, for S Base you would have to have like Mad Taburski and team.
Rakesh32:19
Okay, so can we replace scissor scissor with a matte T?
Caesar32:24
Yep.
Rakesh32:24
Or Cesar Will you also be part of that? No, just we just say Matt T.
Caesar32:30
I'm in an interesting situation.
Rakesh32:33
Okay, no worries.
Caesar32:34
I'm pitcher and catcher. So yes, technically I will be testing some and.
But the ultimate validation of the data will be Matt.
Rakesh32:42
Okay. It's C E S A R. C.
Caesar32:46
E S A R. Yes, thank you.
Rakesh32:51
All right. Workiva.
Steve32:57
I mean that's what earlier is mentioning. We don't have a replacement for
Peter. Somebody mentioned. Somebody mentioned potentially Chad.
Andrew33:07
So yeah, let's put Chad for now. Yeah. And then we'll validate that of
course.
Rakesh33:14
Okay, so then let's say TBC and to be confirmed, HFM Hyperion.
Caesar33:24
That would likely be Chad, JC and myself.
Rakesh33:35
Okay. Chad, Cesar and.
Andrew33:41
Hey Max. Sorry to jump in. Can we add JC's name up to Black line as well
with Satish.
Rakesh33:48
Okay. So can I know you? He goes by jc. But who is jc? Okay. All right.
Andrew33:57
I'm sorry. I know he's on so. Sorry.
Rakesh34:00
Jc. Yeah, sorry. Okay. All right, so Chad, Juan Carlos and Cesar. All
right. And then Hyperion Planning.
Caesar34:14
That'd be Matt as well. Well, I don't know if we have a BAP lead name yet,
but for now I think Matt's.
Rakesh34:22
So let's put TBC in that row. But yeah. Okay. The finance power.
Srinivas34:31
Yeah, this is a cross functional. I. Maybe you can keep a TBC for now.
We'll find out the names later.
Rakesh34:41
Okay. The hierarchy management, that's ima. We'll have to. But do we have
any business UAT lead here?
Srinivas34:51
No, we don't have anyone I think for that Hierarchy management on this call=
.
Steve34:55
Well, I mean Hierarchy management that's not owned by finance.
Srinivas34:59
So it's part of ima. So they're not.
Rakesh35:03
They're not. Yeah. I don't think they made this call. Okay, so let's. Let's
have a general comment there on hierarchy management to follow up with
Rajesh and Ima team and then for concur.
Srinivas35:21
It will be three years for now but allowed to find out who the dedicated
tne focal for Athens. For now you can keep Priya. Priya Pillai.
Rakesh35:32
Okay. Yeah.
Harry35:33
And you can add also Smitha.
Rakesh35:37
Okay. I think it's P R I P R I Y A. That's correct.
Srinivas35:41
Let me ping the name here.
Rakesh35:43
P I L L A I. Yeah.

ople living here, not letting in outside. Okay, they are all in. So let&#39=
;s get started. Let&#39;s go to the agenda side. So thank you everyone for =
making the time today. This, I think this conversation&#39;s been perhaps m=
uch overdue. We&#39;ve been doing this between all of the IT work streams a=
nd all of the other functions. Yesterday we did supply chain, today we&#39;=
re doing finance and then tomorrow hr. But again, I think the point here is=
 really, as UAT is starting, we wanted to understand primarily from a BRV r=
eadiness perspective. We wanted to get these teams together and align. Ther=
e have been a lot of conversations with a UAT kickoff in May and a follow u=
p conversation across all the process areas in the middle of May. And since=
 then the ask has Been to understand, you know, what systems are in play, w=
hat systems are actually changing, what systems get touched as part of func=
tional process changes and process testing that needs to happen. So there&#=
39;s quite a few conversations that need to be had to align on those. This =
is very much looking to be a working session between the work streams and t=
he finance function and this area owners the process area leads. We also ha=
ve few test windows that have been put in play and so we have a view of tha=
t. I know we&#39;ve got the ERP team here and as well as some of the supply=
 chain team. So ISE team. So we do want to confirm some of the testing date=
s and windows that have been published and see if they make sense in the co=
ntext of business resource availability both for BRV as well as for day one=
. Because I think some of the finance activities we&#39;ll have to see as t=
he systems get ready over the next few weeks and UAT is on where does funct=
ional testing happen and then you know, at least for BRV and then to the po=
int, you know, for finance and the process areas or even much later for mor=
e close when does you know when do the environment and data need to be avai=
lable for that for as we get to day one we do have a slide here on the entr=
y exit criteria. If we are not able to get to that, I do want to share that=
 with all of you so that you can take a look at that and refine that or wor=
k with the workstream IT workstream leads to finalize that so that when you=
 do get the sign offs as we come, you know, as we do talk through, you know=
 the UAT sign offs we do want to be very specific about what the entry exit=
 criteria there. We will try and get to the roles and responsibilities arou=
nd. You know what this is bit more so aligned to some of the logistics as w=
ell. But you know who&#39;s developing the scenarios, who&#39;s developing =
test scripts, what sort of automations there have we aligned on it, who&#39=
;s loading that in, who will help, you know, facilitate that etc so we&#39;=
ll get to it if we can or we want to get to it. We&#39;ll see you know, if =
we&#39;re able to more importantly test scenarios. I touched on this, you k=
now, I know the finance function has been developing test scenarios across =
the processes air process areas. I should say so thank you for that. I thin=
k part of the conversation here today is connecting with the ERP IT finance=
 supply chain teams to see have we converted those, have we aligned on thos=
e scenarios to convert them to test scripts? What test scripts is already b=
eing developed and is available, what may need to be developed as a new net=
 new and work through that conversation as well. So we may not be able to g=
et to all of it today. We will certainly in the hour that we&#39;ve planned=
. If it&#39;s not, if we are not able to, we will certainly take action ite=
ms and follow ups and we&#39;ll look to schedule additional conversations o=
n that over the next coming days and certainly by next week. Because as man=
y of you may have heard, you know, there&#39;s an overall BR V readiness wo=
rkshop happening on the 25th that&#39;s being organized by the PMO in Charl=
otte. And so each of the functions are expected to come in there and provid=
e a status update and a readout similar to the gate deliverables on, you kn=
ow, the readiness across the functions and it will be doing the same as wel=
l. So we do certainly want to make sure that we have these conversations ov=
er the coming days then to get ready, align on all, all the remaining items=
, close out any open issues and then get UAT kicked off. So I said quite a =
bit there, please, you know, do stop us and ask us. You know, I do want thi=
s to be a working session. So do ask questions as much as you want. We&#39;=
ll try to address them here. If not, we&#39;ll parking. Parking lot that an=
d come back and address it later. Do want it to be interactive. So before w=
e kick things off, any other questions or comments from the team? I guess A=
ndrew, perhaps something from your end if you have any other expectations o=
r takeaways or outcomes you need for the finance function here.</div></div>=

because I think some. So let&#39;s get, you know, as we get into it, let&#3=

, actually if you want to pull up the, the Excel, one of the things that yo=
u sent us all was Andrew, across these process areas, you had these seven o=

that we&#39;ve got the right names in here and make sure that one from a bu=

side, we also want to understand what is the scope of testing. So two parts=
 to this One from a finance perspective, finance IT perspective, we want to=
 make sure that all the systems are captured. If there are additional syste=
ms that are getting tested, we want to make sure, and we understand from a =
function side, these are the systems that are getting touched as part of th=
e process areas. So let&#39;s, you know, go through this list and make sure=
 that, you know, this is the list of, this is the list of the systems and i=

through this. Perhaps I&#39;ll, you know, we do have, I think the area owne=

 And so any TS8 apps, you know, will refer to that. And you know, there wil=

ainly for TS8 apps, you know, that will continue on and then everybody else=
, the apps that are not in TSA, you know, you&#39;ll certainly get Solstice=
 credentials, SSOs, et cetera, but all of that is being put in place. But t=
