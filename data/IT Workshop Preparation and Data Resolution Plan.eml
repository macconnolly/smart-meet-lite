IT Workshop Preparation and Data Resolution Plan

---
## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Updates on Mirror Changes and Deck =
Preparation
- Discussion about changes to the "mirror" (likely a document =
or shared workspace) and its distribution process.
- Mac owes an updated =
page, which will be sent to Paul and possibly replace a current deck.
- Request for adding links into the deck.
- Mac will update content =
slightly and reshare the link.
- Coordination between team members (Mac, =
Paul, Sakina) on who needs to send what and when.

### 2. Hyper Care =
Session Planning
- Prashant provides a brief update: work is needed with =
Doug Carter, Rachel, Rashid, and Paul to gather input for the overall =
Hypercam model.
- Rashid will be left out for now; focus is on working with=
 Paul and Doug Carter.

### 3. IT Connect and Agenda Finalization
- Sakina is awaiting content from UMAC and will reach out to Corey offline.
- Prashant and Lane asked to review the agenda.
- Goal: Send agenda to the =
chat group (including Paul) by end of day June 20, 2025.
- Specific follow-up for Prashant on outstanding items.

### 4. EIT Support Rollout & TSA Exit Workshop
- Discussion about EIT =
involvement in the TSA Exit Workshop; their input is needed for budget and =
resource planning.
- Concerns over scheduling conflicts with UAT (User =
Acceptance Testing), aiming to minimize unnecessary participation.
- Plan to coordinate with Paul regarding which specific people are needed =
from commercial teams.
- Decision for Sakina to clarify with Paul and =
update the agenda as needed.

### 5. Escalation: IT Org Headcount Data =
Discrepancy
- An issue with headcount data: numbers from HCN don't match =
org reality as per Paul's team's records.
- Escalated to Darcy (VP of HR) =
and Madison (EY counterpart), with a meeting scheduled for Monday morning.
- Goal: Resolve by Tuesday, June 24, 2025, so the HCN data aligns for the =
upcoming BRB UAT workshop and OPSEP call.
- Data source issues are =
longstanding=E2=80=94HR believes errors are at the system level, not in the=
 source files.
- The approved org model was initially 91 people, now 88 =
including all reductions.
- Deadline: HCN must be updated by Tuesday, June =
24, 2025.

### 6. Template Creation for Requisition Adjustments
- Lane requests help creating a quick template for adjusting outstanding =
job requisitions (related to rec ID changes and job descriptions).
- The template will be sent to Darcy for approval, who has previously =
rejected retitling requests.
- Prashant volunteers to create the template =
and circulate it within 10=E2=80=9315 minutes.

### 7. Meeting and Workshop=
 Logistics
- Upcoming team presence in Charlotte, with arrivals starting =
Sunday, June 22, 2025, through Tuesday, June 24, 2025, for the Decks DCN =
workshop.
- AGS team arrives Sunday night; others by Monday or Tuesday.
- BRV Workshop at "wave space" on Wednesday, June 25, 2025.
- Some team members have other engagements (e.g., CIO development program =
at Honeywell) on Wednesday afternoon.
- Plan for the team to regroup =
Thursday, June 26, 2025, to review critical activities and develop a =
T-minus plan for major deliverables.

And then any changes to the mirror =
and when we send it and how we prepare for it.

0:08
Yeah, Mac, I still owe you that updated page that we can send out, Paul, or=
 just replace the deck. I'm sending it to you now.

0:20
Yeah, yeah.

0:21
Can you add links in here, if you don't mind? I think you sent it to me, =
right? I have it, so just send me. Yeah, I think I know where it is.

0:29
Yeah, but I have an offline copy, so I'll just update the content a little =
bit and then re share the link.

0:35
Yep. Sorry, Mac, I was speaking over =
you.

0:37
No, you're fine. I'll ping you on it. Doesn't need to be here. I=
 need a link for you.

0:41
Okay, okay.

0:47
But thanks, patron. I'll get =
that sent out whenever I get it back from you to pull.

0:55
Yeah, thank you both. Moving on to the Hyper Care session. I know Rashid is=
 not on. Prashant, you want to give a brief summary on that?

1:08
Yeah, that's. That's another problem to solve. We are. We need to work. So =
two names, Doug Carter and Rachel Rashid. Myself, we need to. I'll keep =
Rashid out of it. So I'll say I need to work right now with Paul and these =
two to get inputs for the overall hypercam model.

1:42
Yeah.

1:48
Thanks, Prashant. So on all IT connect, I'm still awaiting content from =
UMAC and then Corey, who I see is not on, so I will connect with him =
offline. Prashant, Lane, I've sent you both the agenda, if you can review =
that. I want to send it to the chat with Paul and them by the end of the =
day today.

2:14
Yeah, absolutely. Sakina. So there's just one follow up =
I've got with Prashant on there. I've sent a few messages, so when you have=
 a chance, let me know what your thoughts are and then we can update =
appropriately but.

2:29
Specific content for EIT support rollout. I don't =
know what that means, Lane. I'm sorry.

2:37
Yeah, so what Paul means by =
that is during the TSA Exit workshop, there are specific sessions where he =
will want the EIT team to be involved because they will have a say in what =
the budget looks like, for example, and the number of resources that will =
be required to support some of the TSA Exit projects. So he's flagging to =
them and saying, hey, we need you to be involved in the workshop at these =
specific times. But we did. The reason that's important is because there's =
also UAT going on at the same time and he doesn't want to pull people in =
unnecessarily to the workshop. And he also wants it to be solstice led so =
to push his leadership team to make decisions as well. So that's kind of =
the thought.

3:32
So I guess if we. Then maybe we need to check with Paul,=
 who specifically he's thinking about. I know there's two people from =
commercial that we're anyway trying to bring because people are away.

3:48
Okay, I'll be. I'll ping Paul on the side how he wants to handle it, if he =
wants to voice it over, if he wants to show the slides and just the. The =
two agenda days and just highlight where he wants those folks to be =
involved. And we'll, we'll update that way. So I, I'll. I'll take that =
offline. I know you got a lot going on.

4:15
Thanks, Lane.

4:16
I do have one other escalation too, Sahina. It's related to the IT Org and =
that's important because it's going to roll up into the BRB UAT workshop as=
 well as the OPSEP call. So the issue is, is that the numbers that are =
being pulled from the HCN do not match the reality on the ground or the IT =
Org that Paul and team have developed. So this has been escalated to Darcy,=
 who's the VP of hr. She's meeting with our EY counterpart who's an =
individual named Madison. They're going to chat Monday morning and then =
we'll get Paul pulled into that to hash it out and see why there's an issue=
 with the HCM pool into the it, which we're talking.

5:09
Okay, sounds good. And so are we, you and I, Lane still connecting with =
Madison.

5:16
I. I chat. I got a hold of Madison and she escalated to =
Darcy.

5:21
Okay.

5:23
So no need to have that conversation that shortly.

5:29
Yeah, sounds good.

5:33
Can we, can we not do just like a PowerPoint=
 like override if we're not able to get resolve this by the time we reach =
the BRB workshop?

5:44
So they're not, they're not allowing it right now?

5:48
Yeah, we asked that up, Prashant. They would not allow. They said they=
 will only pull from the hdm and that was coming from their leadership. =
That was what Sakina and I. Yeah.

6:01
That'S why I had to include you in =
that, Lane. But yes, yes.

6:05
Okay, great question. And we've kind of =
thought ahead of that too. That's why we escalated it and said, hey, this =
meeting has to happen at the latest by Tuesday and you have to be able to =
update the HCN by Tuesday. And they said, yes, we can do that. So that's, =
that's, that's the path.

6:23
And then I guess, Prashant, another thing to=
 mention here is the holdup is really they want to see the source for what =
we are saying. We cannot show the source. Our source is what Paul showed us=
 at Mars Plains last week in his slide and his org chart. We cannot share =
that. That's confidential. And they said they need to see our source of =
truth.

6:43
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Sakina, just to give you some end lane =
historical context, so working with Sherry and our HR talent team who've =
been helping with this, Paul has shared all of the source files to them. =
Essentially, the source is HR started with 91 people and that's what our =
org model talked about. And we've gone through gate three, four, well two =
three four five, where we put it all together for them. They've =
consistently made some errors in how they represent it and it's not a new =
thing. Again, you're talking to Madison. You probably need to talk to Jen =
as well. Saloover. But they are the right people. They have the source data=
. They're just showing wrong numbers. So I think it's in their system that =
it needs to change. The numbers Paul has and the chart he has is all based =
on the 91 approved minus 1, minus 2. So it's now 89 minus the E band. The =
executive is 88. So we should be showing that and they have the source data=
. It's just that they're pulling things wrong and wrongly displaying things=
.

7:59
Yeah, and we can point that out all we want, but I think ultimately=
 what we have to do is we have to put the two clients together and make =
them solve it on the call. So. And that, that's Darcy and Paul with us in =
there as well. Okay. Because we, we can point them to the source data, but =
ultimately if, if we don't get on the call and force the issue with both =
clients, I don't think anything's going to happen and we'll keep running =
into the same issue.

8:31
Yeah. And by the way, just more context. Darcy =
used to report into Sukai earlier, so if Paul is not able to like level =
with her, we can have Sukai talk to her.

8:44
Okay. If there's, if there's=
 an issue coming out of that call, I will absolutely escalate.

8:53
Thank you everyone. Anything else to escalate or bring up here as a risk?

9:00
If someone has bandwidth for 30 minutes and can help me with creating =
a quick template, I would really appreciate it.

9:07
If this is related to the hiring one. Let me take a pass at it in =
background because I've got all the stuff and I can tackle that right now.

9:16
It was to do with the rec. Yeah, exactly. It was that rec ID change or=
 whatever. Needs a template again. It's to go back to Darcy, who's been =
like, shooting people down when they're requesting for retitling of.

9:33
Correct. I would. What I will do is I will create the template for any =
adjustments to outstanding requisitions of or. I don't know how. How they =
say it, but basically their JDs, their job descriptions. And I'll get that =
over to you in like 10 to 15 minutes. So it'll be a kind of, you know, it. =
Yeah, I'll send it to you and you let me know if there's any changes you =
want.

10:00
Thank you. I have a photo of what we kind of discussed with =
Paul. I don't know if you have it. I'll just forward that to you on teams.

10:07
Yeah, I've got it pulled up on my phone right now.

10:14
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

10:19
I wrote it down on a piece of grain=
, so I can send that to you as well.

10:28
Thank you, everyone. Have a =
great rest of your weekend.

10:32
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I =
know not to keep anything from contracts. Erica, I know you're the. We'll =
put you on the spot. Yug's not here. Andrew is busy sailing somewhere. So.

10:44
Yeah, no updates on our end, but we'll see you guys in Charlotte next=
 week.

10:50
That was quick. Okay, Gee. Okay.

10:57
What day does everyone arrive?

11:01
Good point. I get the Tuesday night. =
Others are coming in Monday night or so.

11:11
I think the HGS team will =
get.

11:13
There on Sunday evening for the Decks DCN workshop. Okay.

11:17
I might have to also come in now on Sunday night because of.

11:23
Some.

11:23
Of the AGS team will get there on Sunday night. You know, I'm =
not sure about every single member of the AGS team.

11:32
Okay, we do. Yeah, between Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, we will be there. =
But yeah, I think after the wave space, I think. I don't know when people =
are leaving, but we should talk as a team Thursday about, you know, the =
stuff we talked about this morning. Just as a. Just think through it as we.=
 As we look at all these things that you displayed there, Sakina. That's =
very tactical for next week. I think as we do a T minus plan for all of the=
 big ticket items. You know, Paul had a good view of his critical =
activities. I think we need to create something similar from the pages we =
have and come up with a game plan for each of the big ticket items. So =
we'll spend some time as a team Thursday just talking through that and =
laying it out.

12:15
Sorry, missed a big piece of this. We're going to the=
 wave space next week as well.

12:20
Wave space is where? The BRV workshop=
.

12:22
Oh, Wednesday. Okay. All right. Kind of good to know. So I have a =
CIO development program thingy at Honeywell that afternoon. Yeah, yeah, =

he&#x27;s flagging to them and saying, hey, we need you to be involved in =

Prashant, another thing to mention here is the holdup is really they want =

source is what Paul showed us at Mars Plains last week in his slide and his=
 org chart. We cannot share that. That&#x27;s confidential. And they said =
they need to see our source of truth.</div></div><div =

6">Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Sakina, just to give you some end lane historical =
context, so working with Sherry and our HR talent team who&#x27;ve been =
helping with this, Paul has shared all of the source files to them. =
Essentially, the source is HR started with 91 people and that&#x27;s what =
our org model talked about. And we&#x27;ve gone through gate three, four, =
well two three four five, where we put it all together for them. =
They&#x27;ve consistently made some errors in how they represent it and =
it&#x27;s not a new thing. Again, you&#x27;re talking to Madison. You =
probably need to talk to Jen as well. Saloover. But they are the right =
people. They have the source data. They&#x27;re just showing wrong numbers.=
 So I think it&#x27;s in their system that it needs to change. The numbers =
Paul has and the chart he has is all based on the 91 approved minus 1, =
minus 2. So it&#x27;s now 89 minus the E band. The executive is 88. So we =
should be showing that and they have the source data. It&#x27;s just that =
they&#x27;re pulling things wrong and wrongly displaying things.=

So. And that, that&#x27;s Darcy and Paul with us in there as well. Okay. =
Because we, we can point them to the source data, but ultimately if, if we =
don&#x27;t get on the call and force the issue with both clients, I =
don&#x27;t think anything&#x27;s going to happen and we&#x27;ll keep =
