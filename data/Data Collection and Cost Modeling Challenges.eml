   *Main Topics Discussed:*
   1.

      *Identification and Collection of Resource Data*
      - There is a gap in obtaining both internal and external labor data,
         particularly for applications like ServiceNow.
         - The team needs data on internal and external personnel
         associated with various applications and projects, and whether the=
se
         resources will be required standalone or as part of shared service=
s.
         - Data collection is ongoing, especially concerning labor costs,
         hardware, and software relevant to stranded and standard cost
analysis.
      2.

      *Cost Modeling Approach*
      - Existing cost models are based on contract team data, mainly
         allocations rather than actuals.
         - The current model (from gate three) divides costs into software,
         hardware, storage, licenses, and includes some mitigation
elements, but is
         considered a preliminary starting point.
         - Model requires revalidation and re-baselining as it reflects
         high-level allocations, not true bottom-up calculations.
      3.

      *Challenges Identified*
      - The team is struggling to collect actual, detailed labor and cost
         data in the required format.
         - The stranded cost analysis has lagged due to focus on the TSA
         (Transition Service Agreement) bottoms-up deliverable.
         - There=E2=80=99s a need to distinguish between resources required=
 for
         ongoing support ("standard" costs) versus one-off or transitional =
work
         ("stranded" costs).
      4.

      *Planned Actions and Next Steps*
      - The team plans to shift towards a bottom-up approach for
         standard/stranded costs, starting by collecting detailed data
from each
         work stream.
         - Possible alternative: Estimate based on overall resource
         allocation (e.g., what percentage of staff are needed for
ongoing support
         vs. those that may become redundant or stranded).
         - The team intends to re-baseline the dataset for accuracy, using
         the existing model=E2=80=99s structure but populating it with
validated, actual
         data.
      5.

      *Gate Deliverables and Focus*
      - Gate three data was allocation-based; next deliverable will require
         true bottom-up figures.
         - TSA bottom-up deliverable has taken priority, with stranded
         (standard) cost work to be the focus in the next project phase.
         - A game plan for stranded costs is needed for upcoming
         discussions and deliverables.
      6.

      *Open Items and Follow-ups*
      - Clarification needed on the next steps and game plan for stranded
         costs, as requested by Rakesh.
         - Finalization of the Excel/template for data collection and
         analysis.
         - Further internal discussion and planning needed before action.
      -

   *Key Dates Mentioned:*
   - Example hardware license end-of-life: December 2026 (used
      illustratively to explain calculations).
      - No other specific dates or timelines are finalized yet; next
      phase/gate timing implied but not precisely stated.
   -

   *Action Items:*
   - Continue data collection for internal/external resource costs.
      - Revalidate and re-baseline existing cost models using actual,
      bottom-up data.
      - Prepare and finalize an Excel plan/template for stranded cost
      analysis.
      - Develop and communicate a clear game plan for stranded costs to
      stakeholders (e.g., Rakesh).
      - Schedule further discussions as needed.

This conversation centers on addressing gaps in data collection and cost
modeling for internal/external resources, transitioning from allocated to
actual costs, and planning required deliverables for stranded and standard
cost analysis in upcoming project phases.
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Arit0:00
Any resource that you guys are that that is needed.
Unknown0:03
Okay so that's the gap.
Arit0:06
Let me show you one of the.
Unknown0:08
Yeah. So internal and external labor is one of the gaps. You said the items
in red from the contracts team for applications like ServiceNow.
Arit0:20
Yep. Just as like an. I'm just.
Unknown0:24
Yeah.
Arit0:56
If you looked at it hrit that we are looking for the internal personal and
the external personal. The concept was that how many external or the
internal person that is going to be added for a standalone output for the
movie as well applications and is going to be relevant till then date. Okay
and based on that we can find out the standard cost and there's no
mitigation associated okay so if you looked at the. If you looked at the
model mitigation is also added here mitigated and all. But there is any
action that is that needs to be done for the mic needed but we start
collecting this data that if we have the internal and external data the
reactor hardware or the software cost but probably that is the new hardware
that has a shell flight which is going to be end beyond the TSA the if that
can be added as part of the stranded cost. But yeah that data is still in
we are still collecting the data.
Unknown2:07
For stranded. Sorry for stranded.
Arit2:14
Not for a stranded basically for the the information that we can receive
from the cost prospector. Yeah. Whether it's labor, whether it's hardware
or it's software. Then we have to identify from ourselves that what would
be the standard cost. I'm just giving you a perception or I'm just giving
you a reference that suppose in and the hardware which is which is end of
Life probably in December 26th and the license cost is supposed to be
prepared till December 26. Then we have to find out that that is part of
the TSA or not or day one or not and then what how much cost is associated
from day one or the TSA and date till the license end date. Okay. Yes that
exercise that needs to be but we were struggling with the data so we were
struggling with the labor data. We're struggling with the the actual data
with the format that we were looking for. Okay that is the. That is the
chunk for this child it cost. Either we have to identify any other way to
do this maybe on the basis of any shared applications I'm just giving a
prospective yeah okay maybe maybe on the basis maybe on the basis of any
shared service which anyone has because they put it up as Athens build back
or the movers applications to support. So that could be for example they
have to add 200 employees to 200 resources to build back the. Are they
really required for the or not? If not, then that could be a standard cost.
Could be for one month, could be for two months. There's a mitigation we
can think about.
Unknown3:52
Yeah. So you're struggling with the data.
Arit4:02
Yep, this is the one.
Unknown4:10
So anything blank is that still needs to be filled out or.
Arit4:19
No. So this has to be revalidated because this is based on the allocation.
Okay. So till gate three we haven't had any bottoms of approach. This is
the data from the gate three. So we picked up the contracts value,
contracts amount, segregated that from the software and the storage or the
hardware or the software part of it and then put it up. It doesn't there
any mitigation up there. We just call it out here and mitigate that. But
this is, this was purely on the basis of the allocations. Now we have to do
it based on the basis of actual cost. Actual cost. And in terms of the
bottoms of approach that we are working on. Okay. On the bottoms up
approach. So this was totally on the basis of the allocations and the top
30 contracts or the contractual amount that we received. This was just a
starting point to understand and what would be the standard cost.
Unknown5:16
So it needs to be revalidated.
Arit5:18
Yeah, this complete needs to be revalidated. We can use this model because
this has the, this has the entire picture of it whether it's TSA duration,
monthly, yearly annual contracts, licenses, mitigation. We can. We can use
this, this template, but not the data. Because if you looked at the license
durations at 7 to 12 months, this was, this was all on the basis of the.
The contractual value that the contract team shared with us. And just to
find out, okay, look at the assumptions, it's clearly mentioned this.
Unknown6:10
Entire data set, you have to re baseline the entire data set.
Arit6:15
Yeah, because this was. This was based on the allocation.
Unknown6:18
Yeah, I hear that.
Arit6:19
We have to do it now. We have to deal with the business of the bottom shop
that's required or not.
Unknown6:26
So what would your game plan be to do this on the basis of bottom up? Like
where do you start?
Arit6:32
So our game plan was just to find out the data from the each work stream.
If we can. If not then we can find out that how much total spend that
Honeywell is or the how much total employee strength, the resource strength
that Honeywell is going to put it in for the, for the Athens to support the
day work. Okay. And on the basis that this is done, we can calculate that
could be the 10% of the workforce will be used as part of the f. But
remaining 80% or 90% could be the standard for. Yeah, but that. That was
all. That was all in the presumption space. You haven't though there was
much. There's not much progress in the standard course because of our focus
was the TSA Bottoms up. TSA Bottoms up was part of the lead five
Deliverable. So this one, Stranded take a back seat. And we focused
entirely on the TSA Bottoms Up.
Unknown7:28
Yeah.
Arit7:30
So that is the place wherein we. We got the good amount of data, but not in
the standard part. So Stranded is. That's why. That's the game plan.
That's. That is going to be part of the next gate Deliverable, the standard
one. Okay. What would be the approach? What are. What we think should be
the next Excel plan that needs to be finalized.
Unknown7:52
Yeah, because that's what Rakesh is asking me. Like, what's the game plan
for Stranded?
Arit7:59
Yeah. As of now. Yeah. So we had a detailed discussion around this with
Rakesh. What is. What. What we can. What. What we can do as an alternate
solution. Not rooted yet.
Unknown8:11
Okay. Let me noodle on this for a little bit. I've got a call now and then
I might ping you with some questions here in a little bit.
Arit8:22
Sure.
Unknown8:22
Thank you. Thank you so much. Arit.
Arit8:25
Thank you. Thanks.
Unknown8:26
Talk to you soon. Bye.

ether it&#39;s hardware or it&#39;s software. Then we have to identify from=
 ourselves that what would be the standard cost. I&#39;m just giving you a =
perception or I&#39;m just giving you a reference that suppose in and the h=
ardware which is which is end of Life probably in December 26th and the lic=
ense cost is supposed to be prepared till December 26. Then we have to find=
 out that that is part of the TSA or not or day one or not and then what ho=
w much cost is associated from day one or the TSA and date till the license=
 end date. Okay. Yes that exercise that needs to be but we were struggling =
with the data so we were struggling with the labor data. We&#39;re struggli=
ng with the the actual data with the format that we were looking for. Okay =
that is the. That is the chunk for this child it cost. Either we have to id=
entify any other way to do this maybe on the basis of any shared applicatio=
ns I&#39;m just giving a prospective yeah okay maybe maybe on the basis may=
be on the basis of any shared service which anyone has because they put it =
up as Athens build back or the movers applications to support. So that coul=
d be for example they have to add 200 employees to 200 resources to build b=
ack the. Are they really required for the or not? If not, then that could b=
e a standard cost. Could be for one month, could be for two months. There&#=
