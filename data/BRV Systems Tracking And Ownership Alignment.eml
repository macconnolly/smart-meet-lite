BRV Systems Tracking And Ownership Alignment

# Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 =
BRV Systems & Process Tracker Deep Dive

**Date:** June 2, 2025 =20
**Participants:** Project leads, IT and business function representatives, =
HR leads, UAT Coordinators, EY team members =20
**Primary Focus:** =
Alignment and tracking for BRV (Business Readiness Validation) across =
systems and processes in the context of major HR and Finance system =
transitions at Honeywell.

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. System & Process Tracker Nuances

#### A. Systems Involved and Their=
 Status
- **Key systems:** =20
  - **Old PeopleSoft** (previous HR system, =
now mainly used for payroll),
  - **Honeywell HCM** (newly launched HR =
system, not present in the standard list of 296 apps, to be added as 297),
  - **Celego Payroll** (outsource solution, new payroll provider).
- **System vs. Process Impact:**
  - Certain processes undergo significant =
change (e.g., legal entity structure in the US), but the underlying systems=
 may not be directly altered.
  - For these cases, only the process side =
needs validation/testing =E2=80=93 system-level UAT is unnecessary unless =
BRV-related.
  - These nuanced distinctions must be visualized in BRV =
tracking dashboards.

#### B. System and Process Mapping
- Emphasized **need for accurate linkage between processes and systems**:
  - Process dashboard to indicate which systems are leveraged (even if not =
directly changed).
  - Mapping must identify when a process touches a =
system that is unchanged yet still critical to process validation.

#### C. Data and Dashboard Management
- **Action to add Honeywell HCM as a =
new app entry (to become 297th system in tracker).**
- Recognized 'gaps' in the tracker due to missing newly built-back =
systems/clones.
- **Service owner** identification is vital =E2=80=93 each =
system must have a clearly named primary technical/service owner for =
accountability.
- The system-service owner mapping is **many-to-many** and =
requires careful inventory and validation (example: Steve Brown overseeing =
multiple apps).

#### D. Importance of Accurate Categorization
- All impacted systems/processes must be tagged:
  - **Outsource/Build =
Back/Move As Is:** Only exclude =E2=80=9Clive without,=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=9CTSA,=E2=80=9D or systems untouched.
  - The targeted =
=E2=80=9C82=E2=80=9D systems include more than just those directly tagged =
BRV.

---

### 2. Scheduling & Coordination

#### A. Setting Up Cadence =
Meetings (MOS)
- **MOS =3D Management Operating System** cadence meetings =
aimed at systematic cross-team alignment.
- Meetings will include IT focals=
, business functionals, HR leads, UAT coordinators, and relevant =
stakeholders from EY and PMO.
- Meetings to follow a structured agenda:
  1. Validate systems inventory with service owners.
  2. Cross-check process-to-system mapping.
  3. Review UAT/test calendars =
by system and function.
  4. Align and update trackers (Excel, Smartsheet, =
and ultimately Capital Edge).
  5. Confirm agenda items; follow-up after =
initial and subsequent meetings.

#### B. Calendar and Communication Action=
 Plan
- Half-hour connections to be scheduled **starting Wednesday, June 4,=
 2025** and running through the week and into the next.
  - Special attention to Supply Chain meetings (smaller on Wednesday, =
broader on Thursday, per Pierce=E2=80=99s email).
- Review and refine the =
meeting schedule, including business and IT leads, functional =
coordinators/POCs, UAT coordinators, and sub-function reps.
- **Two-week rolling calendar view** to be built for visibility and =
planning.

---

### 3. Tracker, Dashboard, and Inventory Management

#### A. Tracker Details
- **Excel tracker** for today's needs; move to =
Smartsheet tomorrow.
- **Smartsheet and Capital Edge**: Master data and =
source of truth for process-to-system mapping and inventory.
- Process: **Get input from function/IT leads to confirm service owners =
attached to systems**; create comprehensive mapping for reporting.

#### B. Dashboard Building / Data Modeling
- Need to review dashboards =
(potentially draw from 3M, GE, RTX, JJ templates) to illustrate:
  - System readiness heatmaps or charts.
  - Linkage of system/process test=
 completion.
- Share initial dashboard views with stakeholders, especially =
for the =E2=80=9C6.4=E2=80=9D (Wednesday) and upcoming =E2=80=9CSukai =
Readout=E2=80=9D (by June 6).

#### C. UAT and Test Calendar Integration
- Collate UAT windows/tests per system and function.
- Request all IT owners to share **detailed UAT/calendar windows** for =
their domain systems (e.g., ERP: 6/24-6/30 & 7/7-7/13).
- Input this into a master Gantt/calendar for cross-functional alignment.
- Anticipate adjusting test dates based on resource conflicts or =
dependencies.

---

### 4. Process-to-System Mapping and Ownership =
Alignment

- **Capital Edge** acts as the repository of structured mappings=
 between every function=E2=80=99s processes and the systems they touch.
- Each process is explicitly linked to the relevant system(s), sometimes =
resulting in multiple entries for the same system if touched by several =
processes.
- This enables robust tracking of UAT completeness and ensures =
all dependencies are clear.

- **Nuanced example:** =20
  - A system like SAP may appear 15 times=E2=80=94once for each =
process/subprocess/function that leverages it for BRV.

- **Recommendation:** =20
  - During MOS meetings, teams will review and =
validate the completeness and correctness of this mapping, including =
cross-functional and end-to-end processes (e.g., Record to Report, Order to=
 Cash, Procure to Pay).

---

### 5. Next Steps and Final Points

- **Immediate need for alignment with Justin on Smartsheet logic/tracker.**
- Meeting invites to go out after calendar finalization with clear agendas.
- Ongoing communication on tracker accessibility (e.g., resolving access =
issues for Capital Edge, obtaining offline copies as needed).
- **Email** to work stream leads planned for later that evening summarizing=
 UAT calendars/test windows and action expectations.
- Parallel syncs planned with key owners (e.g., Justin, Audrey, Jack) to =
resolve access and tracker issues.

---

## Action Items

1. **Finalize and circulate a new calendar** of cadence (MOS) meetings, =
including cross-functional meetings starting Wednesday, June 4.
2. **Validate and update system and process inventories** (Excel today; =
Smartsheet/Capital Edge tomorrow) with correct service owners.
3. **Add Honeywell HCM as a new system entry** in all trackers (App 297).
4. **Collate and document UAT/test windows** for all critical systems; =
request input from IT owners and integrate into master planning.
5. **Send out structured emails to all work stream leads** with meeting =
schedules, intended agenda, and expectations for input.
6. **Coordinate with Supply Chain Team**: Smaller group meeting Wednesday, =
broader audience Thursday.
7. **Prepare for Sukai Readout**: Refine =
=E2=80=9C6.4=E2=80=9D dashboard and materials.
8. **Sync with Justin and =
others** (e.g., Audrey, Jack) to resolve Smartsheet/Capital Edge tracker =
setup and access issues.
9. **Obtain/share offline copy of the BRV =
tracker** if Capital Edge access remains problematic.
10. **Develop/repurpose dashboard visuals** (sample from 3M/GE/JJ/etc.) for=
 ready use by Friday, June 6.
11. **Document service owner mapping** in new=
 tracker tab (Smartsheet/Excel) as per feedback from Steve Brown, et al.

---

## Follow-Up

- **Cadence meetings:** Function-by-function follow-ups =
after initial cross-functional alignment, with explicit notes and trackers =
updates. =20
- **Finance process mapping:** Use supplementary inputs from =
finance (e.g., detailed email view shared) to enrich tracker completeness.
- **Capital Edge access:** Confirm broader BRV and PMO module accessibility=
 for all relevant team members.
- **Readout Preparation:** Finalize and =
validate all tracker and dashboard outputs in advance of Sukai Readout (by =
June 6).

---

## Images

### Image 1: BRV UAT Owners Table (Finance =
Example)

**Key Elements:**
- **Process breakdown:** RTR (Record to Report)=
, OTC (Order to Cash), PTP (Procure to Pay).
- **Areas and Systems:** Each =
process is matched to specific sub-areas, with corresponding systems listed=
 (e.g., SAP, HCM, Blackline, BW, EDW, FDS, PowerBI, Workiva, Concur).
- **Finance Primary POCs:** Clear ownership assigned per area (e.g., Matt =
Tyburski, Juan Carlos Gomez, Chad Montgomery).
- **Visual Summary of =
Ownership:** Ensures that for every process/system interaction, a primary =
contact is identified for UAT readiness.
- **Use:** Reinforces the need for=
 explicit mapping and ownership in the trackers and dashboard tools being =
discussed.

**Significance:**
- The table illuminates the complexity and =
interconnectedness of systems with processes in finance.
- Visually depicts the need for detailed tracker mapping and confirms the =
ownership structure underpinning successful UAT and BRV outcomes.

Three systems that are getting=
 touched. The old PeopleSoft, the new Honeywell HCM, which is not there in =
the list of 296 because it just went live. And then there's a payroll, so =
which is a new payroll. Actually it's a Celego payroll and that's an =
outsource. So if we want to reflect these three, we have to understand how =
best to reflect them. And, and that indicate that these are apps getting =
touched one way or another and that we need to account for progress on them=
.

0:35
I think this way. Right. Like.

0:39
Well, this is different. So. =
Okay, so. But the list on the left is the same 20 odd.

0:45
Yeah, well those other ones should be in here. Like these three I would =
expect to be in here because although they're not brv, technically they =
should be accounted for within BRV because there's a BRV component to them,=
 like the process.

1:05
There's a process change and a component to them, =
but there are absolutely no system changes. So from a system perspective, =
there's nothing to test. It's purely from a process perspective that they =
need to test. So if I'm doing UAT on my systems tracker, I would not have =
these three because they're not BRV related. Got it. They're purely process=
 changes that are using these systems. Okay.

1:34
So that goes into the =
process dashboard.

1:36
That goes into a process dashboard. But then we =
have to link the systems to the processes and if we see some disconnect, =
that's where the rub is. So those are the kind of nuances we need to build =
into our tracker to say a process tracker is touching these 20 systems. But=
 three of these systems are not necessarily getting impacted. They're using=
 these systems because the process, they have to do a manual process in =
this system or they have to leverage this particular system and test and =
make sure that, you know, so imagine if you will, then the people in the US=
 are moving to new legal entities that is in the new Honeywell HCM system. =
But there is a feedback in there in the legal entity management system that=
 goes back and says make sure that the people are paid out of the, you know=
, payroll is coming for these new legal entities or people are paid out of =
the new right legal entity. And that payroll system is PeopleSoft. So those=
 kind of nuances will not be shown in a two by two system screen here. Yeah=
, so step one, we talked about the system tracker that is independent. Step=
 two here, if we're talking about the processes, then the conversations we =
need to have with all these functions about what are the systems you're =
touching. Let's say this system is in scope for brv. It needs to get tested=
.

3:04
I think these ones. So just to back up really quickly, these =
Charter ID ones, these are the one. These are the new versions of those =
apps, right? Like, because these are the like here. This one, the =
compensation one.

3:18
No, they're not. They're the old ones. They're =
actually old. So why is it marked as completed? Yeah, because it's, it's =
not. So it's an old one from first five. Yeah, we have to see what that is.=
 We have to talk to the HR team and see why Global Compensation was marked =
that way.

3:43
Because the charter is dash BRV and I want to know if =
that's.

3:47
There's no, there's no, there's no charter. That, that was a =
wrong charter they created. I think they deleted the charter. So even the =
one above, if you say HR brv, Justin will tell you this is the wrong =
charter. So if you filter by Charter id, hr, BRV or just Charter id, HR =
contains. Contains hr. Okay, fine. So you see two of them here, which is =
the ADP and Global Compensation. Global Compensation is probably very =
different. So the rest of them are probably, probably day one related =
learning. Da da da da da. Variable pay. So some of these are live without, =
some of them are outsourced. Global Compensation is a build back. So I =
think we just tagged something that we could say is a build back and used. =
So technically speaking we should add a new app ID called Honeywell HCM =
into this and use that as the right one so it should become 297.

4:55
That's the gap is the new build backs and clones are not represented only =
for.

5:04
Well, new clones and build backs will not be. So we have to use =
a proxy and do the old one. We just have to find the right old one then if =
it's not this. But the idea is that there'll be a couple of systems in play=
 and we need to work with Arpit on the HR side to do this or Sandra and you=
 know Sandra, the HR lead that's designated to do this.

5:27
Yeah.

5:28
And we need to document it and say this is what it's touching. Here's what =
we are doing for this and this is what we're going to be tracking and =
reporting on. Because once you're in Capital Edge there is a BRB tracker =
and readiness report that they do that says people process an inventory of =
systems that they have to report on and they were complaining that we've =
flagged the wrong two systems etc so there's a. There's probably a process =
needed to do that to clean that up on the flip side. So we need these =
meetings with every function to set up this cadence, this MOS we talk about=
. Let's, let's. So before we hang up today, we need to create a calendar =
view and send out notes to everyone or send out meeting invites for an mos.=
 Let's put people's, you know, we'll get the right, you know, the IT focal =
and the HR focal, and we'll include our EY team members and peers and we =
will talk through how we're going to manage this and how we're going to =
track it and what we're going to report on here so that, you know, again, =
that will be tomorrow, Wednesday. What's tomorrow? Wednesday. So tomorrow =
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and into next week. But we should set up these =
half an hour connects so that there's this conversation including the =
Wednesday supply chain. So please set that up Wednesday and Thursday.

6:58
Which one was that again?

6:59
Sorry, the forward email I forwarded you on=
 supply chain that Pierce said that. Hey, we'll set up a smaller =
conversation Wednesday and a broader on Thursday.

7:09
Got it. Okay.

7:10
If you recall. So. So these people on the IT lead as well as the business =
focal and the UAT coordinators all need to be. Forget the opsep lead. Those=
 are high level. But the other ones meaning high level, meaning they're the=
 work stream lead. They're probably not going to show up. But uat, business=
 focal and IT focal and sub function, those people need to be there in =
these conversations. So let's. So these three things.

7:37
What about the functional coordinator?

7:39
Yeah, the them as well.

7:41
So can we rename these to match that. That format from the slide that we =
had with.

7:50
So they're called. Yeah, yeah, Honeywell. So they're not =
necessarily. So they're different. So, so go back to that. They're truly =
functional coordinators and POCs and they're not necessarily function leads=
. So go back to the Excel so you can call them as functional coordinator. =
POC is fine. The business focal. Yeah, the business focal is so CCX is a =
weird example because these UAT functional coordinators and pa. Okay. Okay,=
 let's see how we can rework these. I wonder if. So we got these people =
from finance. Where do you get the other business vocal name? Juan Carlos =
and Cesar. Did somebody fill that?

9:12
Which one?

9:12
Or it might have been those ones in the finance space.

9:15
Yeah, somebody filled this.

9:16
Okay, maybe it might have been me. I'm =
trying to understand where we got that.

9:24
I Think it was.

9:26
I probably filled it up initially and seated it. Okay, so where we need to =
do what we need to do here, I'm just thinking through leave these as it is,=
 leave them as is for now and then you know, we can there people are going =
to fill and people are going to add other things. The other piece of this =
is obviously for systems we need a service owner. So for example, these IT =
focals, the other tracker we're going to need is obviously the system we're=
 looking at. And one of the, one of the bullet points in the system is a =
service owner. So you could have a service owner that services five or 10 =
IT systems. And so they will be, you know, the Steve Browns of the world =
will go in and say for CCEX, I got 30 apps or 50 apps and these are the =
service owners that service 5 of this, 3 of this, 10 of these, 7 of these. =
So. Or you know, individual service owners. So he's going to put those =
names in there because those service owners will be the ones responsible =
for the sit UAT along with the test leads.

10:34
Is he going to stick it =
in sub function, it PoC or in a new column?

10:39
No, it will be in a new =
tab because that's at a system inventory level, it's not at this. Right. So=
 this is a comment he had on that. The two red or the pink highlighted ones=
 where he says, you know, if you go all the way to the right, he said I =
need to understand the applications they serve. So this is the part where, =
you know, you can have. Because it's not a one to one between process and =
system, I could potentially have hopefully not. But if I have one service =
owner that serves these three systems that touch this process, then it =
would be sort of a many systems to one process and one service owner to one=
 process owner conversation. But if I have five different systems with two =
different service owners, then it's a many to many.

11:31
Yep.

11:32
So, so, but that's a separate. This goes back to the tracker. We're =
creating the system inventory where we need to add the service owner as =
well. Right. So it could be in the same smartsheets where we add a column =
that says service owner and, and not this, the smartsheets. But the other =
point again, I don't want to go all over the place. I want to stick to sort=
 of a regimented process here. So let's start calendaring. So let's step =
number one, bullet number one, we need to set up a conversation with each =
of those IT focals to get the names of the service owners, you know, where =
was the other snapshot? The other go to slide four. Okay. So even here =
system view dashboard. So set up conversation with each of the IT focals to=
 get the service owner for the inventory and that should go into that =
tracker. That should get reflected in the tracker and then we should also. =
Well, we provide data model to GDS to dashboard build. Okay, let's review =
that the review initial dashboard with peers. We should do that for 6.4 =
because we're there Wednesday. We need that. So we should tell, you know, =
Justin, we should talk about the build with Justin today and then let's, =
let's try getting a dashboard view, maybe reuse repurpose something that we=
 should see if, if GDS can help us on by tomorrow. So line item 2 should be=
 by tomorrow or maybe Monday. Wednesday our time.

13:35
This has to go tomorrow.

13:37
Yeah. So Wednesday morning India time would=
 be end of day for us. So we can come into Pierce on Wednesday afternoon =
and talk to it. The setup conversations with focals, that should also be a =
tomorrow conversation. Maybe it's a 15 minute call with each of the focal. =
So we need that inventory first and then we need to go after these. So =
again the tracker. So maybe it's an Excel tracker today and it goes into =
Smartsheets tomorrow. But we need that Excel tracker to you know a list of =
that 80 something apps and we go talk to the server who know talk to the =
focal to identify who the service owner is. Are.

14:29
Is the 80 something apps the ones that are tagged BRV?

14:34
No, they're also the non BRV ones. So they're anything that is a build back=
 move as is outsource there that is not TSA and not live without. So do =
build back move as is outsource? Yeah.

14:54
90.

14:56
Okay. So that is the one. If you take off outsource, they're probably 80 =
something.

15:01
Yep. 82.

15:10
Okay. So that 82 is that number you had =
earlier which is 22 plus 10 plus 50.

15:17
Yep, yep. So this is the list =
that we need the focals input on the system service service owner.

15:25
Yeah, yeah. We have to make sure that that list is accurate because if =
things are changing, this is step one, align with Justin that the TSA list =
is accurate, which I think it is. So if TSA is accurate, Live without is =
accurate and then the rest of this stuff is outsourced build back move as =
is.

16:01
Okay.

16:03
Okay. So let's talk about data model dashboard. So =
and we may have some sample dashboards that we can use from 3M and GE and =
RTX and JJ that we may have. So this sum there in terms of progression, =
that's essentially a heat map. Or not a heat map, but more of a chart that =
shows that. Let me see if there's something I can pull from JJ as an =
example that we can mock up. But we may have something similar from 3M&GE =
that would be great again for Friday if we mock up something like that, you=
 know, we can see how we can scale it. So that's everything in a Systems =
View dashboard. Anything else you think we should tackle here? Anything =
that comes to mind based on the conversations?

16:59
No.

16:59
And then we could say refine six four for, you know, for Sukai Readout by =
six. Six.

17:04
Yeah. Is that how you spell it? S U K A I. Yeah. Okay. And=
 then.

17:32
And this is in Capital Edge as well. So what they've done is =
for every process they've linked it. There's another tab in there that says=
 this function needs this system for this process id. So let's say, I don't=
 know, ERP is a good or bad example. ERP is needed by five functions across=
 100 process. 100 process. We would probably have a line item in the system=
, in the system tracker. There we probably have. When they're doing the =
mapping, they would map out erp, several line items of ERP to say the same =
thing. But say this function needs it against this process and this system.=
 So ERP could appear five times in that five rows.

18:24
In where the system.

18:25
Tracker in the process to system mapping.

18:29
Okay.

18:30
Yeah, the system tracker is what you just saw.

18:33
Yeah.

18:33
So the system tracker is taken from smartsheets and moved into=
 Capital Edge.

18:38
But we need a process. Yeah, we need a process to =
system mapping.

18:42
Right. Which they have done. And so what the =
conversations we should be having is that process to system mapping, =
because that's what we need, the alignment. So if supply chain says, I've =
got 10 processes as a whole with lots of sub processes, but 10 processes =
and they touch five systems. And by the way, you know, ERP is one of those =
systems, then I will say, say supply chain process X System, you know, is a=
 row that says this is a system X or system Y. If HR comes and says HR =
process A erp, that will be a second row for erp. If finance says, I've got=
 three processes, two of those processes touch erp. Then I'll have two line=
 items that says finance, two more rows that say Finance process M system =
ERP and Finance process N system erp. So that's how they're doing the =
mapping so that when they go in and they as in the process teams, they say,=
 I'm going to touch this system and I'm going to act on it. And there's a =
linkage there that says have I completed the tests on the the system? And =
if so, then the system is marked the. The activity and the system mapping =
is marked as complete. So that's the second piece where for process tracker=
 against the systems. This is the, this is a piece where it doesn't become =
22 anymore. It could become 22 plus some.

20:18
Yeah. So can I add that to=
 the it focal conversations. Review the process to see system mapping.

20:25
Which is the mos. Right, that's the MOS we need to set up. That's the=
 conversation we need to have on throughout these calendaring to say, hey, =
finance guy, I know you've got these systems you've called as BRV, but =
let's talk to the IT finance IT guy. You've got, you know, you look at our =
22, you've got finance seven or eight systems there. By the way, let's talk=
 to the finance function guy because he thinks he's touching more of your =
systems. They're in the scope of prv, but they're not changing for prv. So =
let's understand that they're touching those systems and they may need some=
 data for those systems or they may need to do some testing on the QA =
environment of those systems. So it's not you changing anything, but the =
process guys are going to touch your system. So. And this is when they're =
going to touch it. So that's the kind of conversation I want to have in =
these mos to get the business and IT alignment function by function and =
work stream by work stream to say, yep, these 22 systems in scope, great, I=
 have seven more systems I'm touching as part of BRV. Let's track them and =
note them and so that they are in a tracker somewhere that they've been =
touched and they've been tested.

21:46
Yep.

21:47
So that's the kind of conversation and the scope of the conversation we =
need for these calendarized Moses, these meetings.

21:57
Yes.

21:58
Right. So to do that though, I think we should start on Wednesday because I=
 think tomorrow is a bit harsh for us to set this up. But starting =
Wednesday and maybe with the supply chain, I want all of our stuff as a =
prerequisite done, meaning we've got the system inventory done, we've got =
this other Capital Edge tracker that has a tracking on, or if not Capital =
Edge somewhere in an Excel that says, maybe it's in the process tracker =
where we say these, or maybe it's a conversation with the function to say, =
say we're setting up this cadence we want to talk about. What systems do =
you think are touching, you know, the ERP system or this, this particular =
IT work stream. Let's talk through them, let's document them somewhere in a=
 centralized place so that you understand, you know, that it's all getting =
tracked. It will eventually be in the capital edge in that system process =
mapping, but we're tracking it, that there's a readiness to it, you know, =
if the system is not changing, do you need specific data? Do you need it to=
 be tested in a particular environment? What days are you going to be =
testing those? Because it's a process test. The functions are going to do =
that. And when it comes to systems, we'll certainly have the UAT windows.

23:17
Yeah.

23:19
So that's the kind of conversation I want with these =
agenda topics for each of these. Moses, when we send out these notes or if =
we, if the invites can go out in the morning. But I want, you know, I want =
this sort of like all structured and layered in to say, I'm going to hit =
these five points. I'm going to validate all the systems that we have seen.=
 So if you take, if you go back to the Excel workbook that you were showing=
 me about the systems and there's another tracker, so pre and the pmo. Oh =
yeah, that one. There's a cross functional mapping for uat. Right. So the =
third tab. So this was a preliminary view. So if you take a look at this, =
we can say IT and Finance are going to talk about, you know, Blackline and =
Hyperion and ERP and Workiva and perhaps a couple of others. So when we =
meet IT and Finance, so we'll have the Finance IT guy and the Finance =
Finance function guy when we talk. And the Finance function has all these =
sub functions, mind you. So we'll talk and they'll go, oh, I get it. I'm =
touching these four systems and by the way, I'm touching three of these =
outsourced systems or two more of these systems. And we can then go and say=
, oh, okay, this system is just a move as is, there's nothing happening. Or=
 this system is, there's no impact. Okay, you touch it, what do you need? =
This system is a build back. It's actually a day one. Let's look at, let's =
say, you know, this row number 15, okay, finance and it. Finance it. You're=
 touching the ERP okay, we know ERP is getting legal entity changes, and =
here's the ERP test window that we've already given. Yeah.

25:04
So legal should be checked here. And same with Black Line. It should have =
been checked.

25:08
Well, no, not legal. Legal entity is going to be =
different. Right. So. And yeah, Black Line is also an IT system, but it's =
fair enough. Right.

25:19
So in fact, all, like these are all of the, the,=
 this is that stakeholder. Like, we should be able to look at this and say =
these are the stakeholders who need to be in the room when we discuss SAP, =
ERP or Blackline.

25:32
Well, in a particular spot. Again, there are =
nuances to each of these. So Blackline, for example, IS, it's a SaaS =
application. They have rebuilt the structure and it's completed and it's =
done. So they're giving it by June to the function to go test processes. So=
 technically speaking, that work is complete and they would have completed =
stuff and it's done. The question now is, how do you, how do you account =
for it? So that's why it's not checked here, because, you know, the work is=
 sort of, it's, it's a SaaS application. It's, it's, it's oversight and =
then it's, it's given off to Finance to do process testing. So. But again, =
those sort of nuances you're not aware of. And so for your logic, yes, it =
should be ticked, but again, some of the intricacies involved. But this is =
the kind of conversation we need to have and kind of come in and say, =
listen, I've got 22 systems, I've got seven of these in Finance. What else =
are we missing? By the way, we should look at it from your process tracker.=
 You know, you've given us, and I think Finance has actually given us some =
numbers or some systems to say, these are the systems that are actually =
touching. And let me give that view to you, Athens, da da da da da. Give me=
 one second, I'll forward this to you. Mac. So you. So we have a view in =
Finance, so you can add this to the tracker. So the email I just sent you =
came from Finance, and Finance is very thorough. So you can see that all of=
 these systems are getting touched for brv. So, and you can see the owners,=
 and these are the owners we added in there. Right. So we need to include =
all these systems into the finance conversation or at least flag them as =
BRV impacted.

27:34
Yeah.

27:35
So we should look at it against a 22 and =
if not, we should add a few more, add all These ones that are in the email.

27:52
Rtr, otc, pp.

27:55
So these are record to report, order to cash =
and procure to pay. These are the end to end processes. So we have not =
talked about these. We should talk about them as well. So what's going to =
happen? If you think about it, and this is the whole process and what we're=
 trying to work out there will be perhaps finance only processes that are =
changing. And the BRV tracker identifies that and says, okay. The process =
tracker in the capital ED says, okay, these are the processes that are =
changing for function and it could be finance only. And they touch a system=
 and there's very simple things, testing of process and system. These ones =
for example are end to end processes that touch multiple processes and =
multiple, multiple functions and multiple systems. So in a record to report=
 you've got these four areas and they touch multiple systems the same. So =
SAP touched several times, you know, and you see, you know there are =
different people here for, you know, the POCs. And these are the POCs I =
took in and updated in that sheet. So you can see that ERP for a record to =
report is touched, order to cash, SAP is touched, procure to pay. Yeah, =
it's a different system. But these are the kind of mapping we need coming =
out in a tracker to say and this is what will go into that Capital Edge =
tracker where they go, okay, finance, it's touching this system SAP. They =
come back in and say otc, it's touching the same system SAP. So SAP will =
show up twice. Twice or three times because it's different processes that =
may be tested on different days.

29:40
Yeah, there's a couple ways I think=
 that we can represent this. Like I don't know if it's, it's not probably =
going to come from one place. Like if we're doing it in Smartsheet or we're=
 doing the setup of it in Smartsheet, there's a couple of ways you could =
architect it. But you would have like the systems and mark maybe the =
processes that are involved or. Yeah, go ahead.

30:04
Sorry. No, no, finish your thought.

30:06
I mean this to me is like, this =
reads like a summary view of some. I think you would have to join. Right. =
Like the process table and the system table.

30:19
We shouldn't. So this is being done in Capital Edge. So this, the data from=
 here will stay in Capital Edge. This is what I was talking mentioning =
earlier that there's a process tab and then there's a system mapping tab.

30:34
Got it.

30:34
So the finance team, or maybe it will have to go in =
and say with finance we can live edit perhaps where they go in and say I've=
 got this process ID in the process tracker. I'm going to need this system =
to be tested like they've mentioned in that Excel. So they'll go in and add=
 a row in that system tab that says process X sub process Y system Z and =
then they'll come back, there'll be a second row that says process A sub =
process B system Z because it's the same system touched by multiple sub =
processes or processes and different functions. So SAP will show up maybe =
15 times because six different functions touch it 15 times. So this is the =
conversation we need to have with them. And as part of that conversation we=
 should be have a takeaway that says we've identified the processes that =
touch the, we've identified the systems that get touched. We will map it =
against all the inventory to understand what's happening. So you know the =
scope of your UAT and our UAT and we will create the entry here in you know=
, the capital Edge where we need to align and document that. So the =
conversation again the outcomes should be IT business alignment. So the =
conversations for this mos with each function. So it should be IT and =
function and EY counterparts where needed as well as, you know, the other =
maybe the coordinators. And we need to discuss the systems impacted or =
systems changing systems touched by each process sub process. We need to =
discuss third bullet UAT calendars and we probably need to develop an end =
to end calendar view. So add this as an item. We should send out an email =
to everybody today. I can do that this evening to all the IT owners to say =
when are your calendars for your big ticket items? When are the test =
calendars for uat? So ERP has one CCX and supply chain may have another. So=
 we should, we should see if you know, there are some test calendars that =
they give. So we should take those test calendars, you know, put that as a =
gantt for example, and say supply chain calendar, these two weeks ERP =
calendar, you know, two windows of a week and a half and what they are. So =
that when we have the conversation with finance, Finance says oh okay, I =
need to use erp, but I have got the test calendar here. I need to use, you =
know, something else. But you know, I can't test it. You know, I may be =
able to test something with supply chain early on, but I have to wait till =
somewhere later to test ERP as an example. So those kind of inferences can =
come out of this conversation that will then then adjust Some of the test =
dates.

33:51
Do you want to send that email to folks or can you just =
assume that.

33:56
No, no assumption here that these are.

33:58
Correct and let them update as a part of the MLS cadence.

34:02
Yes and no, but we need to. We'll do both. I want them to send that part of=
 the conversation would be with them when we do the system inventory is. =
Give us the mo. Give us a calendar. Okay, you've given us a calendar. Is =
this right? If so, why does your system inventory tracker not give the =
right thing in your work plans? It's a hygiene issue. I'm going to change =
this. Are you okay with this? And then you know, we get their buy in.

34:31
Yeah.

34:32
And we action that and we say listen, you gave me a =
calendar. Your work plan doesn't.

34:37
For example, I'm, I'm, I'm totally=
 aligned with you except for the part of we, we will change this for you.

34:42
Like I think they can, they can go change it. The point is they can =
go change it. But ERP has a generic thing that says UAT 71 to 7 15. They =
haven't changed their work plans, but we know they've sent a calendar out =
that says I've got two windows a week here and a week there. So they've =
said, for example, they say 623 to 715 but we know that they've given a =
working calendar that says 624 to 630 and then 74 that week is off. Then =
they go 77 to 7 13. So now is it possible for them to change their work =
plans? Yes, but we have multiple cases like these. We have to see what it =
is. Right, but. So these are the kind of sequenced activities I want us to =
do in this mosquito. So we should send out the calendar tomorrow, but we =
should send out the, the invites tomorrow. What I want you to do is take a =
pass at you know, what meetings, you know, let's say meeting number one. =
Then there's a follow up meeting number two two days later. So we can do it=
 such that maybe Wednesday and Friday there's a follow up Wednesday =
meetings with you know, work stream A, B and C or function A, B and C. And =
then there's a follow up on Friday with the same A, B and C. And then we do=
 work streams D, E and F on Thursday there's a follow up next Monday with =
those same.

36:10
Yep.

36:12
So just give me a two week calendar view =
like that and we can review that and make edits and then send out the =
invites. So based on the, the owners and the Names we have, we can send out=
 those invites with the right agenda topic. So these agenda topics is =
everything on the right hand side where we'll say I want to do this, this, =
this, this and this in this conversation. And you know who else needs to be=
 there.

36:40
Yes.

36:42
And we can do that in half an hour call on a =
Wednesday if that's not complete, we follow up again on a Friday or =
somebody was missing and out of office. Then we have a follow up on Friday =
to get that. Because keep in mind the trackers and the dashboards need. The=
 dashboard for Jeff needs to be on the inventory level. The process =
dashboard needs to be with pre and the SMO level. That's also needed very =
quickly. Yeah, so I know I've kind of said a lot there, but hopefully, you =
know, we're aligned. You, you're, you're able to follow the order of things=
.

37:19
Yeah, I think we're, I think we're aligned. I need to sync with =
Justin tonight on the smart sheet. I need to do that meeting schedule =
combinations. Are you good to send out this one, the email to the work =
stream?

37:37
Yeah, I'll do the email. I'll do the email this evening. =
Okay. I, I've gotta, I'm gonna go log off and do some groceries and come =
back and I'll be online later this evening and send out.

37:47
Yeah, in like 15 minutes. I have to go pick up the dog.

37:50
Okay.

37:51
But I'll be back in just a little bit.

37:53
Okay.

37:54
And then.

37:55
Sounds good.

37:57
Yeah, I need to. Because I set up a call with Justin =
tomorrow morning, but I need to see if he's try.

38:03
See if you can ping him today. Ping him and Audrey, if you can. Can for =
quick 10 minute chat.

38:08
Okay, I'm gonna put you in this chat so they.

38:11
Okay.

38:16
Okay. So I'll sync with them. We'll figure out at least =
what we can do from Smartsheet. I think it will be really helpful to get =
that. The BRV readiness tracker from.

38:30
Yeah, from Capital Edge. Yeah.=
 So hopefully, hopefully Jack gets it sorted out and in the morning you =
have access, if not tonight.

38:40
Yeah, yeah, I think Justin had pinged =
him too, so he is definitely on it.

38:45
Okay.

38:46
I'm just surprised it's not in here. And that's one of the things I want to=
 ask Justin is like, is that readiness tracker in here? Because if it is, =
it won't be.

38:54
I think it's the other way around. It will be. This is =
a, this is smartsheet tracker. But it won't, it will have a sync into the =
other one. It won't be the other way around.

39:06
Yeah, okay. Okay, that makes sense. Do you?

39:12
And let me give you the =
link to Capital Edge so you can see. Once they give you access. Give me a =
second. Ess, ess, ess. Where is Capital Edge? Okay. Geez. I'm hoping that's=
 not the real link. Okay, I think it is. So. Oh, never mind. What did I =
give you? I might have given you some crap.

40:12
Let me try that one.

40:14
No, hold on. Edit. Yeah, I gave you. Let me. Okay. Weird. Okay, okay,=
 so I sent you the other link. So yeah, you've not been granted. So yeah, =
if Jack gets that sorted, you should get that access immediately.

40:44
Cool.

40:48
In fact, you know what? You should have access to the BRV =
tracker. It might be in. Let's see if I can get an offline copy for you. =
I'll send it to you.

41:00
Yeah, that would be great.

41:02
Yeah, let me do that this evening. In fact, let me do it now. BR V. Oh. Why=
 is this not Athens brv? Okay, so actually you need. Here, this is the =
Athens one. So you will actually get. Yeah, so there are multiple modules =
in there. One of them is a PMO module and the other one is the BRV module. =
So the BRV you should get access to. I should say. Let me just ping Jack. =
He'll need access to PMO and BRV modules. So yeah, so the brv. Let's see =
here. I'm just gonna share my screen and work it with you so I can get you =
that. Okay, interesting. Cheese. And. Okay, I don't have access to the PRV =
either.

42:55
Crazy.

42:56
Okay. Athens Project home. I've got access to =
the legal entity stuff, but yeah, I. Unless this is in development and not =
yet done.

43:12
Is it under pmo?

43:15
No, it's not. It won't =
notification. It's not in here. So you've got work plan interdependencies, =
but that's about it. So the work plan is a work plan. All of this other =
stuff that's in smart sheets. The milestones are moved in here. Yeah, but =
other things. The BRV tracker is probably what we need, but. Okay. Anyway, =
so that's not there. I'll try to get an offline copy of it from the folder =
and then send it over your way shortly.

43:49
Okay, that sounds great. =
Thank you, Rakesh.

43:52
Alrighty, sir.

43:53
Okay, yeah, I'll ping you =
in a little bit.

43:56
Yeah, no worries. Take your time. I should be =
online later tonight, so if you run into issues or have questions, I know =
you're mountain time, right?

44:03
Yep.

44:04
Okay, so I should still be =
online. Cool.

44:07
Okay, cool. Thank you so much.

 the one above, if you say HR brv, Justin will tell you this is the wrong =
charter. So if you filter by Charter id, hr, BRV or just Charter id, HR =

the ADP and Global Compensation. Global Compensation is probably very =
different. So the rest of them are probably, probably day one related =

some of them are outsourced. Global Compensation is a build back. So I =

.6">Right. Which they have done. And so what the conversations we should be=
 having is that process to system mapping, because that&#x27;s what we need=
, the alignment. So if supply chain says, I&#x27;ve got 10 processes as a =
whole with lots of sub processes, but 10 processes and they touch five =
systems. And by the way, you know, ERP is one of those systems, then I will=
 say, say supply chain process X System, you know, is a row that says this =
is a system X or system Y. If HR comes and says HR process A erp, that will=
 be a second row for erp. If finance says, I&#x27;ve got three processes, =
two of those processes touch erp. Then I&#x27;ll have two line items that =
says finance, two more rows that say Finance process M system ERP and =
Finance process N system erp. So that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re doing the =
mapping so that when they go in and they as in the process teams, they say,=
 I&#x27;m going to touch this system and I&#x27;m going to act on it. And =
there&#x27;s a linkage there that says have I completed the tests on the =
the system? And if so, then the system is marked the. The activity and the =
system mapping is marked as complete. So that&#x27;s the second piece where=
 for process tracker against the systems. This is the, this is a piece =
where it doesn&#x27;t become 22 anymore. It could become 22 plus some.=

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Well, in a =
particular spot. Again, there are nuances to each of these. So Blackline, =
for example, IS, it&#x27;s a SaaS application. They have rebuilt the =
structure and it&#x27;s completed and it&#x27;s done. So they&#x27;re =
giving it by June to the function to go test processes. So technically =
speaking, that work is complete and they would have completed stuff and =
it&#x27;s done. The question now is, how do you, how do you account for it?=
 So that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not checked here, because, you know, the work=
 is sort of, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a SaaS application. It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s,=
 it&#x27;s oversight and then it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s given off to Finance to =
do process testing. So. But again, those sort of nuances you&#x27;re not =
aware of. And so for your logic, yes, it should be ticked, but again, some =
of the intricacies involved. But this is the kind of conversation we need =
to have and kind of come in and say, listen, I&#x27;ve got 22 systems, =
I&#x27;ve got seven of these in Finance. What else are we missing? By the =
way, we should look at it from your process tracker. You know, you&#x27;ve =
given us, and I think Finance has actually given us some numbers or some =
systems to say, these are the systems that are actually touching. And let =
me give that view to you, Athens, da da da da da. Give me one second, =
I&#x27;ll forward this to you. Mac. So you. So we have a view in Finance, =
so you can add this to the tracker. So the email I just sent you came from =
Finance, and Finance is very thorough. So you can see that all of these =
systems are getting touched for brv. So, and you can see the owners, and =
these are the owners we added in there. Right. So we need to include all =
these systems into the finance conversation or at least flag them as BRV =
impacted.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgrou=

the whole process and what we&#x27;re trying to work out there will be =
perhaps finance only processes that are changing. And the BRV tracker =
identifies that and says, okay. The process tracker in the capital ED says,=
 okay, these are the processes that are changing for function and it could =
be finance only. And they touch a system and there&#x27;s very simple =
things, testing of process and system. These ones for example are end to =
end processes that touch multiple processes and multiple, multiple =
functions and multiple systems. So in a record to report you&#x27;ve got =
these four areas and they touch multiple systems the same. So SAP touched =
several times, you know, and you see, you know there are different people =
here for, you know, the POCs. And these are the POCs I took in and updated =

perhaps where they go in and say I&#x27;ve got this process ID in the =

they&#x27;ve mentioned in that Excel. So they&#x27;ll go in and add a row =

they&#x27;ll come back, there&#x27;ll be a second row that says process A =
sub process B system Z because it&#x27;s the same system touched by =
multiple sub processes or processes and different functions. So SAP will =
show up maybe 15 times because six different functions touch it 15 times. =
So this is the conversation we need to have with them. And as part of that =
conversation we should be have a takeaway that says we&#x27;ve identified =
the processes that touch the, we&#x27;ve identified the systems that get =
touched. We will map it against all the inventory to understand what&#x27;s=
 happening. So you know the scope of your UAT and our UAT and we will =
create the entry here in you know, the capital Edge where we need to align =
and document that. So the conversation again the outcomes should be IT =
business alignment. So the conversations for this mos with each function. =
So it should be IT and function and EY counterparts where needed as well as=
, you know, the other maybe the coordinators. And we need to discuss the =
systems impacted or systems changing systems touched by each process sub =
process. We need to discuss third bullet UAT calendars and we probably need=
 to develop an end to end calendar view. So add this as an item. We should =
send out an email to everybody today. I can do that this evening to all the=
 IT owners to say when are your calendars for your big ticket items? When =
are the test calendars for uat? So ERP has one CCX and supply chain may =
have another. So we should, we should see if you know, there are some test =
calendars that they give. So we should take those test calendars, you know,=
 put that as a gantt for example, and say supply chain calendar, these two =
weeks ERP calendar, you know, two windows of a week and a half and what =
they are. So that when we have the conversation with finance, Finance says =
oh okay, I need to use erp, but I have got the test calendar here. I need =
to use, you know, something else. But you know, I can&#x27;t test it. You =
know, I may be able to test something with supply chain early on, but I =
have to wait till somewhere later to test ERP as an example. So those kind =
of inferences can come out of this conversation that will then then adjust =
Some of the test dates.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding=

calendar out that says I&#x27;ve got two windows a week here and a week =

that they&#x27;ve given a working calendar that says 624 to 630 and then 74=
 that week is off. Then they go 77 to 7 13. So now is it possible for them =
to change their work plans? Yes, but we have multiple cases like these. We =
