Meeting SummaryDate & Time

   - No explicit meeting date given; references to upcoming key events
   (e.g., next workshop in June, DAX DCN workshop held from April 28=E2=80=
=9330)
   - Multiple references to time zones and key deliverables due "end of
   day" (EOD) and "tomorrow morning"

------------------------------
Attendees

   - Multiple named participants: Arpit, Elaine, Justin, Corey, Stephen,
   Gary, Doris, Sean Davis, David Speckle, Aaron Hicks, Jeff, Michael
   Nobodney, Matt, Rajesh, Ravi Shankar, Wiki, Kieran, Sukai
   - Presence of IT, HR, Legal, HSE, and business function representatives

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Data Collection, Clean-up, and ValidationSummary

   - Critical emphasis on data accuracy and readiness before presenting to
   leadership, especially regarding mitigation for delays.
   - Ongoing process to collect and clean data for current project status,
   requiring communication across multiple teams and stakeholders.
   - Updates to CCX (Customer Care Experience), DCM (Data Center
   Management), TSA (Transition Services Agreement) bottoms-up models,
   heatmaps, and standalone cost models.
   - Need to create clear documentation and status (e.g., color-coded) to
   distinguish items potentially removed from scope or transitioned to
   standalone builds.
   - Recent data shows updated numbers of applications in scope (dropped
   from 103 to 94); corresponding impacts on disposition tracking and rebui=
ld
   ("build back") implications are being mapped.
   - Highlighted criticality of tracking, receiving, and integrating
   missing data, especially from BCN and DCN teams, and aligning with
   financial models (e.g., alignment with the $50=E2=80=9360M "non-personne=
l" cost
   estimates).

Key Points

   - Several teams (e.g., DCN, CCX, Data Intelligence) are delayed in
   delivering hosting, license, and cost data.
   - Need to distinguish TSA operational costs versus standalone costs and
   ensure alignment in reporting to leadership.
   - Ongoing internal audit of communications with engineering, legal, HR,
   and HSE to determine documentation completeness.
   - Emphasis on providing full total cost of ownership (TCO) data for all
   ~300 apps in scope=E2=80=94not just TSA apps=E2=80=94to enable further f=
iltering/modeling.

2. TSA and Standalone Cost ModelingSummary

   - Lively debate and clarification around which costs belong to TSA-run
   operations versus Day-1 Standalone environments.
   - TSA costs currently include depreciation, contingency, short-term
   services (e.g., HR), and application run costs. Updates to TSAs (e.g.,
   addition of apps, removal of others) require continuous updates to cost
   models.
   - Build back applications must move from TSA cost to Standalone cost
   tracking as they are repatriated to Athens' architecture.
   - Discussion about identifying components missing for both TSA and
   Standalone views, notably for application hosting and infrastructure cos=
ts,
   particularly from DCN and other teams.
   - Ensuring that any additions or removals of apps in TSA/Standalone
   lists have downstream effects mapped in both financial and architectural
   documentation.

Key Points

   - Contingency for TSA dropped from $3.2M to $300k post-Gate 3 review.
   - Clear need to add contract and service costs for newly identified TSAs
   (e.g., decks, HR).
   - The importance of breaking down cost components: infrastructure,
   software, licensing, support, hardware, and distinguishing internal vs.
   external labor.
   - Some data (e.g., from HR team) may be based on shorter durations (2
   months vs. minimum program standard of 3 months); costing models must be
   adapted accordingly.

3. Communication and Data GapsSummary

   - Teams are pursuing outstanding data from relevant teams (e.g., DCN for
   hosting costs, Data Intelligence).
   - Explicit actions to forward communication transcripts, invitations,
   and summaries to appropriate stakeholders (e.g., copying participants on
   emails to clarify deliverables and expectations).
   - Noted lack of documentation for certain streams (e.g., data
   engineering, data intelligence) and ongoing efforts to fill these
   documentation gaps.

Key Points

   - Requests for master sheets, TCO tables, and cost breakdowns for all
   applications (~300) to be submitted to the CMDB/hosting team.
   - Open coordination with IT stakeholders (e.g., sUraGe, others) to
   clarify and expedite expectations around TCO, including application,
   server, and database level granularity.
   - Ongoing communications with key program leads to ensure all relevant
   conversations are captured and followed up.

4. Workshops and Roadmap AlignmentSummary

   - Recap of recent DAX DCN Workshop (April 28=E2=80=9330), with 70+ parti=
cipants
   across key service towers.
   - Next similar workshop planned for June.
   - Productive outcomes highlighted: consolidation of SOWs, decisions on
   Active Directory trusts, ServiceNow transition timelines.
   - Infrastructure, PC refresh, and device management being actively
   tracked, with goals to eliminate technical debt for Day-1 support
   transition.
   - Emphasis on operational readiness for migration of 2,200+ PCs before
   October and ensuring key tenants (Intune, M365, MDM) are stood up by Jul=
y 1.

Key Points

   - Focus on seamless transition for Solstice business, minimizing
   technical and organizational risk.
   - Ongoing work to refresh/replace aged or underperforming PCs and to
   submit refresh orders.
   - Goal is 100% tech debt removal for smooth support transition.
   - Questions welcomed around the consolidated timeline, milestones, and
   deliverables, especially regarding infrastructure standup critical for
   Day-1 execution.

------------------------------
Action ItemsData/Modeling

   - Update and circulate heatmap and status sheets with current data by
   EOD/tomorrow morning.
   - Highlight and color-code apps potentially removed from existing lists
   for clear tracking.
   - Connect with Justin and others to populate latest inventory and update
   all sheets today.
   - Forward all communications and data requests to relevant external and
   internal stakeholders (e.g., sUraGe for TCO of all 300+ apps).
   - Prepare and communicate tables reflecting TCO by application,
   including missing cost elements (hardware, software, hosting/support).
   - Chase BCN, DCN, CCX, Data Intelligence teams for missing
   cost/hosting/licensing data.
   - Update HR TSA cost model to reflect at least a 3-month term or cost on
   a monthly basis, as per program requirements.
   - Forward relevant invites and documentation for legal, engineering, and
   other missing streams.

Workshops/Events

   - Follow up on upcoming collaborative workshop scheduled for June.
   - Ensure slides and summaries from previous workshops (e.g., DAX DCN
   April 28=E2=80=9330) are shared with stakeholders.

Stakeholder Coordination

   - Loop in Kieran, Gary, and other key contacts on missing engineering
   and data intelligence items.
   - Keep relevant parties copied on all key external communications and
   requests for transparency.

------------------------------
Follow-up

   - Confirm receipt and completeness of data from all streams (especially
   BCN, DCN, CCX, Data Intelligence) within the next day.
   - Review with finance and program leads to validate alignment between
   TSA/Standalone cost models and original Gate 3/4 non-personnel cost
   projections.
   - Schedule and document follow-up meetings or calls (e.g., with CCX at
   11:30, others as required).
   - Provide periodic updates on the progress and gaps for leadership
   visibility, particularly regarding readiness for key upcoming milestones
   (e.g., July 1 standup, PC migrations by October).
   - Continue to monitor and report on tech debt removal progress and
   PC/device refresh implementation.

Pre0:00
Without data, her particularly, she is very, very sharp. I mean, goes
without saying. But she's also very, you know, astute in picking up things
and saying, have you done enough before you come back to me, don't just cry
wolf, you know, do your be thorough, clean this up and then tell me what's
truly delayed and what your mitigation is. So I want to make sure that
anything we present to her we can stand behind.
Jeff0:32
Definitely. We do have the. Yeah, we do have the relevant communications
details with us.
Pre0:40
Okay.
Jeff0:42
Okay, so I'll update it. So the only thing is that they suggested that
they'll share the data except the cca. They said that they'll share it back
to the end of the day. So tomorrow morning by my time, I can share the
latest with the CCA that I'm going to attend. That's fine. But for the data
intelligence and the dcm either we have to wait it for tomorrow morning. So
today, end of the day your or tomorrow morning my time to share. Give you
the latest on the heat map. What is the current on the heat map? I can
share with you. That is with the basis of the facts that you have.
Pre1:16
Okay. It would be good to get today's view right now. Additionally, can we
look at the model. Can we look at the. The one time. Not the one time. The.
The tsa. The TSA Bottoms up model. Okay, so a few things. We've got the TSA
model. Just going to write this down again. I'm off screen. I'm just
writing on the whiteboard here in the room.
Jeff1:52
So this is the heat map I have to update about the. Today's. About the CCX
and rest of the. Where we chase them. Okay, I'll do it in. Are you able to
see my screen?
Pre2:04
Yes, I am, I am. I'm back in.
Jeff2:07
So this is the heat map again, part of the same. And then this is the
snapshot of the data that you have. It will segregate it.
Pre2:24
So it's anything in business scope. Okay.
Jeff2:28
This is.
Pre2:30
No. So keep in mind I know this is all work in progress thing, but you saw
Elaine talk about and Justin talk about apps coming out. We need to make
sure that there's this maybe color coded differently, something else that
says this is potentially removed. So you've got 103 in here. I think that
number went down. No, no, no, it went down by 10.
Jeff3:04
It's 94. The single number. Just a second. Yeah, this is on the
dispositions.
Pre3:10
Yeah. So those dispositions as they get firmed up would need to get
reflected here and they'll probably come off of here and we need to see if
they're all going to be build back etc. They'll go into the standalone
numbers. So we just need to do that. Connect the dots, color code, these
whatever those 10 rows or 12 rows here to say potentially removed and will
go into standalone. What's the implication of a build back?
Jeff3:38
Agreed. So I just take out the data.
Aaron Hicks3:41
From.
Jeff3:43
Just in all the master apps.
Pre3:45
Okay.
Jeff3:46
Yeah, so I'll highlight them today. So I just connected with so 13th part.
I connected with Justin on the latest inventory too. So I'll update them in
the sheet today.
Pre3:57
Okay, understood. So no, the question in the room here on build back. So
essentially you're building back the application in the Honeywell
architecture or landscape for Athens before day one. So it's going to be
run cost. So you're going to have to incur run cost on it. So it'll be go
into a day one standalone view.
Jeff4:19
Okay.
Pre4:20
So it won't be, they won't be billing it through TSAs. The TSA cost run
cost will go away but Athens will incur a run cost to operate it on day
one. So. All right, so.
Jeff4:36
This is the one standalone you're talking about. But yeah, again we do have
highlighted that we haven't got the data when we are chasing them where we
are.
Pre4:48
So I want to make sure. I also want us to tie this back into arpit. Some of
the, if you look at the standalone components in Gate 3 and Gate 4, not
much in Gate 4 but Gate 3, you know, the buildup of the standalone had what
they called OEF and non OEF essentially FTEs which are called OEFs or you
know, organizational effectiveness and then you know, the non resource
component of it. So that non resource I think was around 50 odd million. So
we just need to make sure that you know, what we're tracking to here lines
up or is in close. You know there's an order of magnitude relation with
that 50 plus or 60 million that came out of that non, non personnel cost
for standalone. Does that include services?
Jeff5:45
Yes, this is, this is the gate 3 cost difference too. For the standalone,
yes.
Pre5:52
Huh. Okay.
Jeff5:56
Yeah.
Pre5:57
So 50, 22 plus. Sorry for 12 months. It doesn't matter for 12 months gate
three. Okay, I get the point. But sorry, this seems to be a view from the
tsa. Not TSA run and not a standalone. Standalone. Day one is not this.
This is TSA run.
Jeff6:31
I'll double check. But this is the standalone model.
Pre6:36
No, can you. Yeah. This is not standalone model because you would have a
monthly cost at that point. There's no need to do a monthly cost on a
standalone. It's a yearly basis on day one. So I'm not sure. Okay, go to
the right. So gate three summary was these seem like. No, no, go to the
right of this tab. Okay, okay, that's fine. I mean we can look at the
reference a bit later, but let's look at the. Whatever tab you had. If you
go to the right.
Jeff7:13
Just assume there's this TSA cost. Agreed.
Pre7:15
Okay. So TSA was 12 months annualized, 32 million because it had
depreciation, it had.
Jeff7:21
Had.
Pre7:23
Contingency and it had other things. I think the whole premise was we don't
know what's going to happen to the depreciation. Right now we're carrying
10 million. That's going to come down Based on discussions, some of that
will become stranded if the 10 million cannot fully go to Athens. There was
conversation that we're going to add contracts and services here because
Those are new TSAs we need to it call, cost them out. There are
conversations that we removed the contingency because there was a, you
know, the three not removed. It went down from 3.2 million to 300k because
we had a cut after gate three on TSA costs. But this is all TSA cost. It's.
And then we're adding decks and HR as services short term tsa. So yeah,
this is all tsa. This is not standalone. So I think you should.
Jeff8:17
HR is added. HR is added here. Okay. Contract services that needs to be
added. Okay.
Pre8:24
Okay, so let's move to the right or let's go to the other tabs and see
where standalone. So my point though earlier point still stands. It will
come out of the TSA cost here and it'll go into standalone. So we just need
to make sure we capture that.
Jeff8:43
Let me pull out this standalone. Yeah, this is the one oem and all oem here=
.
Aaron Hicks9:14
About 12,000.
Jeff9:15
Correct. This is the gate three.
Pre9:18
Yeah, 50 and you'll have oef and non oef. And we've come down to a
contingency. The resulting number is actually post. Gate three go up. Yeah.
So gate. Okay, so this is an old one, but post this. We have removed some
numbers in the contingency. So actually no, gate three is fine. We didn't
remove the standalone, but the idea was there's a bottoms up build required
here based on what's actually coming and we need to get those numbers as
well.
Jeff9:52
Yeah, that is Something to be achieving. So we got the data from the hrr,
we got the data from the dch, sorry, from the text from the erp. But bcn,
we are chasing them.
Pre10:03
Okay.
Jeff10:04
Yeah, so, so this is the one that we differentiated in the license and the
internal and external labor cost.
Pre10:12
The erp, we've always. Erp, we've always had it since gate one. I think we
just need to add some additional assumptions.
Jeff10:22
BCN is the one which is missing, which is something that we are going to
connect with than for the VC in.
Pre10:31
I need to know what's missing. Right? I mean I need a view of what's
missing so we can target these conversations and arpit. That's kind of what
I was getting to earlier because after our conversation earlier, I think I
was left with the impression that all of the data in the model needed to
effectively be cleared.
Jeff10:55
And this is the latest that we received.
Pre11:00
Okay.
Jeff11:01
Ctx, dsa, that's already five applications. We haven't received any of
them. So we are going to connect with them today. Okay. Same goes with data
and intelligence. Dcn, we don't have data. This is the update and I have to
only update the comment for today. For example, for CCX and the DCN and the
data intelligence.
Pre11:27
Okay, what are we getting from the DCN team? I get what we're missing, but
what are we missing? Like what is it? We're looking at it from the DCN tab
that is incorrect or incomplete. Hosting costs. So hosting cost for. So if
you go to the DCN tab or from standalone. Right. So you're looking at,
you're looking at TSA or standalone.
Jeff11:53
So both standalone. Okay, okay. And, and for the DCN and standalone plus
tsa both. So only the only. So we are focusing on this TSA first.
Pre12:06
Okay.
Jeff12:07
And then if there's no TSA cost associated, we are looking for the build
back, we are looking for the standard.
Pre12:12
But so I mean that would be both. Yeah, while we're having those
conversations, we should be having both. No, they're. They're separate
conversations. We've had both. But I think the focus is on one, then they
provide the other. What TSA and then. Yeah, but they do need both. Right.
Because anything that's tsa, the infrastructure hosting these guys will
need to provide. I think the question is do they understand, do they
understand what they need to provide? I mean we've had the conversations. I
think hi Doris or whoever it is. Right. They know what they need to give us=
.
Jeff12:47
I think they are, I think they are because Ollie has clearly explained in
the email to that even he explained that what filter needs to be applied to
to identify the data that they are looking for. Okay, I think they are. And
what I'm asking with them if they need any help and if I can jump on any
other call, I can do that. Okay, that's what I'm asking for.
Pre13:07
Do they have data from. So the information that the guys provided from
cmdb, is that only for applications or is that also for databases?
Jeff13:19
I guess that is only for the applications.
Pre13:22
Okay, but the application. So my point though is. Or where I'm thinking, my
assumptions here are that when they provide a total cost of ownership, the
total cost of ownership would have application support and maintenance,
infrastructure hosting, licensing and any.
Jeff13:52
Sorry to interrupt you. So if you look at here, okay, so for the
standalone, we divide it like this. What are the internal, external
hardware and the software? Okay, this is, this is purely for the
standalone. If you looked at that, if you looked at this, this is purely
for the standalone.
Pre14:13
I'm talking what do you get from the CM sewerage and those guys that gave
you the total cost of ownership numbers from the cmd? My assumption is that
they gave these components of app support, maintenance, infrastructure,
hosting, licensing. It comes in the total cost of ownership, is that not.
Jeff14:39
I'll just open it. Yeah, OEF cost. Okay, the license cost. Okay, this is
the data that we received from the team, the TCO basically.
Pre14:55
And then is there anything on infrastructure hosting.
Jeff15:01
Purely on the line? I don't see anything on the stakes of it.
Pre15:06
Sure, I mean there should be. If I say total cost of ownership to run it,
it's hardware, software, license, support, support. So you have to support
as internal and outsource. So if they do an NTT or an LTI or tcs, that's
one. If they've got some fractional FTE supporting internally, like eight
hours a month, great, that's there. But then we should also get a view of
it's a million dollars to, you know, to host this in and maybe it's not at
an app level. That's what I'm trying to find out is let's say an
application has an app server, a database server and its infrastructure
hosting a network. I would expect the total cost of ownership, maybe not at
that level, but to say, okay, in this data center, it's costing us a
million bucks to run 500 servers and then we should be able to associate
that out of those 500 servers there are 220 servers that are related to
the. These 300 apps as an example. So that's the way I'm thinking that we
can parse out this data. But I cannot make that connection yet.
Jeff16:20
It has the license pass and the resource cost. Most of them I can see are
the SaaS based or the subscription based. So that could be the reason of
having the license cost only.
Pre16:33
Understood. And is this just for the 98 applications or is this for
everything?
Jeff16:39
No, this is just for the MIT applications, not for basically 74
applications.
Pre16:47
Why did we ask them for everything? The 290? The ask to them was we really
need total cost of ownership for all 300 apps in scope.
Jeff17:04
I need to check, but I think this is the only data that they provided. I'll
check the master sheet.
Pre17:10
I mean that's what you need to do standalone, right? Some of it you will
need for standalone. Because if they're not on a tsa, if they're on tsa,
the expectation is that Honeywell will charge Athens whatever the cost
they're incurring. A plus, B plus, C plus, D plus will just be a pass
through to Athens. And so we would need that value. But my point is like
we've added two apps to a TSA list, we've removed eight or 10. So we really
needed the total cost because now we're going to reach back out to them and
say, I don't have the value for these two new apps. Let me go. Give it to
me. So the ask of them was always that sewerage guy and the others was give
me for the 300 apps in scope in Athens, just give me what you have in the
CMDB. We can filter the 98 or the 92 or the 94 to get a view and build our
model, but we should get a total TCO from them of everything that's in
Scope for Athens. Naturally, 100 of them are live without, so they're not
going to. We don't need it, but we should get it. 50 of them are a build
back. So technically speaking there may be some components here we can take
out of it, but new licensing or new support we should be able to get from
Athens. Some of them are move as is. So we should be able to see what sort
of support is there and if there's a comparable thing that Athens is doing
or at least the hosting will be the same. So I think that's where I was
looking to get this information and right now I still don't know what's
missing.
Jeff18:45
So the data that we received it, that is basically the TSA applications
from the DCO point of view. Okay. That is something I don't see that has a
license. Plus internal and internal labor cost.
Pre18:56
Okay.
Jeff18:57
And mostly on the SaaS based application so I could see anything related to
the hardware or the server cost associated with it.
Pre19:04
So can I get a table of that? Can we request sewerage to get the can you
request sewerage for the other 200 apps that are in scope? Let's give him
the list of the 309th, 300+ apps in scope and say we've gone for 98, we
need this for the others.
Jeff19:22
Done.
Pre19:24
Please get with them as soon as you can. Maybe tomorrow morning your time
to see if you can pull that. Because I'd like that as a starting point to
say we've got everything in scope now. Let's use it the way we want. Okay.
So that's okay.
Jeff19:41
Could be the reason that we were only focusing on the TSM bottoms up
approach and that is the reason that we only ask for the TSA data. That's
my presence.
Pre19:50
No, Corey and I had a conversation on this like 3 weeks ago and said ask
for the 98 plus ask everything else because we need a view of the build
backs that we can get a view of our proxy based on this. So Corey's aware
of the ask for all 300 but again it's what it is. So this is my challenge
is I don't know what we don't know and I can't go to Sukai and say I've got
40% complete or 70% incomplete because my challenge is I don't know how to
interpret the data we have. All right, again that's a sidebar. That's my
problem now. But let's talk about what else is missing in the so what else
do we need in the one time costs. Sorry. In the, in the TSA run, TSA costs.
So we're talking CCX today. We're talking data analytics.
Jeff20:45
Yeah, we're talking about this and we're talking about dcn.
Pre20:48
Okay. DCN and CCX and data and analytics. Okay.
Jeff20:52
Yeah.
Pre20:53
Okay.
Jeff20:53
The dcn, I changed them today. I'm hoping we get that. But yeah.
Pre21:02
And CCX positions we are going to.
Jeff21:06
Meet up with in next one hour. We do have a call with them I guess 11:30.
Pre21:13
Okay. Okay.
Jeff21:19
So that's why I asked with them that we can share the data. But this guy
Stephen. Stephen, Stephen said that we will connect in the call and then we
discuss us. I, I, I text him back to that. If you have the data we can
analyze it can find out, but is that. That we are going to connect at 11:30
and let's discuss with them.
Pre21:45
Okay.
Jeff21:46
Okay, coming, coming back. Next item, let's. Do you have the communication
that is being done with the G on engineering.
Pre21:59
Data? On what?
Jeff22:02
So do you have the communication or any email material that was going on
that was going on with Gary on engineering or the standalone? No, I'm just.
Pre22:13
Is that from. Coming from Corey?
Jeff22:16
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to find out.
Pre22:19
Okay.
Jeff22:20
If I can choose Gary on this. If I can connect with Gary. But I don't see
anything on communication.
Pre22:33
There's legal. Do you have legal?
Jeff22:39
I do have Legal.
Pre22:40
Okay, that's true.
Jeff22:41
I jailed them up there.
Pre22:42
Sean Davis. Hse.
Jeff22:46
Hse. I have David. David Speckle. I have.
Pre22:49
Okay.
Jeff22:53
Legal. I think I do have Legal. Yeah, I do have.
Pre23:05
Okay, I don't see anything for. I see data and intelligence. I don't see
anything else. Engineering. Okay, there's a 519 that he had with Gary, but
outside that, Kieran and so it was five. 19 was the last one they had a
conversation on. So let me forward this.
Jeff23:30
Can you please forward me that?
Pre23:31
It's not an email. It's. It's not a.
Jeff23:34
It's a team's invite.
Pre23:35
It's an invite.
Jeff23:38
Okay. Can I have the email ID of.
Pre23:40
Yeah, yeah. Tier on.
Jeff23:44
Is it something that's gaddy handy, correct?
Pre23:48
Yes. Give me a second. I'm just typing up something here. Actually, Doris
is probably so discuss Karen including you in the document. Okay, so I'm
just going to say following up on the ask for Bottoms up costing. And it's
standalone, correct?
Jeff24:22
Yeah, the standalone.
Pre24:24
Okay.
Jeff24:28
Do you have any communication with the data intelligence? Two things I'm
not able to follow. One is the data engineering and second one is the data
and intelligence. And data intelligence is for both for the TSA and for the
standalone.
Pre24:45
Okay. Okay, I just copied you on that data and intelligence. Rajesh. Yeah,
there's a, there's a this thing here, so. Okay. Ravi Shankar, Arpit Ashram.
Give me a second. Okay, We're a bit over time, so I do have to drop off for
the next call, but I am sending the note. So for data and intelligence,
you're looking for TSA and standalone. Okay, I just sent you both.
Jeff27:22
Okay. Regarding the TSA document.
Pre27:27
Yes.
Jeff27:29
Okay, so I spoke to Wiki and he said that DSA duration is 12 months. So I
asked with him that if the applications are going to be ended in six to
nine months, what else is pending? What else is going to be pending for the
cyber for the PSA duration to be 12 months. But yeah, I'm just waiting for
a response. But yeah, okay.
Pre27:53
Yeah, so some of it was site related but the sites are moving most of the
app related and infra related. I think there was an ask that Athens may be
off in the six months but if there's some security posture they need to
maintain, then they need to have it for 12 months. But my, my challenge
there is like we, yeah, we need to get an answer from him on. It generally
has. It's. We understand it's the longest poll, but we just need to
understand what the components are.
Jeff28:21
So.
Pre28:22
Cool.
Jeff28:22
Yeah.
Aaron Hicks28:23
So all right.
Jeff28:23
Okay. So for the, for the HR. For the HR it's two months. So I updated that
to two months.
Pre28:30
Minimum of three months TSAs. So yeah, you can update this. Two months. The
program has a minimum of three months.
Jeff28:38
Got it, got it. But okay, the information that we received from the HR team
was two months.
Pre28:42
Sure.
Jeff28:43
And the cost that they mentioned, it's only also for the two months. So are
we supposed to add it and the month cost in it in that case?
Pre28:50
So the program wants a minimum of 3 month tsas and so short term would be 3
months. I think we can, let's put a monthly cost first and then we can
determine the duration and then talk to her.
Jeff29:03
Okay, got it. It's there, it's there.
Pre29:05
Okay, cool. Hey, sorry, Arpit, I have to. Anything else? I have to jump on
this other call.
Jeff29:13
One more thing. But yeah, okay, fine. I'll text you.
Pre29:16
Yeah, please. Thank you, sir.
Jeff29:19
And I want to attend the ecc so I'll take it up.
Pre29:23
I will be attending. Please take that up. I will have to attend. Maybe Matt
can attend that. I've got to get on this PMO call. Okay, thank you. Can you
forward. Thank you.
Jeff29:54
Kind of set his expectations for the, for the day and any introductory
comments there. So yeah, we'll put that in that first section to kick it
off. That's a good suggestion.
Pre30:05
Good.
Jeff30:06
Awesome. Awesome. So looking forward to that. I think that's going to be
very helpful event.
Aaron Hicks30:17
Awesome.
Jeff30:17
All right, back to you pre.
Pre30:20
Yep, thanks, Jeff. Any other questions on the rolling calendar?
Aaron Hicks30:24
Move to the next topic.
Pre30:31
Okay. We have some slides on the debt strategy call or someone from IT able
to cover this.
Aaron Hicks30:42
Yeah, that's going to be me. Oh, go ahead.
Jeff30:44
Yep.
Pre30:45
Aaron Hicks is on the phone, so. Hi Aaron.
Jeff30:47
Thank you for joining us.
Aaron Hicks30:49
Of course. Yeah, I'm happy to be here guys and thank you for the
opportunity to present this morning. So guys, we're going to talk a little
about a couple of things here. Our DAX DCN workshop. So this is a workshop
that happened April 28th through 30th, the second workshop that we've had.
We've actually got got one that's planned for June. Just to let you know
that we continue to host these collaboration workshops. It includes our
Solstice business leaders as well as key leaders from both sides and people
who are doing the implementation and execution of the program. As noted
here, in the last workshop, we had over 70 participants covering all of the
major service towers that are going to help drive this across the line. I
think a lot of very productive work happened during this last workshop. For
me, the highlights were we actually got to a point of developing a
comprehensive SOW that's consolidated and we'll talk a little bit more
about that in just a minute. We also talked about, you know, whether or not
we needed to establish an active directory trust. In an ideal world, we'd
have a bi directional trust between our legacy Honeywell environment and
our new Solstice environment. However, we've already implemented over 100
servers and other infrastructure that are tied to Azure Active Directory
service. And so that's not really reality. So we did talk through that and
then we talked about when we actually need ServiceNow in place and
functional. We agreed that we would have that operational on day one. We
continue to use our existing ServiceNow infrastructure until day one, until
we achieve day one. But really the focus of this update is going to try and
bring you along in terms of how we're going to do the PC migrations. What
does that look like in terms of mobile devices and then helping you guys
understand how we're going to execute this over the next few weeks. And if
there are any questions you have as we go through this, please let me know.
For those of you I haven't met, I lead the site support services for the
Americas. I've got about 300 sites. Longtime Honeywell employee over 30
years and have done things like running global IT operations for many, many
years. So that's a little about me. Haven't met you yet. All right, let's
go on to the next slide. If there are any questions here. So this is our
consolidated timeline and I do want to open it up for some discussion on
this slide and just make sure that you guys have any questions you have
answered. Between me and Michael Nobodney, we can answer those questions,
but basically we're working on the infrastructure standup right now, as you
guys can see, these are going to be key deliverables or milestones that we
need to achieve in order to start the PC testing and deploy deployment
process. Really the key here for us is making sure that we stand up the new
intune tenant. That is a work in progress right now, and we're working to
meet that July 1st date. So we're on track there. The other key things for
us are going to be making sure that we've got our refresh PC inventories,
I'm sorry, PC refresh order submitted so that we can advance those PC
refreshes of which we have about 2200 or so, ultimately that will be
refreshed or updated. We're doing that primarily because PCs that we know
that are going to age out between now and October, PCs that we know have
low what we call digital experience scores. So these are performing PCs and
then, you know, PCs that are part of tech debt. Our goal goal here with
Solstice and transitioning the support is to make sure that when we do the
transition of support, we're giving you an environment that is completely
free of tech debt. So you are current, you are running on the latest
operating system, you have the latest service packs, and from an
operational standpoint, we transition that in a seamless way to make it as
easy as possible on the new operations support team. Again, when we look at
some of the other things, making sure that we have our M365 tenant ready,
our mobility device management tenant ready, and everything ready from a
mailbox provisioning standpoint. But those are the.

<li>Critical emphasis on data accuracy and readiness before presenting to l=
eadership, especially regarding mitigation for delays.</li>
<li>Ongoing process to collect and clean data for current project status, r=
equiring communication across multiple teams and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Updates to CCX (Customer Care Experience), DCM (Data Center Management)=
, TSA (Transition Services Agreement) bottoms-up models, heatmaps, and stan=

uot;build back&quot;) implications are being mapped.</li>
<li>Highlighted criticality of tracking, receiving, and integrating missing=
 data, especially from BCN and DCN teams, and aligning with financial model=
s (e.g., alignment with the $50=E2=80=9360M &quot;non-personnel&quot; cost =
estimates).</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">Key Points<=
/h4><ul>
<li>Several teams (e.g., DCN, CCX, Data Intelligence) are delayed in delive=
ring hosting, license, and cost data.</li>
<li>Need to distinguish TSA operational costs versus standalone costs and e=

 Standalone Cost Modeling</h3><h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px=
;font-size:1.5rem">Summary</h4><ul>
<li>Lively debate and clarification around which costs belong to TSA-run op=
erations versus Day-1 Standalone environments.</li>
<li>TSA costs currently include depreciation, contingency, short-term servi=
ces (e.g., HR), and application run costs. Updates to TSAs (e.g., addition =
of apps, removal of others) require continuous updates to cost models.</li>
<li>Build back applications must move from TSA cost to Standalone cost trac=

<li>Clear need to add contract and service costs for newly identified TSAs =
(e.g., decks, HR).</li>
<li>The importance of breaking down cost components: infrastructure, softwa=
re, licensing, support, hardware, and distinguishing internal vs. external =
labor.</li>
<li>Some data (e.g., from HR team) may be based on shorter durations (2 mon=

going to reach back out to them and say, I don&#39;t have the value for the=
se two new apps. Let me go. Give it to me. So the ask of them was always th=
at sewerage guy and the others was give me for the 300 apps in scope in Ath=
ens, just give me what you have in the CMDB. We can filter the 98 or the 92=
 or the 94 to get a view and build our model, but we should get a total TCO=
 from them of everything that&#39;s in Scope for Athens. Naturally, 100 of =
them are live without, so they&#39;re not going to. We don&#39;t need it, b=
ut we should get it. 50 of them are a build back. So technically speaking t=
here may be some components here we can take out of it, but new licensing o=
r new support we should be able to get from Athens. Some of them are move a=
s is. So we should be able to see what sort of support is there and if ther=
e&#39;s a comparable thing that Athens is doing or at least the hosting wil=
l be the same. So I think that&#39;s where I was looking to get this inform=
ation and right now I still don&#39;t know what&#39;s missing.</div></div><=

75569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Of course. Yeah, I&#39;m happy to be =
here guys and thank you for the opportunity to present this morning. So guy=
s, we&#39;re going to talk a little about a couple of things here. Our DAX =
DCN workshop. So this is a workshop that happened April 28th through 30th, =
the second workshop that we&#39;ve had. We&#39;ve actually got got one that=
&#39;s planned for June. Just to let you know that we continue to host thes=
e collaboration workshops. It includes our Solstice business leaders as wel=
l as key leaders from both sides and people who are doing the implementatio=
n and execution of the program. As noted here, in the last workshop, we had=
 over 70 participants covering all of the major service towers that are goi=
ng to help drive this across the line. I think a lot of very productive wor=
k happened during this last workshop. For me, the highlights were we actual=
ly got to a point of developing a comprehensive SOW that&#39;s consolidated=
 and we&#39;ll talk a little bit more about that in just a minute. We also =
talked about, you know, whether or not we needed to establish an active dir=
ectory trust. In an ideal world, we&#39;d have a bi directional trust betwe=
en our legacy Honeywell environment and our new Solstice environment. Howev=
er, we&#39;ve already implemented over 100 servers and other infrastructure=
 that are tied to Azure Active Directory service. And so that&#39;s not rea=
lly reality. So we did talk through that and then we talked about when we a=
ctually need ServiceNow in place and functional. We agreed that we would ha=
ve that operational on day one. We continue to use our existing ServiceNow =
infrastructure until day one, until we achieve day one. But really the focu=
s of this update is going to try and bring you along in terms of how we&#39=
;re going to do the PC migrations. What does that look like in terms of mob=
ile devices and then helping you guys understand how we&#39;re going to exe=
cute this over the next few weeks. And if there are any questions you have =
as we go through this, please let me know. For those of you I haven&#39;t m=
et, I lead the site support services for the Americas. I&#39;ve got about 3=
00 sites. Longtime Honeywell employee over 30 years and have done things li=
ke running global IT operations for many, many years. So that&#39;s a littl=
e about me. Haven&#39;t met you yet. All right, let&#39;s go on to the next=
 slide. If there are any questions here. So this is our consolidated timeli=
ne and I do want to open it up for some discussion on this slide and just m=
ake sure that you guys have any questions you have answered. Between me and=
 Michael Nobodney, we can answer those questions, but basically we&#39;re w=
orking on the infrastructure standup right now, as you guys can see, these =
are going to be key deliverables or milestones that we need to achieve in o=
rder to start the PC testing and deploy deployment process. Really the key =
here for us is making sure that we stand up the new intune tenant. That is =
a work in progress right now, and we&#39;re working to meet that July 1st d=
ate. So we&#39;re on track there. The other key things for us are going to =
be making sure that we&#39;ve got our refresh PC inventories, I&#39;m sorry=
, PC refresh order submitted so that we can advance those PC refreshes of w=
hich we have about 2200 or so, ultimately that will be refreshed or updated=
. We&#39;re doing that primarily because PCs that we know that are going to=
 age out between now and October, PCs that we know have low what we call di=
gital experience scores. So these are performing PCs and then, you know, PC=
s that are part of tech debt. Our goal goal here with Solstice and transiti=
oning the support is to make sure that when we do the transition of support=
, we&#39;re giving you an environment that is completely free of tech debt.=
 So you are current, you are running on the latest operating system, you ha=
ve the latest service packs, and from an operational standpoint, we transit=
ion that in a seamless way to make it as easy as possible on the new operat=
ions support team. Again, when we look at some of the other things, making =
sure that we have our M365 tenant ready, our mobility device management ten=
ant ready, and everything ready from a mailbox provisioning standpoint. But=
 those are the.</div></div></div><div style=3D"margin-top:36px;text-align:c=
