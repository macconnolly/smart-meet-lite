Meeting Summary

*Date:* June 6, 2025
*Attendees:* (names mentioned: Pre, Mac, Brian, Jeff, Rakesh, Rob, Steven,
Sunshine, Tyler, Sriram, DJ, Ana)
*Project:* Athens IT Testing, UAT, and Cutover Progress Reporting Dashboard
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *Dashboarding and Reporting Needs for Leadership*

   - *Background:*
      - UAT (User Acceptance Testing) is starting for the Athens project.
      - Leadership wants regular dashboard views and progress reporting on
      items such as SIT (System Integration Testing), UAT, cutovers, go-liv=
es,
      and hypercare (immediate support after go-live).
      - There is a specific ask for burn-down charts showing progress over
      time, as well as reporting on hypercare issues and triaging activitie=
s.
   - *Requirements:*
      - Dashboards must be built on the existing Capital Edge trackers,
      specifically the BRV (Business Requirement Validation) inventory trac=
ker.
      - Additional columns/fields are needed to support SIT and UAT
      readiness reporting, including more detailed attributes.

2. *Feasibility and Technical Approach*

   - *Enhancements to Tracker:*
      - Adding extra columns/fields (text, lookups, drop-downs) is
      straightforward.
      - Once requirements for additional data points are provided, a
      one-to-one comparison will be made with the current tracker.
      - The updated tracker will be the basis for further dashboards (e.g.,
      bar charts, burndowns, heat maps), including standard hypercare
reporting.
   - *Reporting Approach:*
      - With necessary data points, Capital Edge can support various
      dashboards and custom reports.
      - Examples from previous projects (e.g., J&J) to be provided for
      inspiration/methodology, especially with drill-throughs and user
      interaction.
   - *Data Import/Export:*
      - Manual data updates can be uploaded via bulk import/export,
      minimizing heavy manual labor as long as formatting (e.g., no errant
      spaces) is kept clean.

3. *Hypercare Issue Tracking*

   - *Central Tracking Proposal:*
      - Debate over whether Capital Edge should act as the central
      repository for Level 2 and above hypercare issues.
      - Help desk tickets (Level 1) remain outside the tracker, but any
      escalated or cross-functional issue should be logged centrally for
      effective tracking and dashboard reporting.
      - Capital Edge=E2=80=99s RAID log (Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions)
      function strongly considered for this purpose.

4. *Process and Scenario Tracking*

   - *Distinction between Data Sets:*
      - Discussion on whether to inventory process scenarios explicitly.
      - The systems tracker in Capital Edge may already contain pertinent
      statuses (e.g., testers identified, scenarios defined, testing comple=
te).
      - Consensus that inventorying every scenario may not be necessary;
      instead, key process-level progress is what matters for leadership
      visibility.
      - Suggestion to track test script location and ownership on Teams if
      more detail is needed.
   - *System vs Process Tracking:*
      - Systems readiness to be tracked at the system level (e.g., 82 or
      290+ systems), with statuses such as SIT/UAT start/end, testing
completion,
      and more.
      - For processes, focus on those truly changing=E2=80=94e.g., =E2=80=
=9Cof 100
      functional processes, 50 are changing and require testing.=E2=80=9D
      - Concern raised about the complexity and practicality of mapping
      every process to every system; effort may outweigh value for
some analytics.
      - Leadership is interested in a clear, program-level view, e.g., =E2=
=80=9COut
      of 50 relevant processes, 37 tested, 13 planned by July 15=E2=80=9D, =
with similar
      information for cross-functional processes.

5. *End-to-End and Cross-Functional Process Tracking*

   - *Governance Structure:*
      - Structured weekly calls exist with end-to-end process leads (e.g.,
      Sriram for Order-to-Cash, DJ for P2P), managed by Rob.
      - Proposal to piggyback on this governance to track progress on
      end-to-end scenario validation, potentially via a simple checklist
      maintained in Excel or ported to Capital Edge.
      - Suggestion to have each end-to-end lead be accountable for checking
      off readiness/test items for their domain and reporting progress on a
      manageable list of end-to-end processes.
   - *Consolidated Reporting Needs:*
      - Leadership (specifically Jeff and Pierce) expects a consolidated
      dashboard showing readiness on key process scenarios (e.g., how many
      cross-functional processes, how many tested by which function).
      - Exploration of leveraging high-level checklists developed by the
      LES team for end-to-end process readiness, as these provide simple,
      actionable validation steps, rather than granular test cases.

6. *Data Model and Reporting Alignment*

   - *Tracker Field Additions:*
      - Proposal to extract updated system inventory from Capital Edge and
      add remaining needed attributes (service owner, SIT/UAT dates, comple=
tion
      flags, etc.) for all systems (noted figure: 296 systems).
      - Brian and Mac to collaborate on spreadsheet structure and efficient
      data management (use of lookups, dropdowns, standardized fields).
   - *Mockups and Examples:*
      - Mac to send existing report mockups and J&J examples to Brian,
      demonstrating key dashboard features like drill-throughs and
system-process
      mapping.
      - Need to ensure compatibility of data model for seamless report
      functionality (e.g., proper data connections, slicers).

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Tracker/Inventory Updates:*
   - Extract up-to-date system inventory (296 systems) from Capital Edge.
      - Add required columns: service owner, SIT/UAT start/end dates,
      completion trackers, relevant flags.
      - Mac to send the updated file with these new attributes to Brian for
      review.
   2.

   *Review and Data Mapping:*
   - Brian to review the file, identify improvements (lookup, dropdown
      fields), and align with Mac prior to implementation.
      - Update data model to match reporting needs, especially for mockup
      dashboards.
   3.

   *Dashboard Mockups and Examples:*
   - Mac to send previous dashboard examples (J&J, others) and
      Athens-specific mockups to Brian, highlighting desired features.
      - Collaborate on how to recreate/adjust these dashboards for Athens
      within Capital Edge constraints.
   4.

   *Data Integration:*
   - Ensure data model supports required dashboard features, including
      slicers, drill-throughs, and report slice-and-dice.
      - Validate ability to reuse/adjust prior reporting templates for
      Athens, ensuring all slicers and underlying data are available.
   5.

   *Hypercare Tracking Decision:*
   - Align internally and possibly with relevant client teams on whether
      Level 2+ hypercare issues will be centrally managed/tracked
within Capital
      Edge.
   6.

   *End-to-End Process Reporting:*
   - Find time for Rob, Mac, and Pre to discuss leveraging process leads'
      weekly calls and governance for end-to-end process readiness reportin=
g.
      - Explore importing LES team=E2=80=99s readiness checklist into the r=
eporting
      structure.
   7.

   *Reporting to Leadership:*
   - Develop a simple structure to enable process leads to check off
      progress/status and aggregate into leadership updates (weekly, with
      outlined tested/planned items by date, e.g., =E2=80=9C13 processes
planned by July
      15th=E2=80=9D).
      - Coordinate with Rob and Steven prior to client-facing (Jeff,
      Pierce).

------------------------------
Follow-Up Points

   - *Internal Alignment Meeting:*
      - Mac to set up a separate meeting with Rob and Pre to finalize the
      reporting structure for end-to-end processes prior to engaging with
      client-side leadership.
   - *Ongoing Dashboard Development:*
      - Iterative process to update, test, and refine dashboard mockups as
      data points and structural requirements become clearer.
   - *Hypercare Tracker Decision:*
      - To be confirmed pending clarification of where and how issues
      should be tracked for post-go-live support.
   - *Future Syncs:*
      - Action items for follow-up meetings and status checkpoints,
      especially as new reports are mocked up and tested.

------------------------------
Key Dates & Figures Mentioned

   - *June 6, 2025:* Date of this meeting.
   - *July 15th (example):* Used as a prospective milestone target date for
   planning/testing efforts.
   - *Systems in Scope:*
      - 82 systems for standard dashboard (systems readiness view).
      - Approximately 296 total systems in big-picture inventory.
   - *Processes in Scope:*
      - Example: 100 functional processes, of which 50 are changing and
      require focused testing.
      - 156 new or changed processes out of a broader suite of 1200+.

------------------------------
Additional Notes

   - Consistent emphasis on avoiding overly complex tracking that does not
   yield sufficient value.
   - Importance of leveraging existing project governance and team
   accountability structures.
   - Simplicity in process checklist and status marking to drive timely and
   actionable leadership reporting.
   - Attention to maintaining data model integrity for all
   imported/exported reporting artifacts.

*End of Summary*

Mac0:00
What the view is or what data points we're pulling. I don't have a lot.
Brian0:02
Yeah, yeah. So absolutely. So what we're looking to do is we have mocked up
a couple actually. Hey Pre.
Pre0:13
Hey. Sorry about that. That like UAT call went over a little bit.
Brian0:18
No, you're good. How did it go?
Pre0:20
It was fine.
Brian0:22
That's good.
Rakesh0:22
Hey guys.
Pre0:23
Action items as usual.
Rakesh0:24
Yeah, yeah. Hey Mac, I didn't realize you were not on that invite.
Brian0:30
Yeah, I, I, I thought it was this one. Honestly I was looking at my
calendar and I, that's why I thought that it was at 11 and I thought it was
this one.
Rakesh0:39
Okay, okay, we'll make sure you're on the next one. You need to be on that
one. But yeah. Okay, let's get started on this. So Pre, I know we have a
few other catch ups, but let's talk through this. Hey Brian, good to
connect again. Hopefully Friday's going well. Hopefully going well. Yep,
yep, doing all right. So we wanted to connect with you. So one of the
things, you know, UAT is kicking off here on Athens. So what we were
looking to do is, you know, Jeff and leadership is starting to ask for
dashboarding and progress reporting on slew of items from an IT perspective
how IT testing is going on. So sit UAT testing and how the cutovers, you
know, the go lives are happening. He's asking for, they're asking for burn
downs on, you know, how the cutover is getting reported on, the go lives
are reported on. There's also quite a bit of ask on, you know, hypercare
and hypercare issues and triaging etc. So first thing first though, what we
wanted to do is talk to you about how we can build some dashboarding onto
existing capital edge trackers that we have. There's a BRV inventory
tracker that we are going to leverage fully, add a few more attributes and
columns in there and fields that we're going to leverage to start reporting
on for sit UAT readiness. So what we wanted to connect with you this
morning on was to see one, feasibility of that, two, the complexity and
three, you know, what needs to get done if the first two questions are
answered. Two, you know, we have the sort of the design, the basic design,
the requirements, the wireframe of it, for lack of a better word. But we're
looking to see, you know, what that effort would be to enable this view
dashboarding reporting on top of the existing capital edge reports trackers
that we have.
Brian2:56
And so I'll tackle it in kind.
Mac2:59
Of two parts so for the tracker, additional columns, data points, we can
add anything in there and that's relatively easy. It can either be text
field lookups or drop downs. That's really just based on what you have in
here. Okay, if you'll provide that and I can do a one to one comparison,
make sure we have everything again that's in this, in the BRV tracker and
then once we have that, that takes care of the data point as far as the
reporting. If we have data points we can build any number of trackers
whether it's the bar chart you're showing there, a true burn down or
anything else as far as that kind of typical hypercare tracking that we
would see.
Rakesh3:42
Okay, Pre, okay, so we'll certainly send you that and we can have follow on
conversations. Matt can certainly have that with you and the team on how
we're thinking that. I'll give you some examples of what we did pre that we
did in J, you know, diamond and J and J and others that we can for the most
part the look and feel of it, see how we can, you know, replicate that for
Athens on the other portion where he wanted also Hypercare, we need to
understand how that dashboarding would work. Are we looking at it out of
Capital Edge or are those separate reports where Hypercare is going to be
coming in? We're going to be tracking issues and reporting on issues. Those
are probably somewhere else but it would be good to get a tracker if we're
doing it in Capital Edge and report out of it.
Pre4:36
So I think for that one we gotta align. Like are we gonna push this group
to put issues like is Capital Edge gonna be our kind of like central
repository of issues? Now I understand like someone calls the help desk, a
ticket gets created in the help desk. Like that's fine, that can get
managed at that level. But level 2 onwards, everything should be in a
central tracker. We don't need the detail tickets that are being called in
at the help desk at the central tracker. But we do need if it comes to a
regional call, if one of the IT war rooms decides that it has cross
functional impact, right. Like that it has to be pushed into call it like a
central hypercare tracker. Right. And so if we decide it's like a Capital
Edge RAID log, I think that kind of makes it pretty easy. A lot of people
have access to Capital Edge already. There's like reporting that we can
drive off of it if you know, so we just got to like come in with that point
of view, I guess.
Rakesh5:54
Understood. Okay, so I so What? And for your benefit, Mac as well. So
Brian, I think there are two distinct things forming. One from a inventory
that's already there, we'd like to have a multitude of reports that we are
able to run and provide to leadership. The other part I think that PRI was
mentioning is there's all these processes and scenarios that are going to
get cut over or tested. I don't know. Pre. What are your thoughts on where
are we tracking those? Are those in the. From the process tracker as well?
We should have a.
Pre6:29
Scenarios like what gets tested, you're saying?
Rakesh6:32
Yeah, yeah. Like, like for example, in the BRV process tracker, I believe
we have, you know, there's some tracker around KT ready, scenarios defined,
test cases, number tested, etc. So is the understanding that we will track
out of that process tracker.
Pre6:57
A couple things here. The systems tracker in Capital Edge has statuses for
things like testers identified, scenarios defined, testing complete. What
we can do is pull that into the functional dashboard so that where we're
showing systems like right now, it's just like a broad systems line. We can
have this broken into.
Rakesh7:31
We touched on that.
Pre7:32
Testers identified, scenarios defined, testing complete and that can pull
those statuses in. That's a little bit different from. To be honest, I
don't think we need to inventory this scenario. I mean, you tell me. I
don't know that we need to inventory the scenarios, but if we do, I would
think the team site is probably the place to do it. Okay, but then we don't
put your test scripts in your functional folders on teams, something like
that.
Rakesh8:10
Okay.
Pre8:11
If the intention is to try and get test scripts, then like that's that. But
so if we, if we use Jeff's lens and we like separate out the end to end
testing from like functional testing. Right.
Rakesh8:26
And system. Yeah. And the system's readiness.
Pre8:29
Yeah, correct. And if we like apply Pierce's principle that like the
business owns it, like from our perspective, we just want to know that this
stuff is complete and like progressing. I don't know that we care like too
much about like the scope. Do you know what if like Will Johnson says that
he is tested Hyperion, then like he's tested Hyperion. Like it's not really
for us to prosecute. Whether or not.
Rakesh8:54
Sure.
Pre8:55
It's actually.
Rakesh8:56
Yeah, sure, sure. Okay. No, I saw you there.
Pre9:01
That's for that. The end to end. This is where I think it might be worth
like so put the end to end stuff aside.
Rakesh9:10
Right.
Pre9:10
Like I think we still need to do the exercise to identify like which
functions are testing what systems and ensure that's correctly mapped. So
this is flowing into their BRB status report out. We may be able to get
like. And Brian, you tell me like, maybe like a summary view of like, of
all the 22 systems, how many have finished testing? How many are like a
heat map? So you would have all of the systems down here and the various
statuses and you can just sort of color kind of show a heat map of how the
systems are progressing against all of the various statuses.
Brian9:56
Well, that's exactly what we'll need to get to that. The dashboard view for
the systems that Rakesh was speaking to, to get to the burndown point,
you'll need that as well. You'll need like the system with the UAT status,
start and end dates and then tracking against the other metrics.
Rakesh10:11
So this is a bit different, Mac, because if I'm understanding you right
pre, the system's readiness is we're taking it off of the system Tracker.
We have 82 systems or so we know when SIT is done. The dashboard we just
displayed earlier the illustrations, the linking to the process saying,
listen, I've got the process tracker, I need to test 100 processes. They
touch five systems. Maybe it's at a process level, we don't need it a
system level there. So let's say, for example, 100 processes need to be
within a function. There's 100 process, 50 of them are changing and so they
need some sort of testing. And so we get, we track that there are 50
processes that are truly changing and those are tested, they touch five
systems and, you know, three of those systems have been touched, two of
those systems have not been touched. So do we need to provide. What I was
reading when I, when I heard Jeff say these, the conversation, I thought he
wanted a view of, you know, peers to come in there and say, oh, I supply
chain, I've got 100 processes in play, 50 of them really changing. And so I
need to test. So My scope is 50 processes. I need to know where the
progress is on how many of those processes have I tested, what process
issues do I have for hypercare, etc. So how would we get that reporting if
it is from Capital Edge, from this BRV or the process tracker, how can we
get. Is that just fields in here that we say processes?
Pre11:55
So there is a field that tells you which of these processes are new.
There's about 156 processes of the full suite of like 1200 or whatever. We
could probably even like filter off the legal spin one. So that'll kind of
give us a lesser 135. Now the problem is these processes are not tied to a
system. And I like, almost wonder.
Brian12:26
That's what I was like, that's what I was sort of getting is we.
Pre12:29
Can back to the function, right? So like if I look at finance, if we know
that finance needs to test 10 of the 22 BRB systems, we. I'm almost
wondering if like we just give finance this list to say, like, hey, these
are your new processes, ensure that these are part of your test scripts.
And then it kind of like falls back to the function as they're defining
their test scripts to ensure that they're considering new processes.
Otherwise we have to go through like an intense mapping and we did this for
people, Rakesh. And I don't think it's like yielding the results that we
wanted to yield, tell you the truth, because like, much like hiring. Right,
okay, you have to test every system, right, like to a certain level. And
like we can like drive some analytics, but it's not like getting us like it
almost like it takes so much effort to get the analytics.
Rakesh13:40
Okay, fair enough. I get your point. Then how do we. And again, I know
Brian and you, Mac, we're not on this conversation and we're trying to
address some of Jeff's asks because what I see him asking is peers having a
weekly update now saying across this, let's say for these function x50
processes in scope, we have tested 37 of them and we've planned another 13
by July 15th. But there are also cross functional processes that touch five
functions. And for those we've got let's say 25 cross functional processes
and each of those functions has tested their portion or something to the
effect where, you know, there's also a system linkage in there. But I'm not
so much worried about systems. It's really a tracker on. I've got a cross
functional process here that touches four functions and a bunch of IT
systems. I'm tracking to that. How would we track to that to say, okay,
I've got 25 cross functional processes.
Pre14:56
When we say cross functional processes, we're talking about the end to end
ones, right?
Rakesh14:59
End to end to end.
Pre15:01
So I think like. So you. Where was the. Those UAT slides that we have? I
thought like did a good job of laying out the various processes under like
order to cash or what have you.
Rakesh15:21
Yeah, yeah, the UAT kickoff.
Pre15:23
So this is where we have to have a conversation with Rob and, and Steven
Because I think that like, can we, I think there, it's a page, right? Like.
Rakesh15:39
You mean the governance structure that.
Pre15:41
No, no, like those scenarios, I didn't think of them as like a lot of
scenarios. Like, there's just like a page worth of like scenarios for uat,
for order to cash, for, to pay. Right. Like, and mom was wondering if we
can like piggyback off of their structure, off of their governance
structure to say like, hey, you have your end to end leads already
identified. These end to end leads are working through cutover planning
right now. But can we also add to their scope to test this? You know what I
mean? Like, they, they, they, they've got like a weekly call set up and
they've got, right. What have you. So can, can we just have that whoever is
like ordered a cash, for example, can we have him just like run through
these and like identify, like identify someone to, to check off all of
these? You know?
Rakesh16:44
We can, I think. Yes, but then is there some consolidated dashboard
reporting on this to say order to cash? You know, we've tested, let us say
eight lines here are, you know, billing and consolidation or collections
has, you know, a few systems across these. And we've tested, we've tested
these nine lines here.
Pre17:09
Yeah, yeah, because there's so like again, it doesn't feel like that many.
Right. Because there's so few. Can we not just like take this, put it in an
Excel, put a name against it and just like try to get people to. You know
what I mean? Like put it.
Rakesh17:25
Yeah, we can, we can, we don't need to over engineer totally. Can we move
this into Capital Edge and so we can.
Pre17:34
So sorry, this is the governance I was talking about. Right. So like they
have these people, Sriram, for all the cash, DJ for P2P. I don't know who
Ana is, but what have you. We have these people set up. Can we piggyback
off of Rob's call? He has a weekly call with these people.
Rakesh17:53
Yeah.
Pre17:53
And have them again, like very simply, Sriram would be like, hey, Sriram,
we need someone from your team to go in and sort of really like check these
items off.
Rakesh18:08
Yeah, yeah. So who will report out on it? Because what I heard, what's his
name, Jeff say is that he's expecting peers to provide an updated view or
report on this. On what is the end to end process. I know you brought up
the good point of, okay, let's sync up and have the business run this with
these guys with precisely the governance model you showed, but I thought
Pierce Got on the hook too. Was on the hook now to do that.
Pre18:38
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe an internal discussion with Rob first before we
involve client. But my thought is like if we give them a really simple
structure because again we should also have in perspective. Right. The
system's not changing. It's like metadata on the system.
Rakesh18:55
That's true for many.
Pre18:57
That is we shouldn't have breakpoints or anything like that. Right. Like
there's like you're not. It's the same order entry Systems. Right.
Salesforce.com EDI what have you. It's going through the same ERP that's
like getting rename, reuse. It's not even like a new company code or
anything like that. And like so really we're testing that like the metadata
on like these things like you know, purchase orders, what have you are like
looking. Right.
Rakesh19:28
You know what I mean?
Pre19:29
Like so I just feel like we should. But. But if. And, and if this list is
too long too. I think. Let me pull up another list that Sam. So the LES
team, they've been looking into end to end process readiness and they
develop a high level you that we can also leverage for this. Right. So
that's an even shorter list. Right. So it's like have suppliers and vendors
received updated legal. This one is like a readiness item.
Rakesh20:10
But like it's more of a checklist here.
Pre20:12
Correct. It's like a checklist of like vendor master data. Can someone like
take you know, review test that? Can you pay vendors? Can you purchase
orders? Like it's like a.
Rakesh20:25
These are truly test cases. Seem to be more of a test case for POSO
success. Right. So it's a. This is more. If you run a tabletop exercise,
these are sort of the steps you will go through and say can I do this? Yes,
done commercial, I pass it on to you supply chain, you receive it next you
run through. So this is almost a. Yeah. A step, you know, exercise.
Pre20:48
Right, Right. So my point is like if we layer in UAT to this like readiness
view. Right. Can this cutover team just also include uat, right. And like
go into the system and then just sort of check off the.
Rakesh21:08
Check off the end to end or LE related process in that system. System or.
Pre21:15
The check off that like the end. So it would be the end to end process lead
kind of coordinating that all of these items they've sort of tested and
like from a system perspective they think order to cache is ready.
Rakesh21:38
So like for example, can I set up a new customer? Right. So is that the
case? So if I play that out. Line number seven, can I set up a new
customer? Commercial is probably in the SFTC or is that in the erp? So it
may be a new setup in. So you need to have a view to say, okay, this is.
Now this lead can go into the system and set up a new customer in
Salesforce.
Pre22:09
Yeah.
Rakesh22:10
So now Salesforce doesn't have a UAT per se, because nothing is changing.
They're only going to get, you know, if I. If I play that in the context of
what's changing, erp, legal entities are changing, and those flow
downstream into Salesforce. And in Salesforce, they can see the new legal
entities that are Athens specific. So when a person here, as a commercial
lead comes in and says on, you know, once this is done in the QA system,
they'll only be able to see Athens legal entities. So they come in and they
say, can I set up a new customer for these? In the past, I had 50 legal
entities I could see. Now I only see 27, because that's what Athens is. So
within those 27 legal entities, that has now flowed downhill. I'm now able
to can I set up a new customer? Or it may be legal entity agnostic, but can
I set up a new customer for Athens in that Salesforce that reports right up
to the. To the right hierarchy. Right. So if that's the level of testing,
then yeah, we probably need to add in. Add in the system view here. But I
don't know how that would help because it doesn't test system readiness
because Salesforce is not changing. It's really validating. It's the data
flows into Salesforce and you're consuming. You know, you're going in and
seeing if you can. You can see that data in Salesforce. So again, not to
digress from this, I.
Pre23:39
Okay, again, that's fine. And I do think that you can kind of look at this
readiness checklist and say, like, you know, a lot of these are blue
because nothing is changing and then move as is. Right.
Rakesh23:54
Per system.
Pre23:54
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that, that, like, set up a new customer is a
good one because there's nothing changing from a setup new customer
process. Right.
Rakesh24:04
Presumably from a process, you should just be able to just set up a new
Athens customer.
Pre24:09
Correct. And the system isn't changing either. So that's probably one that
doesn't need to be tested. Right. So look through the list and pick the
things that do need to be tested.
Rakesh24:21
Okay, so now back to. Okay, so, Rob, maybe the immediate ask is, I think on
the inventory tracker. What we will do is we will extract out of capital
edge if we haven't already done, I think which we Mac has done. We will add
the attributes that we need for all 290 plus systems. You know, we've got
to add some service owner names, we've got to add some sit start and end
date name, you know, UAT start and end dates and some completion tracker
etc. And some flags we'll do and send an updated inventory of the 296
systems here for this tracker. I think the next piece on top of that then
is to layer in this, this reporting on can I. You know is. Is SIT complete?
Is knowledge transfer complete for the system? You know, is the UAT
complete, is cutover complete? So it's again running some dashboards or
reporting on top of this model.
Brian25:22
Brian, I'll work with you on that because I've done it manually but I think
that there's opportunity there to do lookups as well where we have that
data. I pulled them out of the inventory, the heat map and just put them
into an Excel manually so the Excel has the proper model and I can send you
what we have and then we can explore opportunities to make some of it
lookups.
Rakesh25:56
Right.
Brian25:56
Like the UAT dates and things like that. Like the.
Mac26:01
Yeah, yeah, dates like that always be the date field. That's just kind of
the dropdown or you can type it in. Yeah, but other things where it's
consistent and maybe it's five, six, seven options, whatever it might be,
make those the dropdowns. But yeah, if you send me that file, I'll go
through it, identify some of them and we can connect just to make sure that
we both agree and then move forward getting those put in.
Rakesh26:24
Awesome.
Mac26:25
And then for the actual updates we just do that through the bulk import
export process. Even if we do lookups as long as there's no errant spaces,
anything like that and just copy paste in values and it'll tell us which
ones error out. We can always fix them and then push it through that way so
there's no heavy manual effort there.
Brian26:43
Okay, sweet.
Rakesh26:45
Okay, so I think we have immediate next steps, at least tactical next steps
for this and we'll run some reports out of there so Mac action items for us
to connect with Brian to get that data and a mock up of the off the report,
the couple of reports that we can start showing.
Brian27:08
Yep. Do you want me to send him the ones that we started plus the JJ
examples?
Rakesh27:14
Yeah, the J and J. Yes, send the J and J examples, but more so how we want
to mimic that for what we're doing here.
Brian27:20
Exactly. And I mean, I'm not sure what Capital Edge is capable of, but the
J and J examples have good illustration of, like, drill throughs and the
way that they want to be able to, like, click into and view that data. So
I'll make sure that we get those sent over as well as how we mocked it up
for this.
Rakesh27:38
Okay, perfect. We'll have to make sure that.
Mac27:42
Capitalized already, or.
Rakesh27:43
Is that correct? Yeah.
Mac27:46
Okay. Yeah, they were already in there. We can probably do essentially a
lateral transfer and just redo data connections based on what we discussed
and then go from there.
Rakesh27:53
Oh, perfect. Okay. Makes life simpler. All right, so we'll. And then we'll
make sure that we have to make sure the data model is the same because
those reports pull certain things, the slicers and et cetera. We may not
have that, the underlying data. So we just have to be careful about
replicating it 100%.
Mac28:12
Yeah. And that'll be part of the dev process and the dev connections or
data connections.
Rakesh28:17
Excuse me.
Mac28:17
And then qat. Uat part of it on our end.
Rakesh28:20
Okay, sounds good. Thank you all.
Brian28:23
Cool. Thank you.
Rakesh28:24
We'll connect with you on other things, but let's. Yeah. I just want to
make sure that Jeff isn't. You know, he gave us a lot to do. I want to make
sure that it's not necessarily a lot.
Pre28:37
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fair. Let me find some time with us and Rob first.
Like, sometime today.
Rakesh28:42
Sounds good. Thank you all.
Brian28:43
Thank you.
Pre28:44
Thanks.
Mac28:45
Thanks, all.
Brian28:56
Hi, sunshine. Girl, you look so tan.
Pre28:58
Thank you.
Brian29:00
You look great.
Rakesh29:00
You look great.
Pre29:02
How are you doing?
Rakesh29:02
I'm doing great.
Brian29:03
How are you?
Rakesh29:04
Fabulous, humble.
Brian29:08
Tyler, thank you so much for the donut and the coffee.
Rakesh29:12
Yeah, Appreciate her. So sweet. We only had to ask, huh?
Brian29:18
What'd you say?
Rakesh29:19
I said, so sweet. We all had to ask.
Pre29:25
Oh, my God, that hurt.
Rakesh29:26
Okay, bathing suit face.
Pre29:30
Anything new?
Rakesh29:32
What are you going to New York for? We're flying back for. Who's in
Charlotte?
Brian29:37
Oh, just work. We're working for this company called Honeywell.
Pre29:44
Wait, I know Honeywell. Yeah, I have their pads in my bathroom.
Brian29:49
Pads?
Pre29:50
Yeah.
Rakesh29:51
Or is that honey pot?
Brian29:53
I think that's.

 connect with you. So one of the things, you know, UAT is kicking off here =
on Athens. So what we were looking to do is, you know, Jeff and leadership =
is starting to ask for dashboarding and progress reporting on slew of items=
 from an IT perspective how IT testing is going on. So sit UAT testing and =
how the cutovers, you know, the go lives are happening. He&#39;s asking for=
, they&#39;re asking for burn downs on, you know, how the cutover is gettin=
g reported on, the go lives are reported on. There&#39;s also quite a bit o=
f ask on, you know, hypercare and hypercare issues and triaging etc. So fir=
st thing first though, what we wanted to do is talk to you about how we can=
 build some dashboarding onto existing capital edge trackers that we have. =
There&#39;s a BRV inventory tracker that we are going to leverage fully, ad=
d a few more attributes and columns in there and fields that we&#39;re goin=
g to leverage to start reporting on for sit UAT readiness. So what we wante=
d to connect with you this morning on was to see one, feasibility of that, =
two, the complexity and three, you know, what needs to get done if the firs=
t two questions are answered. Two, you know, we have the sort of the design=
, the basic design, the requirements, the wireframe of it, for lack of a be=
tter word. But we&#39;re looking to see, you know, what that effort would b=
e to enable this view dashboarding reporting on top of the existing capital=
 edge reports trackers that we have.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom=

 Okay, if you&#39;ll provide that and I can do a one to one comparison, mak=
e sure we have everything again that&#39;s in this, in the BRV tracker and =
then once we have that, that takes care of the data point as far as the rep=

it&#39;s the bar chart you&#39;re showing there, a true burn down or anythi=

 how we&#39;re thinking that. I&#39;ll give you some examples of what we di=

n for the most part the look and feel of it, see how we can, you know, repl=
icate that for Athens on the other portion where he wanted also Hypercare, =
we need to understand how that dashboarding would work. Are we looking at i=
t out of Capital Edge or are those separate reports where Hypercare is goin=
g to be coming in? We&#39;re going to be tracking issues and reporting on i=
ssues. Those are probably somewhere else but it would be good to get a trac=

 that one we gotta align. Like are we gonna push this group to put issues l=
ike is Capital Edge gonna be our kind of like central repository of issues?=
 Now I understand like someone calls the help desk, a ticket gets created i=
n the help desk. Like that&#39;s fine, that can get managed at that level. =
But level 2 onwards, everything should be in a central tracker. We don&#39;=
t need the detail tickets that are being called in at the help desk at the =
central tracker. But we do need if it comes to a regional call, if one of t=
he IT war rooms decides that it has cross functional impact, right. Like th=
at it has to be pushed into call it like a central hypercare tracker. Right=
. And so if we decide it&#39;s like a Capital Edge RAID log, I think that k=
ind of makes it pretty easy. A lot of people have access to Capital Edge al=
ready. There&#39;s like reporting that we can drive off of it if you know, =
so we just got to like come in with that point of view, I guess.</div></div=

tanding you right pre, the system&#39;s readiness is we&#39;re taking it of=
f of the system Tracker. We have 82 systems or so we know when SIT is done.=
 The dashboard we just displayed earlier the illustrations, the linking to =
the process saying, listen, I&#39;ve got the process tracker, I need to tes=
t 100 processes. They touch five systems. Maybe it&#39;s at a process level=
, we don&#39;t need it a system level there. So let&#39;s say, for example,=
 100 processes need to be within a function. There&#39;s 100 process, 50 of=
 them are changing and so they need some sort of testing. And so we get, we=
 track that there are 50 processes that are truly changing and those are te=
sted, they touch five systems and, you know, three of those systems have be=
en touched, two of those systems have not been touched. So do we need to pr=
ovide. What I was reading when I, when I heard Jeff say these, the conversa=
tion, I thought he wanted a view of, you know, peers to come in there and s=
ay, oh, I supply chain, I&#39;ve got 100 processes in play, 50 of them real=
ly changing. And so I need to test. So My scope is 50 processes. I need to =
know where the progress is on how many of those processes have I tested, wh=
at process issues do I have for hypercare, etc. So how would we get that re=
porting if it is from Capital Edge, from this BRV or the process tracker, h=
ow can we get. Is that just fields in here that we say processes?</div></di=
