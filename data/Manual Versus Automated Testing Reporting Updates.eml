## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. **Manual vs. Automated Reporting and Testing**
- **Background/Context:** =20
    - Feedback from Jeff requested clarity in=
 reporting on what test scenarios are manual, automated, or semi-automated.
    - There is a need for better documentation of the execution flow, =
specifically distinguishing who is doing manual work versus those relying =
on automation.
    - The goal is to improve tracking and reporting =
granularity, particularly for defect tracking and test progress.
- **Bill=E2=80=99s Area:** =20
    - Bill clarified that new reporting will=
 clearly indicate whether each run was manual or automated.
    - A JIRA instance was created earlier that day for tracking TOSCA runs =
and manual test runs.
    - Both manual and automated runs will be uploaded=
 to JIRA for easy identification.
    - The JIRA environment is not fully =
set up=E2=80=94Bill is awaiting admin rights, and scripts/results are still=
 being loaded.
    - Until JIRA is ready (expected mid-week), daily manual =
reports will continue, using a mini dashboard for visualization.
    - Audrey is to assist in combining TOSCA outputs into the UAT readiness=
 and tracking sheets.
- **Reporting Cadence:** =20
    - Commitment to =
provide Jeff with an end-of-day Monday report; however, fully integrated =
automated reporting may only be possible by mid-week (e.g., Wednesday or =
Thursday).
    - Interim approach: Continue to generate and share manual =
progress reports.

---

### 2. **Data Ownership, Access, and Format**
- **Document Management:** =20
    - Work-in-progress Excel files are being=
 shared and updated.
    - Concern about providing editing access to all =
team members; preference for restricted (e.g., read-only) access to prevent=
 unintentional overwrites.
    - Srinivas committed to sharing updated =
files and granting selective access to Mac and others for reporting.
- **Reporting Structure:** =20
    - Agreement to standardize the reporting=
 formats (focus on scenarios and percent complete, rather than deeply =
granular steps, per previous guidance).
    - Both ERP and Finance test =
trackers will follow similar templates but may exist as separate tabs =
within the same workbook for time and efficiency.

---

### 3. **Test Coverage and Execution Detail**
- **Granularity of =
Hybrid/Semi-Automated Work:** =20
    - Clarified that in some cases, =
certain functional areas contain both automated and manual scripts.
    - Some business processes (e.g., external communications or purchasing =
through third-party portals like iValue) remain manual due to technical =
limitations.
    - JIRA will eventually track scenario counts by type =
(automated/manual) with pass/fail and output data.
- **Sample Metrics =
Mapping:** =20
    - Walk-through demonstrated where and how manual versus =
automated scenarios/scripts are logged and counted.
    - Explicit mapping of automated (e.g., TOSCA) and manual test cases, =
with color-coded tracking in Excel.
    - Commitment to continue updating =
and refining these reports as systems and integrations come online.

---

### 4. **External and Adjacent Testing Coordination**
- **Tollers and 3PLs Involvement:**
    - Email threads raised ambiguity =
about external testing responsibilities (specifically for tollers and =
third-party logistics providers).
    - Need for clarification on =
requirements, as some team members were unsure of expectations or technical=
 details.
    - Discussion around involving additional entities (e.g., =
commercial, legal) for any external-facing testing.
    - Plan to schedule a call (tentatively for Monday) with all =
stakeholders named in the email chain, possibly including Paul and Gokul =
for SIT, Sriram for UAT=E2=80=94to clarify external test scope and =
coordination needs.

---

### 5. **Weekly/Daily Reporting and Procedures**
- **Tab and Sheet Organization:** =20
    - Discussion around merging or =
keeping separate tabs for Finance (non-ERP) and ERP within summary =
workbooks.
    - Agreed that for efficiency and clarity, each area can =
maintain a tab in the same file, even if formatting is not 100% consistent.
    - Tabs will be renamed and color coded for quick identification (e.g., =
Bill=E2=80=99s section in pink, Srinivas=E2=80=99s in blue).
    - Plan to share both SIT and UAT schedules (with appropriate time zones=
 clearly labeled: IST and EST).
- **Operational Rhythm:** =20
    - End-of-day scrum/readout calls scheduled around 4:30 or 5:00 PM =
Eastern, with expectation that test results be finalized and available to =
report by then.
    - Reporting flows from manual Excel sheets into more =
formal systems as they come online (e.g., JIRA).

---

### 6. **Preparation for Transition and Handoffs**
- **Upcoming Changes:**
    - Jessica is on vacation; plan is for Pierce to handle the project =
kickoff meeting on Tuesday after a sync-up meeting Monday morning.
    - If Pierce is not comfortable, Jessica will step in as backup.
- **Near-term Next Steps:**
    - Additional discussion Monday to finalize =
reporting structure on manual vs. automated scenarios.
    - Suggestion for a simple, high-level summary (total number =
automated/manual, percentage complete) to start, and refine as needs evolve=
.

---

## Action Items

1. **Finalize JIRA Setup:** =20
    - Bill to obtain admin rights and ensure TOSCA scripts/results are =
loaded. =20
    - Rohit to finish loading results into JIRA.
    - Expected complete setup by Wednesday or Thursday next week.
2. **Daily/Interim Reporting:** =20
    - Continue daily manual reports =
(mini dashboards) until JIRA automated reports are available.

external testing coordination call with all relevant stakeholders (aim for =
Monday, June 23).
    - Assess need to involve commercial/legal or other =
entities for external test visibility or data sharing.
    - Identify if additional adjacent applications require a tailored test =
schedule.

    - Quickly update and publish SIT and UAT schedules with clear =
delineation between Finance and ERP/non-ERP areas.
5. **High-Level =
Reporting:** =20

Transcript:
0:00
And he's having a little bit of a =
meltdown and I don't want you guys to hear him screaming. But for Bill and =
Trini Vas, we're trying to take the feedback we got from Jeff about adding =
in some level of understanding what's manual versus what's automated into =
the reporting. So we want to start having some conversations now and then =
Rakesh and Mac are going to walk away over the weekend and then on Monday =
we're going to finish that conversation. But we had some questions around =
some of the functions. If you guys want to bring that Rakasha back. Bring =
that up.

0:31
Yeah.

0:31
Mac, do you mind bringing that? Both the ERP as =
well as the finance test. The same folder for finance and erp.

0:42
Yep. Give me one second. I'm getting those most recent Excels open. But I =
think that just to set the context a little bit, like Jeff's real question =
was like do we know any exactly in what order? And the people who are doing=
 the hands on keyboard work, have we gotten that coordination down? He =
wants to know the execution flow and it's about the technology, but it's =
about the execution flow too. So we're just trying to come up and =
brainstorm the best way to answer that question. Just give me a second and =
I'll get those two files pulled up.

1:17
Yeah, I'm sorry, quite. I didn't =
understand.

1:21
Yeah, so I think so part of this Srinivasa is we want to =
understand for those manual and automatic, semi automatic, we want to do a =
double click into understanding what part of this is automatic, what part =
of this is manual. And Bill, particularly in your area, I think you =
identified some as fully automatic, semi automatic, partial, etc. So I =
think we want to get a better understanding of that because where we want =
to see if it makes a difference in the reporting cadence and the tracking =
and reporting. So if you recall, Jeff mentioned this morning that he would =
like us to delineate how the testing was from an automatic perspective and =
a non automatic perspective and provide reporting along that as well as =
defect tracking along that. We're trying to see if that makes sense or if =
there's a better way to delineate it and report out on it. So to do that I =
think we just need to understand better of what part of these things are =
manual. It will go back into your defect tracker as well in that what part =
of this is manual, what part of this is semi manual, semi automatic and =
what can be and whether at the end of the day, once we get a view into that=
, whether it Makes sense to still keep that, keep that line of thinking. =
Yes, Bill.

2:50
I never got to use the raise hand button. Of course, I =
thought I might. You know, the good news is you don't have to worry about =
it because the reports that are going to come out are going to say whether =
it was a manual run or an automatic.

3:01
Okay. In within TOSCA or within =
anywhere else.

3:06
So I've created a JIRA instance so that the TOSCA runs=
 can be uploaded into JIRA and it'll say these were, you know, automatic =
runs and you know, the others will be manual runs.

3:24
Ah, okay.

3:27
So.

3:30
Let'S dive deeper into that. Okay.

3:32
So will the manual runs =
be shown in Jira 2? Well, the jurors are the combined manual and Tosca.

3:41
It can, and I haven't got that set up yet. I mean, literally, the =
juror was created this morning. They haven't even made me an administrator =
yet. Guys, we gotta pump the brakes a little bit and let things get done. =
Technology takes a minute to get set up, scripts get finished, loaded up in=
 there, practice runs. I know what Jeff wants, but Jeff's gotta understand =
that the world doesn't move at that speed.

4:02
I know. So. But when I was=
 on the call.

4:04
Today, he didn't sound like he had a tremendous amount =
of energy around it. Like, you better tell me on Monday. He didn't say =
anything like that. I told him 26 of the 50 scenarios were automated. He's =
like, okay, cool. I mean, I think you guys are overreacting to a man's =
single question.

4:21
So it's not just that behind the scenes he's been =
pinging. Right? So it's not what he says versus, versus how he acts later =
on is part of the challenge. So I'm with you. Things need not be frank with=
 him.

4:35
Marcus. Say, listen, you know, the tools and the solutions are =
getting provisioned in real time and you know, it's the weekend and people =
are going to work on it, you know, Sunday night in India, Monday morning =
our time, you know, when we get in. You know, hopefully by then I'll be the=
 administrator on that. Rohit will have loaded his results and stuff into =
jira. So it's not going to happen today.

5:03
So I'm not asking for it =
today. I'm just trying to understand the reporting so that he's expecting =
an end of day Monday report as we committed him. So I want to make sure the=
 structure is in place as we go through Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to say =
things have started, things are getting automated, things are getting =
reported. Here's how the report is going to take shape. Granted, it's walk =
before we run. So I don't expect this to be sorted out Monday. It's =
probably well into Wednesday, Thursday when all of this stuff will be =
flowing nicely. But I want at least have the structure so that when data =
starts flowing in, it's a matter of putting things in there and not =
spending too much time to try and report out to him.

5:50
Yep. So you know, once the, once Rohit gets everything lined up in there, =
you know, we'll generate a report and see what it looks like currently. =
Right now I'm getting reports every day on progress that are shareable but =
they won't be coming out of jira, you know, for in probably midweek or =
something like that. So in the meantime we'll share the manual reports in =
the fashion of the little mini dashboard that I created. And then I got, I =
get. Is Audrey on this call?

6:30
Probably not.

6:31
Okay, but I need to work with her so that we're combining the output from =
Tosca now into our sheet that has all of our UAT readiness and tracking =
tabs so that you know, it can be updated daily.

6:48
Okay. And the intent would be, and like I said, because we have an end of =
day readout or an end of day scrum call say 4:30 or 5 Eastern. The idea =
would be that a bit ahead of that, that you're, you're all able to say, =
Bill, that The tests for ERP scope gets completed say at 3:30 or something =
and then you have time to actually drop things in there. So that at 4:30 =
when you have the end of day call, it's just a readout, not too much work. =
Right. So. So that's what we're asking. I think that's the intent. I think =
we're all, you know, I think marching towards the same thing. I think the =
urgency is, is a bit different for Jeff versus us.

7:30
I think he'll understand what you're telling the truth. Being provisioned =
in real time. Ping, ping, ping, hit enter. You know, we fully anticipate =
that everyone will be set up, scripts will be set up in it JIRA and should =
be able to start generating a report that will delineate for you which runs=
 are manual, which runs were automatic. In the interim, we're going to =
produce a daily report, you know, manually that will show the same thing. =
You know, this was a manual run, this was a, an automated run. And here's =
how much we completed against what we thought we could.

8:02
Okay, so then Mac, you and I need to plug into that sheet that's there. And=
 rebuild or arrange this report this slide to indicate as such. Now on the =
flip side, on the finance side, Srinivas, I presume everything of yours is =
manual. And so your tracker, which will follow the same template as Bill's,=
 will also have that same level of detail. Yeah.

8:38
Let me quickly share my screen. I'll show you something. The same format =
that I considered what Bill was sharing yesterday. Something like this. You=
 guys could hear my screen.

8:56
I can. We can.

8:59
We eliminated the steps because the guidance given to us was that that was =
too, too granular. Just keep scenarios and percent complete.

9:07
Okay, Yeah. I mean I can delete that.

9:10
That's fine.

9:11
Keep it if you want. Keep it there. We'll. Our reporting will only take the=
 left hand side five. Okay, sure.

9:17
Now, is this in the live file? =
Sorry, is this in the live file? In teams.

9:24
I've just shared the =
updated one with Jessica. In teams. I'm little concerned to give access to =
everyone. Oh yeah, that's okay because I know most of them logs in and then=
 if they alter them, I know no one would do intentionally. But I don't want=
 to end up in a place where this becomes a.

9:46
Understood. Can you get =
access to Mac or myself for the reporting post?

9:51
I can do that. I can do that.

9:52
Okay, we promise, you know, pinky =
promise not to touch it. Read only. Access is once too.

9:59
No, that's fine. I'll give you the access. These two sheets are in work in =
still progress. UAT remote and outside. And then your testing site is kind =
of almost updated. And then the sheet also, I think a lot of information. =
You can go through it. Yeah, I'll get you the copy of this to you. Okay.

10:19
This is actually day by day. Okay, perfect. Now Bill, let me ask you =
one more question on your. And you will show that in that are there. When =
you say hybrid and semi automated are there in those steps. Some steps that=
 are automatic, some steps that are. No, no, no, no. Manual.

10:37
It's just that it's in that functional area there are automatic scenarios, =
mini scripts, I mean manual mini scripts and automatic end to end scripts.

10:48
Okay, okay.

10:49
Or a combo of both. Because we are. We have some =
mini scripts on the order management and sourcing side that are going to =
run, you know, through TOSCA to produce the outputs for validation.

11:04
Okay.

11:04
But then they also, you know, those cat, those guys in =
sourcing them using source and as an example, because we've got them pegged=
 as a hybrid. Right. They have things that they're going to be doing, you =
know, with external Tools like.

11:20
Oh yeah, they'll have to give to =
other vendors or third party.

11:24
Yeah, they're going to be buying =
something, you know, through I value, you know, and that's not. TOSCA is =
not going to automate external communications.

11:34
Okay. Okay, so that may be one step or it's an entire script that's just a =
manual.

11:44
Yep. Four or five T codes or something like that, you know, =
to produce the purchase, order out to the vendor and then vendor pays us =
and we book the revenue.

11:56
Okay. Okay. All right, so I think we'll =
have that granularity in JIRA that, that says, okay, this script, you've =
got 26 scenarios in order management. You know, 15 of them were automated. =
Nine of, you know, the other 11 were, to your point, manual scripts. And =
then these paths fail. These, these were run output was what was expected, =
etc.

12:23
Yep.

12:24
Okay. All right, so Mac, then we can take that to =
understand. So I think then we. Yeah, so then how do we. And then if I =
understood you right, you will take those outputs from JIRA and, and work =
with Audrey to put it in your sheet. And so we should use your sheet as a =
source to get that data for us.

12:49
If it's only three days. If JIRA is =
gonna be stood up in three days, we can take a screenshot of it and =
summarize and replace it with the JIRA table wise output similar to =
Srinivas's after Wednesday.

13:07
Right.

13:10
Well, Paul, Bill has the =
same thing with Srinivas, the Excel that he was sharing.

13:16
Oh, down to the pivot view.

13:19
Yeah, that's okay.

13:21
Well then, yeah, sure. Yeah, then we'll ingest both. You're right, Rakesh.

13:25
And then that's probably easier for you guys to ingest than logging =
into JIRA and trying to extract the results.

13:31
Definitely.

13:33
It's a lot harder. I don't want to spend time waste time training you guys =
on it if you're not already.

13:39
Right, right, right.

13:41
So that's what we'll do.

13:41
Okay, so then, yeah, we just have to set up=
 that cadence with you and Audrey on getting this info and working through =
that.

13:50
Oh, we'll get it though. She's so much better at these things =
than I am.

13:59
Sounds good. Okay, so I think we have a plan. I know =
Jessica's focus. I have to step away. You're back.

14:10
No, no, no, I'm here. I just have to unmute because we had a meltdown.

14:17
My grandkids were here last week and boy, I was right in the middle =
of a presentation. One of the little girls hit the Other one in the head =
with a shoe. And the screaming was the nine year old hit the seven year old=
 and it was on like sorry, people, but you could. You know what I'm talking=
 about though, Jessica, right?

14:34
Yeah.

14:35
That.

14:35
That is my life these days. I right now have a crying 3 year old in my lap.=
 Although he's calmed down. Yeah. So two quick questions and then we can =
jump. First one is this is for you, Srinivas, that email exchange about the=
 tollers. Do we need to get on a call with them? Because they're looking to=
 like do some external testing and I don't know if that was ever inspecting=
.

14:56
Yeah.

14:59
I think Bill can comment.

15:04
I don't really understand everything they're talking about, to be honest =
with you. It's the last sort of communication from Go was like they're =
going to testing on both colors and 3pls.

15:18
Yeah.

15:20
I'm not sure how they do that. So that's my next question. And then this, =
you know, how can we assist you with this testing? What do we need to do? =
You know, they're speaking Greek to me. I mean, I really don't know what =
that means. I just got back from the doctor.

15:35
Let's maybe. Maybe we do need to have a connect.

15:39
Yeah. All right. I think it wouldn't hurt to have a connect because when I =
was reading it, what it sounded like was there wasn't. My figure could do =
their own level of testing, but they actually needed the three pl and the.

15:56
External.

15:59
Tempting, which I did. When the email chain got =
kicked off, I sent a team message over to Paul, but I'm probably going to =
include him in the meeting was like, hey, if we're doing anything external,=
 do we. Is there any other entity like commercial legal that we should be =
getting involved? You know, internal. It's a very different situation than =
when you're presenting something externally and it's like 150 people. So =
I'll set up a poll so we can all get on the same page. Because if we need =
to do any level of external testing, I think that we. There may be other =
entities that we need to get involved in this just to make sure we're on =
the same page. So I'll get that call set up.

16:44
And when they said it, you know, again, I'm not 100% sure they meant me.

16:50
Maybe it's a. It's vocal.

16:52
Just because some of these guys are =
like embedded it, you know, inside of the plants.

16:57
Yeah.

16:57
Brian Davis and the.

16:59
Yep.

17:00
Okay.

17:01
Precisely.

17:02
Yeah. So I'm just getting all of them on The. Well, we'll see how that goes=
. I'm gonna set something up for probably Monday. The second thing is. This=
 is more a question for you, Rakesh, but Srinivas created his own version =
of the weekly tab in his file. And I'm thinking instead of me integrating =
it into one that I created, maybe just call out that there's separate tabs =
for the finance non ERP and the ERP and just have it that way. I don't know=
 if it's worth me spending a couple hours to format it. If we have them in =
the roughly the same format, just slightly different. As long as we have =
that all out there.

17:43
So what then I'm just wondering what will get =
published today or sent out. Is it just a couple of links we say here, here=
 or we just put it in two tabs I think. But put it in two tabs.

17:57
That's what I'm thinking. Put in second tab. But the schedule going out =
today is really just going to be this weekly one.

18:06
Is it?

18:06
I thought we were looking at the hourly.

18:10
We can send out the ones =
for sit.

18:13
Yes, yes, yes for sit. Yeah.

18:15
Okay, so send that out.

18:20
So even situation. I guess you have it in a separate tab there. =
Srinivas, I think you have. You have an Sid 1 and 2 and then UAT you're =
working on. Yeah.

18:32
The unit testing SID schedule is the same UAT SIP =
that you can use the.

18:38
Yes.

18:39
UAT remote and UA downside and =
what you are.

18:42
Okay, see I can just make sure the name is consistent.=
 But I'm thinking that we. I just pull them in. Maybe the first few tabs =
are bills, the second set of tabs are screening boxes. I don't know that we=
 need to pull them into the same setup. Like the same.

19:01
Particularly if they're not the same users.

19:04
Yeah. Because I'm =
thinking what we could do during the scrum is kick it off and let's say =
focus like piece of the agenda. One is really. And then each one we just =
look at the separate tab all in the same file. So I'm just going to copy =
paste what we put together in my file. Note on there which one's still the =
work in progress. But I'm thinking just it's a little bit of a time =
efficiency but putting it in there because he's copied in a lot of the same=
 formatting. So it's very, very similar. The only thing I would do also =
note in here he has ist, which I understand. I'm just going to also put an =
EST wrong.

19:42
Okay. Okay, now you Brought up the Tola portal and =
external. I think those schedules we should also include. Start including =
them because that's outside of ISE erp. I mean, it's ise, but it's outside =
of ERP Finance. So we probably need to then get with Gokul to understand it=
 may be one of those 34 adjacent apps, but they may have a different test =
schedule within that same seventh to the 18th.

20:11
Yeah. Which is why I think we need to have another conversation. Just have =
this conversation with the. The team on that email.

20:17
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think Gokul is the right person to do that for sit and =
Sriram for uat. But yeah, I think we need. We need to have one with both.

20:29
Okay, I'm gonna. Two separate calls.

20:33
You're thinking no, one =
call is good.

20:36
Got it.

20:37
All right, I'll set up the call Monday.

20:39
Yeah. With everybody on that email chain. If there's anybody that =
you think needs to also be on that conversation that wasn't on the email =
chain, just let me know.

20:47
Okay.

20:49
Okay. So, yeah, you know, I'm =
gonna just pull in Trini Boss's tabs. It'll also make it easier because if =
he needs to make a change to his, he can do it and then we can pull it in =
versus just trying to manipulate.

21:02
Manipulate it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:05
And I don't think anyone's going to have a call out to that. Even if =
they do, I can always combine it later. But I think it's just more. They =
wanted to know that we actually had something like this.

21:12
Yeah, we'll just. Yeah, we'll just rename the tabs accordingly. SIT Finance=
. Sit erp.

21:18
Exactly.

21:19
And then sit outside that supply chain, =
whatever it turns out.

21:24
Yeah. And I'll color code them. I like that =
his are blue. I'll give a bill a color. Maybe bill, I'll make yours pink.

21:31
I appreciate that.

21:33
Bubble gum.

21:36
Right? Okay, so I think =
we're good. I have my running orders for what I need to finish for the rest=
 of the afternoon. And just an FYI for everyone, we have a connect in the =
morning with people, Pierce, to get him up to speed. Our plan is to have =
Pierce do the kickoff meeting on Tuesday. If he does not feel comfortable, =
then I will jump in. But because I'm on vacation, I think it makes more =
sense for it to be him. So we're going to get him up to speed on Monday and=
 then we'll have another discussion Monday morning. Just to kind of =
finalize some of the discussions around the manual versus automated. And it=
 maybe it's Rakesh, I know we were talking about maybe separating those. I =
wonder if it's maybe to like Bill's point, just some kind of quick high =
level summary in total like 160 of these 60 in total are automated. 100 or =
manual. And this is how many we've gotten through some visibility into that=
 data I think is what he's looking for. So maybe we just start with the =
simple end of it and if he wants even more we can.

22:47
So I think Bill had that Bill said in your JIRA instance, you will do that.=
 In the meantime I'll work with you, Bill and you and Audrey. So on these, =
if you have you know, in your sheet, you've certainly got like 14 for =
sourcing and 20 something for this. Is there a breakdown you can provide =
further on those 25 or 26 that are the are manual? Like which one's a =
manual? Which like give me just a count.

23:17
It's in the sheet there.

23:19
No. So okay, Mac, show that sheet. So I want to make sure that we =
talk through your existing smack. If you don't mind pulling that ERP sheet =
Or I can pull it here on the tracker ERP test script Tracker. Okay, sorry.

23:39
Can you see my screen?

23:41
No.

23:51
Okay, let me share my. Let =
me share my screen and I think you all can see it. So there's is that this =
metrics.

24:01
That's they'll go to the first one.

24:03
You had unit testing.

24:06
Yeah, that's all the automated scripts right =
there.

24:09
Ah within these. Okay. Okay so 27. So what I can do then is =
UAT test cases summary. I think I have it open. Oh this is om. Okay. The =
view A read only copy. Okay so I updated this based on your numbers. So =
what I was looking for is you've said tosca fully automated Auto management=
 five Manual. Manual. So I would just correlate it with this where you've =
got so sales order process. So where would I take that in here you don't =
necessarily call out sales order.

24:58
Sales order. Yeah, look at the =
very first line.

25:01
Okay.

25:02
Column D. Okay.

25:03
Okay. So these are the automated ones. Okay. All right, all right, all =
right. So what you have is you automated. So I'm just going to say what you=
 have in that sheet is this. What you have here is fully automated. Now =
what do you mean fully automated and manual. This is the one you said =
sourcing that they'll have to go to a third party or, or go outside after =
the result is there they'll have to give it to somebody. Right.

25:23
Like the PO Creation creation in Ariba. We can't automate that because =
that's a, you know, it's a sidecar application. And Tosco is only =
automating SAP processes. Okay, so everything you see above, so asset PO =
and SAP all the way to Ariba, those are manual.

25:46
Asset PO in SAP. Okay, so everything above this is manual. Yeah, got it. =
Okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna call it in a different color. Okay.

25:59
And then, and then contract creation, company code X, Y and Z down there. =
We're doing all that with Tosca.

26:06
So even asset po.

26:07
No, asset PO goes with the other color.

26:09
Okay, so that, and then this=
 I'm going to call out as, I don't know, neon green. So it's good color. =
Yeah. Okay, so that's automated. Okay, so that's the split partial.

26:25
Your yellow is manual and your green is fully automated.

26:29
No, no, no, no. I think I'm just going to make them. I'm just going to make=
 them like that. So here, they're all the same. Okay, so these are all. And=
 then obviously these are all manual. So I'm just gonna do this for them. =
Okay, no, never mind, never mind. Oh, man, I've got my colors mixed up. =
Okay, these are all manual. These are all automated.

26:59
Correct?

27:01
And then here. Manual, manual, manual, manual. Okay, so all of these are =
manual, which will end up with this color.

27:15
In the green one. Will =
you scroll up real quick in that green one, Those numbers separated by =
commas, is that like. Can we count test scripts by doing like here commas.

27:28
You've got them here.

27:30
Okay, so. Yeah, so.

27:32
Yes, so I guess so. So sales, auto, process, create po.

27:38
Okay, yeah, there's numbers.

27:39
Then map. Create PO output. Create a =
contract. We should just go back in here and say sales order, process, =
contract creation and then create po.

27:53
You can put it in the bottom =
under the TOSCA section here. Create PO output.

28:01
Okay.

28:02
Across all, rename reuse companies.

28:04
Okay. And those are like nine of=
 them or 27 of them.

28:08
Nine. It'll give me 27.

28:11
Okay. Okay, so that, that is the other automated. Right, so, okay, so =
you've got nine of them there, some men, some here, and five of these. And =
together they all form the 21 that you have here.

28:33
27.

28:33
20, 27. Did I get my numbers wrong? 27. Okay. All right.

28:39
Nice.

28:41
That is kosher. Okay, so, but again, I think the point, Jessica, we =
mentioned is that the first few days we'll take that in the tracker and =
then say what's manual, what's not and report on it. And then once a jira =
instance picks up. I guess regardless of if it picks up, you will still use=
 the tracker you've created. We'll just lift information from there. So.

29:07
Yeah. All right, this is so I need a drop.

29:11
Yeah.

29:12
And Bill and Srinivas just want to say thank you so much for your hard work=
 on this. I know that it's been fast paced and a lot of work and we really =
appreciate it because that view right there is really great. That's exactly=
 what we needed. So thank you.

29:24
Oh, you're welcome. It's kind of you =
to say.

29:26
No, thank you. Yeah.

29:27
Appreciate the feed.

29:28
Echo, echo you Bo. You know, Mac, more. Thank you again for all of us.

29:33
Thanks guys. Have a great weekend.

29:35
Yeah, you too. Unless I =
ping you on a Sunday night.

29:38
So I won't respond.

29:39
I'll ping you on Saturday morning.

29:42
Answering me, you know, that's a =
different question. You know, I'm free to ping, so.

29:46
Okay.

29:47
See you guys.

29:47
All right, take care.

29:48
I'm not expecting any.

29:49
I am just.

29:50
Okay.

29:51
No, no, I won't, I won't.

29:53
No, no, no. Yeah, you can reach out. Thank you.

29:56
Bye.

29:57
Thank you.

29:57
Hey, Mac.

29:58
Yeah.

29:59
I sent you the. The two =
files from Paul. One with a password and the other one with a password =
protected.

30:05
Got it.

30:06
So if you can run the pivot.

30:10
Yep. For now. Do you want to create a. We could create a view from that =
test data like a new page rather than add it to your dashboard. Let me just=
 share.

30:23
Yeah, let's do that. I have to get on this other call of =
three.

30:29
Okay.

30:29
Oh no, we have our end of stuff. We have our end=
 of day. Let's can connect after that.

30:33
Okay.

30:34
Okay.

30:35
Okay. Thank you, Rakesh.

30:36
Thanks. Talk in a bit.

you recall, Jeff mentioned this morning that he would like us to delineate =

perspective and provide reporting along that as well as defect tracking =
along that. We&#x27;re trying to see if that makes sense or if there&#x27;s=

we just need to understand better of what part of these things are manual. =

up to speed on Monday and then we&#x27;ll have another discussion Monday =
morning. Just to kind of finalize some of the discussions around the manual=

 160 of these 60 in total are automated. 100 or manual. And this is how =
