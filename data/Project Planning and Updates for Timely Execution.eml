Transcript:
0:00
You are now connected. You can merge your calls when ready.

0:41
Hey Mac.

0:49
Hey Todd. Hey Rachel. Yeah, they should be joining.

2:28
Nick.

2:33
It.

3:06
Hello? Can you hear me?

3:09
Nick? Will we get Anthony do you =
guys think or should we just go ahead and jump into the agenda Nick you =
outlined?

3:25
Not sure about Anthony but yeah, I think we can, we can =
just dive in. So I think so Todd and Rachel, just before you do that Rachel=
, can I pull up the actual agenda page? Well I created a page for it if you=
 let me share I can just share.

4:04
Okay.

4:05
And I'll trade back with =
you. Let me know what you can do this.

4:16
Yeah, we can see it.

4:18
Yep. So I know Rachel Tada had sent this over this morning. I guess you =
know if there are no qualms then I think this would be an effective use of =
our time. So I saw Rachel you had already pulled up the project plan and so=
 we could talk about the project plan. I think there were some open actions=
 from Tuesday that Mac documented. I had to miss that call because of my =
doctor's appointment and so I know it's specific to Rockford but just to =
clarify some of the open actions, there may be some for Bangalore as well. =
And then I think we could use some time to talk about the comms plan. You =
know I think we can talk about at least the content that we want to =
generate and then if we want to pass that off to. I think her name is Heidi=
, if that's the right approach but I'll stop there. Let me know if y'all =
think that this makes sense or how do you want to use the time?

5:16
Yeah, I think that's good. I think the project plan should be the bulk of =
it and then you can leave the remainder for the comms and also maybe Bruce =
getting an update from you on how the project copying is going.

5:39
Any issue passing back to you Rachel?

5:49
Well first before I share Bruce=
. No, you're good. Do you want to just kind of catch us up on what's going =
on with the kind of technical side of things?

5:58
Okay. I got an email from Shankara this morning with a sample project that =
he would like me to start importing. So I'm going to check that out and =
start the copy process on it and when that's done I'll send some links out =
for everyone to try it out.

6:17
Do we know. Go ahead Rachel.

6:20
Sorry, I was going to say that that's the item right here in our workplace.=
 Identify a sample project Bruce. Does that contain links to outside =
projects? The one he sent you.

6:32
I have not been able to look at it =
just yet. I got it this morning and I had some outlook issues early am.

6:42
No worries.

6:46
Is there is our goal though, Bruce, to have this =
test though to be a more complex example? I know like we did a test earlier=
 with one that was pretty much, I'll call it all encapsulated within a =
single project. Are we hoping that this one here has got references outside=
 to other projects so that we can see. Let's just say a project that we've =
got identified as common, but it's got a reference to something that's =
actuation. But they don't get. Do we that. Will that allow us to validate =
that? Yep, the links are broken and how that will behave?

7:19
Yeah, if it, if it does have that kind of data, those kinds of links, it =
would validate that. I'm not sure if it has that just yet. Okay, we'll get =
it copied and I'll start looking at that and then I'll ask those specific =
questions to Dankar.

7:38
And I guess my question is as far as the this =
copy, is it common projects, entangled projects, actuations only. Do we =
know kind of the content of the copy? Bruce?

8:00
I'm sorry. I'm scanning =
this email to see if he has any of this information listed. It doesn't =
appear that he has any of this. So I'm not sure what this data is. It =
actually appears in a sandbox, so I'm not sure if it contains any valid =
data as far as actuations.

8:25
So can you repeat that last bit? You're a =
little far away from the microphones for me. I couldn't hear that last =
piece. I'm sorry.

8:34
It looks like this data resides in the sandbox in =
the Indian Polarian instance. And that means that if it's in the sandbox, =
it might not even be valid data or real actuation data or Collins data. =
Just a test bed area. I'm not sure what this data is right now.

9:01
And so I guess that's a good question, right? Should we be testing =
production data or the sandbox data? Okay. Do you have an opinion either =
way? I think with where we're at, I think if we could get production test =
copies, that would be great. But what's your.

9:25
I agree. That's what I expected.

9:27
Okay.

9:29
The expectation was that=
 the link that they would provide or the project that they were going to =
provide was going to be a project that was a believe we call it entangled. =
That would include actuation data and Collins data. And I was under the =
impression that they were going to give US a project name. Gopi would look =
at it, he would tell us which work items would need to be removed. And from=
 there we were going to test this copy process again.

10:05
Yeah, that sounds. It's exactly what I would think your.

10:10
Expectations are, right, Bruce? I don't know, but it sounds like we kind of=
 have a miss from Shankar side as what he provided. Is that true?

10:18
Yes, that sort of sounds like.

10:20
Okay, maybe we need to validate with =
Shankar with what he provided first before we even spend your time making a=
 copy of it. I don't know. I don't want you to go through an effort of =
making a copy of a project then have the realization that, oh my God, =
that's garbage data.

10:35
Right.

10:35
We're not going to get any value =
out of it.

10:39
All right. Yeah, I'm glad someone else noticed.

10:42
Yeah, I. I mean, I wanna. I wanna make sure we're spending our time wisely =
because we got enough crap on our plates. Right. So let's make sure we set =
our expectations to Shankar clearly is what we need from a project =
standpoint. And then let's get that verified with Gopi if possible.

11:02
All right, I'll reply on this one. I believe Max on it as well. I'll state =
what we were expecting.

11:14
Sorry about that. If you want to CC Todd, =
Nick and I as well. That way we can make sure that we're all aligned across=
 the board.

11:23
Certainly will. Thank you.

11:25
Thank you. Appreciate it.

11:27
Yeah. And Bruce, I don't. I don't have a =
Collins address yet, but I can give you UI address. I just put it into the =
chat.

11:38
All right, thank you.

11:40
Thank you.

11:45
All right, so anything else to kind of call out next up? Bruce will reach =
out to getting more of the right project we're looking for in order to make=
 sure we're able to identify a project with links outside of it.

12:07
Yeah.

12:08
All right, awesome. And then going back up here. So Bangalore,=
 column 5 to validate project dispositions. NC Mac, where are we at with =
that? I know activation went through and took initial disposition, but has =
GOPI said that they. Columbus agrees.

12:33
I haven't spoken to Gopi. And =
these TBDs, is that so? Bangalore. That's GOPI right there in that tbd. Is =
that right?

12:49
I'm into the understanding, yes.

12:52
Okay.

12:54
Yeah, I just feel like we need to fine tune this project plan right now =
because if we're looking at it, a lot of things are overdue and once it =
gets put up into the capital edge side of things, this will get forecasted =
to Despina Jason, and we do not Want to be showing benefits. Yeah. Seven =
overdue items. We're going to get burned. So I've been. I've been given the=
 deadline by tomorrow to upload it to Capital Edge. So we need to be either=
 changing these dates to something that's more accurate or figuring out how=
 we can get on schedule here.

13:33
Yeah, I think that makes sense. And so=
 outside of the tactical closing out of these items, because I think we =
need the stakeholders on the call. Unless obviously someone on this call =
knows, but I feel like we need them to verify their status. We can use this=
 time to verify the dates because I know these dates are influx until =
tomorrow. Right. And so I think we have the opportunity to update these if =
we want to give more time for certain things. Do we want to start with =
Rockford first and then go into Bangalore? And just to. Just to clarify, so=
 these red items, I forget why we made these red.

14:32
I'm not sure who made them red.

14:35
Okay, I think we can remove the =
formatting from that entire column. I think we can remove formatting from D=
 and E just so it's clear. You can remove the bolds too. I was slightly =
confused as to what they were. They were meaning.

14:54
I think bold is critical path.

14:58
Right, I think I did that. But we've =
got column C and then the yellows and owner as well. Like those hotkeys, by=
 the way. All right. And so if we remove the complete items and then. Okay,=
 these are in order. Okay. So validation of project dispositions. We'll =
have. We have that call this team this afternoon. I know I just said get =
rid of the formatting, but we could confirm that with Adam that he can do =
that by tomorrow. And I'd make it yellow because it's something we have to =
confirm with them.

15:59
What. What meeting is that? This afternoon.

16:02
So valerian.

16:07
Yeah, 12:30.

16:08
Okay.

16:08
Sorry.

16:11
Yeah.

16:11
All right, I'm in there.

16:12
Okay, no worries. And of =
course if any of this was answered on Tuesday, let me know. I forget, but =
did we get the sample Polarium project name or sample plan? Project rather.

16:32
Not that I know, Mac. It's hard because I don't know if there's been=
 other emails that have gone around. Have we gotten anything?

16:42
So for Rockford, Rockford, they want to.

16:45
Use the same project that =
has that Bruce already copied. I think Herman is from the Rockford =
Conversation two days ago.

16:58
But that one doesn't have links to an =
outside project.

17:01
Right, but I don't think that in Rockford they are =
using Polarian to the same degree that they are in Bangalore. So I Don't =
think that they're are any projects that they identified, at least from my =
notes that had those like externally linked, like work items to test.

17:23
So is this line item kind of.

17:25
Void then I would leave, I would=
 leave it. And then, I mean we need to just document that comment that =
there are no links to outside projects or work items.

17:46
Do we need to do it separate from both Rockford and Bangalore though? I =
mean, if Bruce is going to get a project from Shankar.

17:52
Right.

17:53
With this same scenario, why would we need to perform for both locations if=
 it's the same operation?

18:00
That's a Bruce question. I think. Bruce, I=
 think once the process is.

18:09
Vetted, we don't need to do it twice. My=
 understanding was that Rockford engineers weren't really using Valerian =
and they didn't have projects that needed to be copied.

18:23
I just feel like the. An entail project, regardless of where it is, will =
have the same process that we need to take and do to separate the data. So =
again, preventing ourselves from duplicating effort. If we can validate a =
project separates correctly from Bangalore, same thing would work from =
Rockford. That's kind of my thoughts.

18:49
I agree.

18:51
Yeah. Okay. So Rich, I think that's the note. And then I think we close us =
and just make it complete.

18:59
So there's. So sorry, go ahead. Is that =
Todd?

19:05
I was gonna say just put it. Put a note there saying that =
we're going to rely on the process being validated from a Bangalore project=
. And as far as you know, you had a statement there about not having any =
projects entangled projects from Rockford. I think we can validate that at =
the call this afternoon. And if that's the case, then we have. Then we have=
 a double whammy of, okay, we're not only going to validate with a =
Bangalore project, but, oh, we don't have this use case in Rockford to =
begin with.

19:42
Yeah.

19:43
So I'm going to put it right here on the =
actuation to validate project positions. Are there links to outside =
projects? Is the question, Is that correct?

19:53
Yeah.

19:58
And that's pretty much the update that we're looking for from Rachel =
Gallagher today on the call this afternoon. She, I think has completed the =
tagging in that Excel file and we'll just look to Rachel to give us a =
breakdown of like what she found based on the interviews that she had. I =
think that she talked to the India folks as well. And that's going to be =
the question. But to the earlier point, just to circle back on that, once =
we validate this process Once it's going to be the same. So I think that =
it's fine to proceed with the test of that project that we got from Shankar=
 this morning of the entangled one in the sandbox and let that be our, like=
, validation test for does this work? And then we'll have the approach =
finalized. And if Rachel Gallagher and the Rockford team do find any =
entangled projects, we'll just apply this approach now, knowing that it =
works.

20:53
Yeah. Matt, just remember she told us when we met with her on=
 Tuesday afternoon, she won't be there on Thursday, but she's completed her=
 portion.

21:01
Okay, that's fair. Yeah.

21:10
All right, next one. =
Confirming naming convention for Rockford Polarian copies. That was =
something we posed to them, but we haven't heard any opposition or pro. =
Right?

21:26
No.

21:30
I think the date is good, though. So 21 tomorrow =
for that one is good. We got nine minutes left. I do want to go through =
these dates really quickly. I think we don't have time tomorrow, but Happy =
to get more or even this afternoon, but. Okay. So validating project =
disposition. So I see Amanda. Is that still Amanda or is that Rachel =
Gallagher?

22:02
I think you can keep Amanda's name down, but it's going =
to be Rachel Gallagher actually executing.

22:08
I put Rachel Gallagher =
then.

22:10
Yeah.

22:21
A draft comes. So that's not going to be tomorrow=
. So drafting comms. Because I think something Anthony wanted to do is have=
 that by next Friday. Aligning the comms with leadership. So that's four =
days. So I think we give ourselves to Wednesday the 26th for comms.

22:56
So, Nick, to make sure we drive that, do you want me to set up with Heidi, =
you, me and Todd, time to kind of kick this off or exclude Heidi and just =
the three of us meet to kind of move this needle a little bit.

23:10
Can you remind me of Heidi's role? I'm sorry?

23:13
She's the overall comms vocal for Redwood.

23:18
Okay, then. Yeah. So she =
would be the leadership piece. So she would be row 30. Right.

23:24
Well, that leadership. DTSMO.

23:27
Yeah, I guess. I guess. I think our =
leadership would be DT and then however DT wants to work with enterprise. =
That's great. So I don't know which layer Heidi sits in. Is she DT or she =
Enterprise?

23:46
Not sure how.

23:49
I mean, I just don't know the =
structure. Like. So is she within dt? Like DT comm.

23:55
Yeah.

23:56
Or do comms for DT and then, you know, HR and whoever else she.

24:01
She probably drafts up the communications then to the impacted users. Is =
that right, Rachel?

24:06
Yeah.

24:08
Is she leadership or is. Is she.

24:11
No, no, I think what we, I think to, to Rachel's point, the, the, the=
 leadership would be. Jason, Tori, just to make sure that we don't send out=
 a communication. They come back and ask what the hell was that all about? =
We were, we didn't approve you guys to, to make those changes yet or =
something like that. Right. Or to make sure we had the right details in the=
 message. Right, got it.

24:33
Okay. So. Yes. So then. Yes, let's work =
with Heidi then. I, I didn't because what I wanted to. What I didn't want =
to bring in leadership into the sauce she's making.

24:45
Yeah, no, no, I think.

24:47
Okay, I'll, I'm going to take a note. I'm =
going to set up time either tomorrow or Monday to move this with Heidi. =
Todd, are you more freed up now or is things still crazy on your head?

25:02
Yeah, right.

25:03
It's, it's, it's getting worse by the hour, I =
swear to God. So.

25:07
Oh, words.

25:07
Shoot.

25:08
Okay, so just find a spot. My calendar. Throw something in there and we'll =
see how I can make it work.

25:16
Okay. When in doubt, me and Nick can run=
 with it with Heidi and just kind of put you in for visibility if you can =
make it.

25:24
Yeah. And then for your row 30, that start date, well, they=
 can overlap but I guess if this is going into capital edge, I don't want =
any confusion. So I would put the start for row 30 is the 26th. And then do=
 we feel confident we can be done by next Friday for this one? Are we gonna=
 get sign off from Jason and Despina?

25:51
Mike. What my question be, =
what's. What's the rush? I don't think we need to get the communication =
stuff all signed off until our T's are crossed and I's are dotted until we =
completely actually understand the process for these intertangled ones. =
Right. And, and the common ones. Right. Because that's really going to be =
the, the parts where the users are impacted.

26:17
Yeah, I agree. If you scroll down a little bit and so where is. Okay, I =
don't see any more. Okay, comms team. So row 72. I think Anthony wanted to =
share comms out by the end of the month and so that's where the rush comes =
from. Todd. So you see that start date as 3 31. And so I think we can push =
that start date at least one week to give us some time and say that the =
reason is because we want to be buttoned up and to get leadership buy in =
before we do that. And it's going to take more time.

27:06
Well, yeah, and, and we need to know what we're gonna have to put in for =
details of that message. Right. And until we know how an entangled project =
is going to look when we make a copy of it and separate all out, it's going=
 to be hard to put that information into a message.

27:23
Yeah, I agree with, I agree with that. And so, you know, I'll, I'll take =
the, the Anthony flag for pushing these back out, but. So our test =
validation is really that point in time where we're a little bit more =
confident on the outputs. Right. And so I'm trying to scan. So 49 and 50 =
user validation of test copies is not until mid April. And so if we say we =
share comms. Oops, did I lose everybody?

28:09
No, you're here.

28:10
Oh crap. Okay. I don't know what happened. My screen went blank. So right =
now we've got sharing comms as the 31st user validation, the 11th, 10 =
business days apart. Those dates, those dates need to be in sync and I =
don't see a middle ground.

28:47
We've got the user, we've got the user =
validation piece for Rockford on the 4th to the 11th, right?

28:59
Yeah. And then we've got Bruce finishing the copies by the fourth. So that =
gives them a week to do validation.

29:06
Well, but to me we gotta do a =
communication way before we do any of that stuff. Right?

29:13
So we gotta do the communication before we do the testing.

29:16
Well, we need to do the testing first before we do the communication.

29:22
Right, I agree. They should be as close as possible. Yep.

29:27
To know we need to put in the message now to max point that we don't even =
know what, what we have from a. We'll have a better idea after our call =
what we have from a data footprint when it comes to Rockford. Right. I mean=
 they might, we might not have any common projects. I don't even know. Or =
if they, or if they do give us a common project, is there a reason why we =
couldn't do it? Do a test copy next week and haven't validated. Right. Do =
that test really easily because that shouldn't be a difficult thing to do =
if it's common. Right. Validate it and then we create the communication for=
 it.

30:12
Well, just. I like, I like where you're going. Bruce, can you =
stay for like five more minutes past time?

30:18
Yeah, I think so.

30:22
On that theme, Rachel, can you filter owner column for Bruce? And Bruce, =
we're going to look at your timeline and since we have you on the phone, =
since this is going into Capital Edge tomorrow, these are the dates we lock=
 in. So I would. Yeah, I guess we can do. Can you sort by name in column A?=
 Do Z to A in column A?

30:53
Yes.

30:59
Okay, so Bruce, top half =
Rockford, bottom half, Bangalore. For your Rockford dates, we can just go =
by one, one by one, quickly. So, creating the test copy of the common =
project, do you think the 25th works for you? That is Tuesday.

31:23
Not until we have something identified from Rockford though. Right? There's=
 a prerequisite.

31:29
Yeah, I don't have anything for from then. Also =
I'll be out on Monday.

31:34
Okay, so 25 does not sound great. What about.=
 How long do you need to do that? Just a couple hours. Can we do the 26?

31:46
Yeah, we should be able to do 26. The thing is that they still don't =
have a project for me. They don't get that to me then.

31:53
Yeah, we're pushing them for that by tomorrow. And I mean, of course =
there's a risk for them if they don't get it to us by tomorrow, but they =
should be able to get it to us by tomorrow. So, you know, with your PTO, =
we're just going to move it to 26 or out of office. I hope, I hope it's fun=
. Out of office. Does that work for you for this one? 26?

32:20
Yeah, I believe that. I believe that's fine.

32:24
Cutover approach by separation type. And so I know we haven't talked about =
cutover specifically in detail, but we talked about. Well, I guess we =
talked about cutover as far as access controls for columns and actuations =
and then the actual creation of the test copies. I think the 28th works for=
 that because I think we largely have a cutover approach for each type. Do =
you agree with that, Bruce, or do you still have open questions on cutover?

33:05
No, the only concern I have is it's just unvalidated. There's. I =
feel confident in it, but I feel more confident if we actually had testing.

33:15
Gotcha. Okay, so we might need more time for the cutover approach =
because we don't have a ton of tests done. And so let's do the fourth on =
that one because I know user validation starts the seventh, which means =
your tests should be complete by the fourth. And I don't know why I don't =
see your tests on here. Oh, I see. Okay, the next create test copy =
entangled project. And so we give that to the fourth, which is two weeks =
from now. I think that's also dependent on the dispositions, the project =
disposition.

34:06
So real quick, Nick, the common coffee and the =
Entangled copy are going to be going on simultaneously. Is that correct?

34:18
Per the plan, yeah. So row 27 and 36. So, Bruce, question, Bruce, can=
 you create test copies at the same time? And remember, this is just =
Rockford. We still have to think about Bangalore.

34:41
So if we've got, I can be downloading stuff while uploading a template for =
the creation of another project. Things like that, I can work on different =
things at the same time.

34:54
I just want to validate because once these =
dates get put into Capital Edge, we need to have a reasoning for changing =
them. Otherwise I cannot change them. So I just can't stress that enough. =
I'd rather go as far to the right as we can. Todd's laughing because like, =
like they're locked unless we have like a PowerPoint that we explain why we=
 have to change it. So I'd rather go as far to the right as we can while =
still hitting day one if we get it done earlier. Great.

35:27
Okay. Well, as far as creating these test copies, Bruce, there's a week in =
between the Common project and the Entangled project. You know, if we were =
to meet in the middle and call it the second, I kind of like my dates to =
end at the beginning or end of the week, but, you know, I think that's a =
ton of time for both of them.

35:57
I'm. I'm fine with creating both of =
these. That's not a problem. I don't like attaching dates whenever I'm =
waiting on data, but, you know, if they're supposed to get it to me by =
tomorrow, great. I'm fine with the dates.

36:14
That's super valid.

36:18
Okay, so then, because if we're gonna do that, let's say 326, which is the =
test copy for the Common project. Something was dependent on that. 326. Oh,=
 no, no, it wasn't. That was another task. So that we just moved that =
because of Bruce's pto. And so, I mean, Bruce, I don't want to just make =
this the thing for you, but I would love for both of these to be done. The =
test copies to be done by Monday the 31st. Can we put both of them on =
Monday the 31st?

37:04
Yeah, I'm fine with that. Again, I just, I'm still =
waiting on projects and it seems like we've asked for a while.

37:16
So. Nick, I think that's on us. When we talk to the Rockford team here in a=
 couple hours that we really have to. If we don't have it today, we need to=
 change these dates for Bruce because we don't want to lock in dates that =
we can't commit to.

37:33
I gotcha. Can you put the 30 first for row 27 =
and 36 and then in the notes dependent on the actuations team to identify =
projects? Because I think the 31st is a ton of time. But again, I =
understand your concerns. If they don't give you anything.

38:00
You.

38:01
Know, I mean, they might come back to us and say, you know, we have =
way more work to do. But it gives you a whole week for the copies for both.=
 Also on row 36, Bruce said he could do them concurrently. And could you =
take that note as well? Bruce can do the copies concurrently. And thanks =
for driving, Rachel.

38:25
Yep, no problem.

38:41
Determining this cutover by separation type. I think we just talked about =
that. We're confident in that one. So can you make that one the 31st as =
well? Oh, wait, give me a second. Sorry. Bruce wants the testing. Do you =
want the testing first, Bruce, or.

39:08
I think.

39:09
Yes.

39:11
I think it might be nice if we reorganize this by end date because, you =
know, there's some other ones down here that are on the same timeline.

39:20
Yeah, not sure what.

39:22
Bangalore.

39:24
Yeah, whatever. It's easier for you guys to view, but I just want to make =
sure right now we have it separated with Rockford on top and Bangalore at =
the bottom. But.

39:44
Yeah, let's just keep going from. From the top. So =
I think we're good on creating the test copies, Bruce, we'll come back to =
this. Cut over separation by type. I think that's fine. That's a ton of =
time. And, you know, I think there will be some testing done at least on =
common projects, etc. And tangled projects. They have until the 11th right =
now. And so that's the only gap there. And so if we go into removing =
Collins users and removing actuations users by the 14th, how does that date=
 feel for you, Bruce?

40:27
Rows 40 and 41, that really just depends on =
the number of users. I need to get a list of users that are going to be =
assigned for each project.

40:45
Okay, so here's a list of users. So the =
list of users would come from actuations, right?

41:03
Yes, I believe it would.

41:10
And then columns, users would come from. =
I'm guessing Rachel Gallagher. I mean, who can identify which user is which=
? Like if a user is actuations or if a user is Collins.

41:35
Is there. Is there a role, Bruce, in those projects besides you that can =
remove all of the appropriate people from a project?

41:47
Yeah, the project admins would be able to. So if we had a Collins only =
Project and you owned it. You would be the project, it's called power user.=
 You would be able to go in and remove users yourself. Likewise, I would be=
 able to assign a super user role to a actuation person so that they could =
assign the users that they wanted to in their own project so that they =
could handle it themselves if they'd like or if we want the offload that =
work to them.

42:21
I think that actually makes more sense because they =
know the users more than you do. My thought, your role could be. Because =
right now we have that page out there that shows who has access to a =
project. Right. Couldn't we simply do a query at the end when they say that=
 they're done? So for the, for the columns only and actuations only =
projects, we give those people the roles they need to do this work. They =
tell us when they're done and then our role is to validate that. Yep, the =
appropriate people have been removed. And we can do that via one of those =
queries on that, that Polarian page, right?

42:58
Yeah, it sounds like =
something we should be able to do. The big thing is going to be still for =
validating, we still need to get a list of users.

43:06
Of actual actuation users.

43:11
Yeah, we need their, their login IDs at =
the very least so that we could verify the only access that they would have=
 is to those new actuation projects.

43:22
Okay.

43:23
Wouldn't a simple way to do this is just. I mean, I'm sure there's a list =
of people in perimeter. Right.

43:29
And so if we have that list somewhere=
.

43:32
Yeah, So I mean that would be the actual.

43:35
Yeah, I have the census. That that's what you're looking for.

43:41
Right. And so people. If someone in perimeter, I mean, Bruce, that, you =
know, a ton of those people might not have plarian access at all, but =
anybody on that list should be removed from a Collins project. Right. I =
mean, could you use that? It would be more data than you need. Or even, you=
 know, a super user. We could give them that list as well. But one, I don't=
 know, the sensitivity around the census. And then two, I don't know if =
that's just too much data to be used appropriately.

44:13
What does the data look like? Is it IDs, like what they use to log in or is=
 it first name, last name? If it's first name, last name, that's not usable=
.

44:26
I don't know what the data looks like, unfortunately. I don't know=
 if anyone else does.

44:30
No, I don't. I don't either. But I think =
that's that's kind of the point, right, Bruce, where you don't want to have=
 to do all that manual stuff at least, right?

44:39
Yeah, they.

44:41
They know the people that should have access or not versus you. And at the =
end, we should be able to do some sort of validation to see the people in =
the. We should be able to do some type of an export for each project that =
is said to be going to actuations only to do a spot. Do a check of some =
sort, right. Say, hey, there are no Collins users in that list.

45:06
Yeah, I believe we can make a query that would do that for each project. =
Same for Collins. If we need to remove actuations and we have a list of =
users to bounce it off of.

45:21
I just like putting that effort I just =
like putting that effort on those super users for either columns or =
actuations. Because again, they know the data. Our role is the admin of the=
 system and the repositories.

45:37
Okay, so it sounds to me like. And =
correct me if I'm wrong, I mean, the first step is still to identify the =
list of users, right?

45:48
Are you saying list of users, meaning list of =
testers, Nick?

45:51
No, the list of columns users and actuations users. =
We still need that list, right?

45:58
I don't know if we do, because the =
people that are managing those projects should know who should have access =
or not, Right?

46:06
Yeah, I like that. I think it would be more like =
identifying the leaders for each of the projects.

46:12
Yeah, sure.

46:14
That they have access to remove permissions, for example. And then my role =
would be more along lines of assisting those guys if they need assistance. =
If they, if they've never added a user or deleted a user, I would assist =
them. This is how you do it. Then they go do the work.

46:34
And Mac, isn't that data that Perry kind of pulled together at the =
beginning? Correct me if I'm wrong, Todd. Like, I remember like seeing a =
big list of users that are using. Yeah, I think we have that.

46:46
Yeah. And I think part of the thing that we could do even in this Rockford =
call here at 12:30, is to say, okay, which one of you guys wants to be the =
X on your forehead of removing the users? Right. Because again, if we're =
giving them the responsibility of identifying its actuations or columns, =
they should also be aware of those people that should be able to access =
those projects as well. And it would seem odd to say, hey, Amanda, cool you=
 went and identified all the projects now. Now go find somebody else to =
update the permissions. Right. I mean, they've done a lot of work on the =
data, go ahead and remove the people that should. That shouldn't have =
access. We can then verify at the end that yep, you removed or we can =
verify yep, there's no columns people there. We don't care who from =
actuation side you gave access to. But as long as there's no columns people=
, we're good. But I mean and to me the, the own. I mean for like row 40 and=
 41.

47:56
Right.

47:57
We've got Bruce identified for those. To me that =
would be a project lead or the project super user. Right. We would then =
have a secondary action after that for us to. To. To validate. No columns =
users are in actuations projects and no actuations user in columns projects=
.

48:22
Yeah, I agree with that. So it sounds like how do we identify the =
super users?

48:32
We ask some. We ask the people we're working with. So =
Adam and Amanda, who do you want to be responsible for moving permissions? =
Right. And then the same thing for Bangalore.

48:43
Yeah.

48:43
Then we have to add those tasks. So I would add a row above 40.

48:50
And also Nick, I'm not sure if you have that agenda pulled up for the =
Rockford call, but let's make sure we're taking some notes here of like =
what questions we're asking on that call. So like what Todd just said, =
who's the super user that we're going to have identified? Also making sure =
that they're committing to giving the project to bruises that's applicable.=
 Like, you know, we have to make sure that we're having all of our =
questions documented.

49:17
Yeah, I got it. It'd be super helpful for me =
to get a copy of this too by since I don't have a copy of a copy of the =
plan we're looking at because I don't have.

49:33
Yeah. You said you had =
your interview today. Did that. Okay. So hopefully you'll have access maybe=
 tomorrow or Monday.

49:44
I guess. I don't know how long this process =
takes, but my interview today. But still, I would love to have this because=
 I'm also getting asked by like ey leads on what's going on.

49:57
Yeah, we just don't want to have like multiple different copies floating =
around.

50:01
Oh, I'm not, I'm not. I'm not using in any way that would be=
 bad for this tank. But I, I do need like the latest copy so I can =
reference it.

50:13
So I can send a copy of you after this call. Once we =
add this line item. Does that work?

50:18
Yeah, 100%. And we have to add =
the same line item for Bangalore.

50:23
So what exactly are the line item?

50:27
The line item is identify super users to remove Collins or =
actuations users based on project dispositions. And this one's going to be =
Adam. Sure.

50:57
Or whoever from the Rockford side.

51:00
Yeah. I didn't want to put a tbd, so Adam. And then Adam needs to do that =
by the. I was gonna say the seventh, but.

51:13
We could kind of do that =
next week sometime. That should be. That should be an easy thing to.

51:16
Do the 28th or do the 28th, Rachel. Yeah.

51:24
Because in. In theory, =
Nick.

51:27
Right.

51:27
Let's just say they have that super user as =
they're going through and identifying a project at actuation. They could go=
 in there that same day and remove anybody that they don't know any comms =
person and be done.

51:39
Yeah. And then I'd put not Bruce, but I'd put =
actuations super user. No. And the owner. And the owner.

51:51
Not for 41.

51:53
Yeah.

52:00
Is it going to be. Does it have to be a Collins super =
user for Collins only projects? I mean, I'm sure. Yeah.

52:06
Yep.

52:13
Do we have to go back up and say. And not. Or like identify super users for=
 columns and actuation?

52:26
Well, the question is, is Adam. I mean, I =
guess that would be Rachel then. So we'd need a mirror task and it'd be =
Rachel for Collins. Rachel Gallagher.

52:44
Yeah. I'm just trying to think=
 like, could we just assign it to both them. To both run with rather than =
creating.

52:50
I'd separate it.

52:52
Okay.

52:55
Don't want any diffusion of responsibility. And then Rachel would be =
Collins. And then. So I don't. Yep.

53:18
Well, technically we have two =
activation people right here, so that's what I'm a little confused about. =
We can't let Rachel become Collins.

53:27
I thought Rachel was Collins. Oh=
, so. So it's Amanda. Okay. I thought she was. I. I had. Yeah.

53:37
We need to have.

53:38
Yeah, I think Rachel's going with the deal, isn't =
she?

53:41
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's actuations.

53:44
Make sure.

53:58
She is actuation engineering.

54:01
Okay. And so then it needs to be=
 identify super users to remove actuations for Amanda. And then Adam, =
identify super users to remove columns.

54:19
These actuations too.

54:24
Right?

54:25
Yeah.

54:26
Right?

54:26
Yeah. Adam's gonna. They're gonna =
remove Collins people and then the Collins people are going to remove =
actuation people. Right?

54:32
Yeah.

54:33
Is that the right way to think=
 about it?

54:34
Yeah. Yeah. Correct.

54:35
Y.

54:37
But. And we're confident that Amanda's comms.

54:40
Todd, what's Amanda's last name? I can tell you real quick.

54:44
I think it mentioned Right.

54:47
At least from other conversations.

54:49
Yeah, she's been calling.

54:51
Yeah, she's calling Jill.

54:53
Okay, thank you.

54:57
Great. And so then those people have a week to do =
that first week of April. So that's two weeks from now to start and then =
basically three weeks from now to finish. So I will add that to the agenda =
as far as confirming that date.

55:25
Yeah, I'm looking ahead. Next is the=
 same schedules. It's looking like Amanda and Adam don't have a conflict =
scheduled after hours. So if we have to run longer than a half hour, those =
two can stay. But everyone else has something right at one central. So just=
 something to be aware of while we're like this call, you know, we ran an =
hour, so like making sure we know who could possibly spend.

55:57
Yeah. And I think, you know, I'm going to try to start putting agendas =
together ahead of our calls. And Rachel, Todd, the three of us can put our =
heads together as far as how we want to structure the call. And so we'll =
know ahead of time if we need more time or not because, yeah, it's like =
we're, you know, kind of still drafting the agenda for the call in an hour.=
 Our agenda is growing, but no worries, we're doing great. So let's keep =
looking at. So we need to add the same thing for Bangalore. So above row 65=
, we need to add two for Bangalore.

57:01
We're copying this. I have a =
question. Would they be identifying, like the most used projects so that we=
 could ensure we get those done first in the event that something took =
longer? For example, they have data that they need. They have projects that=
 are actively worked, already copied?

57:26
I mean, that's a good question=
. I don't know if we can get that layer of data right. I mean, it's either =
somebody's opinion, which we could try to get from Adam or Shankar, or =
there's data that says, you know, I don't know, daily active users or =
something like that.

57:48
I was curious because I thought that whenever =
they did the Hornet project, I thought that they were doing it that way and=
 bringing it up. Thank you.

58:00
I mean, one thing we could ask them to =
do is to prioritize it, which is based on their opinion. Right. But I don't=
 know how easy that ask is. How critical is that Ask for you. For you, =
Bruce. I mean, I guess it's about.

58:20
I mean, not really. I'm really =
wanting to try and get everything done in the time frame we have, you know,=
 so that's only if something were to go wrong. Accidents, deaths, like, you=
 know, hit by a bus, etc.

58:38
Yeah, I mean, because we're asking for a =
lot already against a tight timeline. I don't want them to have to say they=
 need someone else to come in and give an opinion on priority. You know =
what I mean? Like.

58:53
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

58:55
Yeah. I mean, if we had like the time to put together a rubric that said, =
okay, this number of users, this dollar amount for the project, you know, =
this timeline, and then, you know, you score it. That's a scientific way, =
which I would prefer, but I mean, good question, but I think we can leave =
it off for now, especially with our scope, because hopefully our scope size=
 decreases based on the feedback we're getting.

59:31
Yeah, I'm not sure, Nick, if you took a peek at Rachel's dispositioning or =
Mac, if you did, it looks like most of it's like columns, so.

59:39
Right.

59:43
Yeah, there's like one comment, right? Todd, there's only like one =
comment. We saw that she said.

59:50
Yeah, yeah, there's only one there. =
So there's not many. So.

59:55
Yeah. And then you're going to do actuation=
 super user and column. Super user for 67 and 68 owners.

1:00:04
Yeah, I need to drop.

1:00:07
Yeah, I need to drop too. Rachel, we'll =
touch base at 12:30.

1:00:11
Yep, sounds good. Thank you both. I =
appreciate.

clarify some of the open actions, there may be some for Bangalore as well. =
And then I think we could use some time to talk about the comms plan. You =

Todd. So you see that start date as 3 31. And so I think we can push that =
