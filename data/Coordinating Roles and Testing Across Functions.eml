Coordinating Roles and Testing Across Functions

- **Main Objectives:**
  - Collect and identify all relevant names involved in the process.
  - Map out the specific roles of each identified individual.
  - Assign coordinators to work with each business function or IT tower (e.=
g., supply chain, finance) to determine testing needs.

- **Process Overview:**
  - Coordinators (like Pierce) are facilitators, =
not sole owners of the process.
  - Coordinators should reach out to =
respective functions (such as supply chain or IT) to:
    - Understand upcoming system and process changes.
    - Collaboratively identify appropriate test scenarios.
    - Return with a list of individuals (names) responsible for =
coordination and testing.
  - Each function may be subdivided into =
sub-functions. For example, Finance might include Treasury, Controllership,=
 or Record-to-Report, each requiring their own test lead.

- **Tracking & Coordination:**
  - A tracker is to be developed to ensure:
    - All relevant function leads and test leads are identified for every =
process or sub-function.
    - Clear mapping between IT towers (also =
referred to as "systems of towers" in Honeywell) and business =
functions/sub-functions.
  - The ultimate goal is to facilitate efficient =
coordination and organization of the testing phase.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Continue discussions to finalize the coordination and mapping of roles =
and responsibilities.
  - Further clarification and follow-up may be needed=
 to ensure comprehensive coverage across all functions and IT towers.

All those names back to us. We need all the names =
identified. We need their roles mapped out. We need them to start driving =
and working with each function or each IT tower, for example, to start =
identifying your scenarios and start setting up testing. Not testing, but a=
 scope of what's to be tested. So Pierce is a coordinator, but he's not the=
 be all and end all of all of these things with everybody. So Pierce can do=
 his best to say it you work streams, go reach out to functions, supply =
chain, it work with supply chain function to understand the scope of what's=
 testing. You've got a bunch of systems that are changing. The function has=
 a bunch of processes that are changing. Go figure out together what needs =
to be your test scenario. Then you can come back and say, okay, these are =
the names that you're going to coordinate with function. You've got a set =
of coordinators. It you've got a bunch of test names. And then we can start=
 working on how do we coordinate the testing. That's his role to do that. =
The tracker. What we're looking to do is to develop precisely that view =
that says, have I identified the names the function leads as well as the =
test leads for every process or sub function. So, for example, Finance. =
Finance may have treasury as a sub function that you need a lead for. It =
may have controllership as a secondary that you may need a lead form, maybe=
, you know, record report some functions within that, some sub functions =
that you may need a view for. Has Finance identified all of those from an =
IT perspective have systems of towers. So the ID towers in Honeywell, =
they're called systems of towers. So the CR thing. Okay, sorry. All right, =
now we'll get there. Let's. Let's continue the conversation in a little bit.
