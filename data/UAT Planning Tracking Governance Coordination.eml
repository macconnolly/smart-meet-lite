UAT Planning Tracking Governance Coordination

# Meeting Summary: UAT =
Planning, Tracking, and Governance Discussion

**Date/Time discussed:** =20
- Tracker to be sent out by tomorrow morning (relative to meeting, specific=
 date not provided)
- Draft slide content/structure for Sukai to be ready =
by Thursday afternoon (relative to meeting)
- Meeting with Sukai scheduled =
for Friday for review/discussion

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Approach and Structure for UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- **Past Experience:** Team intends to share their experience and typical =
approaches to UAT execution, including how coordinators and teams are =
structured, common escalation paths, and frequently used tools.
- **Planned Discussion for Friday:** The team will present slideware to =
Sukai that outlines their methodology for UAT, covering:
    - How UAT is executed at a high level.
    - Details on planning, =
coordination, escalation, and tool usage (such as Jira).
    - Process for readiness and execution tracking.
    - Gaps and areas for improvement identified in current readiness and =
planning.
- **Levels of Tracking Discussed:**
    - **High-Level Tracker:**=
 Tracks what each Honeywell function/employee owes to the program (e.g., =
focal points, test scripts submitted).
    - **Granular Tracker:** Focused =
on alignment of scenarios at the process mapping and script level.
- **Key Metrics to Track (tentative list):**
    - Identification of roles =
and focal points.
    - Submission of test scripts and scenarios.
    - Closure of process mapping to systems gaps.
    - Overall readiness =
for UAT execution.

### 2. Readiness and Gap Analysis
- **Tracker Deliverable:** A readiness tracker to be provided by tomorrow =
morning to give a current state view and support follow-ups.
    - Enables workstream leads to identify missing focal points, pending =
scripts/scenarios, or cross-team alignment gaps.
    - Supports driving =
closure on open items.
- **High-Level vs. Granular Tracking:** Both =
approaches are required:
    - High-level for leadership visibility and =
cross-team accountability.
    - Granular for ensuring actual test coverage=
 and scenario completeness.

### 3. Execution and Escalation Process
- **Drafting of Execution Model (MOS):**=20
    - A high-level draft of the=
 Management Operating System (MOS) for UAT execution is to be developed by =
Thursday for team review.
    - This includes: what happens if issues arise=
, escalation steps, and cross-functional coordination mechanisms.
    - Emphasized need for iterative refinement; initial draft is not =
expected to be final.
    - Inclusion of governance structures and command =
center concepts (the latter to be discussed further in the future).
    - Noted pain point: Historic breakage in coordination from one function=
 to another (e.g., from Finance to IT to HR).
- **Role of PMO:**=20
    - PMO involvement is required to properly govern and align on the MOS =
and key processes.
    - Specific mention of involving Hopkins (from PMO).
    - The approach will be collaborative, not just "handing over" =
responsibilities to PMO.

### 4. Governance, Coordination, and Reporting
- **Governance Structure:**=20
    - Needs clear documentation: roles, =
responsibilities, escalation points, and cross-team alignment.
    - Reference to existing governance/reporting templates (e.g., BRB =
readiness tracker from OPSEP call).
    - Plan to connect with Jennifer =
(PMO) to leverage and adapt these templates for UAT.
- **Reporting and Dashboarding:**=20
    - Will be included in the Thursday=
 draft and refined for Friday's meeting.

### 5. Tooling for UAT Tracking =
and Defect Management
- **Primary Tool:** Jira is currently planned as the =
main tool for UAT defect tracking.
- **Access Concerns:**=20
    - Not all users may have Jira access.
    - Consideration of =
alternative (SharePoint) for those without Jira, to ensure ease of use and =
universal access.
    - Need for training and maintaining consistency in =
defect logging across all functions.
- **Next Steps:**=20
    - Avinash and others to review both Jira and SharePoint options this =
week.
    - Recommendation(s) to be brought to Hopkins/leadership for a =
decision.
    - Documentation and presentation of solution(s) expected this=
 week.

### 6. Hypercare & Cutover Planning
- **Hypercare Not =
Forgotten:**=20
    - Recognized that cutover and ongoing support =
(=E2=80=9Chypercare=E2=80=9D) governance must be addressed after UAT =
planning.
    - IT will play a support (but not leadership) role.
    - Alignment needed with the PMO and the broader business cutover team, =
led by Evan.
    - Importance of not defaulting all hypercare =
responsibility to IT.
    - Desire to raise awareness and be proactive in =
defining roles and responsibilities for hypercare.

### 7. Roles and Distribution of Responsibilities
- **Involving Project =
Managers from All Towers:**
    - Each project manager will be asked to =
track and gather UAT readiness information within their tower.
    - Responsibility is distributed across towers to avoid overload at the =
program level.

---

## Action Items

1. **Readiness Tracker**
    - Distribute high-level tracker by tomorrow morning to enable immediate=
 follow-up and closure of gaps.
    - Tracker to include focal points, test=
 scripts, scenario status, and process mapping completeness.
2. **MOS/Execution Model Draft**
    - Circulate a draft of the MOS for UAT=
 execution by Thursday afternoon to enable review before Friday=E2=80=99s =
meeting.
    - Include governance structure, escalation paths, and =
cross-functional process.
3. **Tooling Evaluation**
    - Review both Jira and SharePoint as defect and test tracker options.
    - Schedule time (this week) for key team members (Avinash, Prakash, etc=
.) to compare tool suitability.
    - Document pros/cons and bring =
recommendations to Hopkins/leadership before end of week.
4. **Leverage Existing Governance/Reporting Templates**
    - Connect with Jennifer (PMO) to obtain and adapt existing BRB =
readiness tracker and reporting templates for UAT.
5. **Weekly/Bi-weekly =
Tracking Rhythm**
    - Decide on regular meeting cadence for program-level=
 UAT status tracking (weekly/bi-weekly), leaning away from monthly =
frequency.
    - Coordinate with PMO on ownership and operating rhythm.
6. **Hypercare and Cutover**
    - Begin documenting IT=E2=80=99s =
recommendations and role in hypercare.
    - Coordinate with Evan=E2=80=99s=
 cutover team and prepare to align with broader program hypercare model.
7. **Documentation**
    - Start drafting documentation for all above =
topics in anticipation of leadership review.

---

## Follow-up

- **Thursday afternoon:** Team review of the tracker, MOS, and draft =
material for Sukai.
- **Friday:** Discussion with Sukai=E2=80=94present =
draft, collect feedback, and clarify expectations.
- **This week:** Tooling=
 review for Jira vs. SharePoint and present findings to Hopkins/leadership.
- **Future:** Further iterations (double/triple click) on the MOS, =
governance structure, and dashboarding as feedback is received and =
processes are refined.
- **Ongoing:** Continue to press for clarity and =
proactive governance around hypercare and cutover support; ensure IT is not=
 defaulted as sole owner.

---

## Additional Notes

- Emphasis on tracking both high-level and granular UAT readiness and =
execution items.
- Strong focus on cross-functional alignment and avoiding =
historic failures in handoffs between functions (e.g., Finance, IT, HR).
- Recognition that training and tool access (especially for defect =
tracking) must not be a bottleneck.
- Commitment that each =
conversation/iteration will move material closer to a Honeywell-specific, =
effective UAT operating model.
- Appreciation for leveraging existing =
tools/templates (e.g., BRB tracker) to ensure familiarity and minimize =
change management issues.

**End of Summary**

Transcript:
0:00
Preferably Thursday afternoon. But our intent on the Friday conversation =
would be to lay out how we've done UAT in the past. Just our experience, =
our point of view on how does UAT execution typically work? How do we want =
to plan for it? You know, how do the coordinators work with each other, how=
 is the mos and the structure set up, how does escalation work? You know, =
and then what, what sort of tools are typically used? In this case, we're =
going with jira, you know, how will that process work? So at a high level =
and a first level double click, that's our intent in terms of the slideware=
 to share with Sukai on Friday. Now, as part of that, I think one of the =
things is how do we want to track stuff? So there's even the readiness =
tracking as well as later on execution tracking. But to the point you made =
earlier on, where are we with the readiness and planning for it? What are =
the gaps today? What meetings have we held? How do we close the gaps on =
identifying or narrowing down the scope? Identifying, narrowing down test =
scenarios, working to identify test scripts. So I think there's a tracker =
we'll get by tomorrow morning to you that should have a view of at least =
the metrics we're tracking to and then get a view of what's there. I think =
that should help you and us drive each of the work streams to say what is =
in play, have you developed the scenarios, have you connected with each =
other, do you know the systems in scope, where are the gaps, etc. So that's=
 what we're thinking as a parallel track. One, to get you that tracker so =
that we can drive closure of that tracker. And two, get the, the content =
for the deck that I suspect will be a double triple click later on next =
week as well. But at least the first step, have the story there and the =
talk track around. Here's how we typically would run UATs and or how UAT is=
 run and all those things I mentioned earlier. So let me take a pause there=
, see if that you're aligned to that thinking.

2:22
Yeah, I mean that comes close to what I was thinking for the way I was =
looking at it was obviously I need two different trackers, right. One that =
we're going to need obviously is on a high level of Honeywell employees and=
 functions in it. What is owed to us as the program. So like the focal =
points, right? Has everybody given us a focal point for it? Have they =
provided test scripts? So at a high level we need a tracker to make sure =
that. Go back to Jeff or sky say, hey, you know, finance owes us a scenario=
.

2:56
Yeah.

2:56
They haven't included the test script. Right. So I need=
 that high level. That way when we need a push, they can all see it. Then =
we, the next tracker is, you know, do we all have those in alignment on the=
 granular level? What are the scenarios for? What does the process mapping =
look like? And now we can do that. And that kind of goes into what you =
talked about, what you guys already have, what you guys have done in the =
past. But I think that's how my brain's looking at it is Those are the two =
levels of the 90. The top level and then the granular.

3:25
Yeah, the top level. We'll get you that tomorrow morning because that is =
part of the workshop follow ups and everything else. So that. Yes, we're, =
we're brainstorming right now just to think of the metrics to track as part=
 of what you said, you know, test. Identifying roles is one, Identifying =
test scripts and scenarios is another. Closing the gaps on process maps to =
systems is another. So there are five or six metrics we need to track to =
closing. So that will get you a view of state of play by tomorrow. So we =
can chase that down. The other part of this is the double click. How does, =
you know if something, and this comes as part of the execution, you know =
that the double click into it as okay, if something is not working. How do =
you, you know, how do you go about discovering it? How do you escalate =
things? I think that will be part of the mos that's, that's also being =
developed.

4:17
And that's what we're going to get like a high level rush =
draft that by Thursday review. I know we won't have a final copy, but =
that's our intent. Right. It's not like a draft of that on Thursday. Yeah, =
we can all kind of brainstorm and make sure it aligns because we did commit=
 to giving them to giving Sakai a rough draft on Friday.

4:35
On Friday, yes.

4:37
Yeah. I told her it wouldn't be finalized because we =
know there's still a lot of work to go through it. But I would like to be =
able to show her a draft of what happens in this scenario and then who is =
in alignment, who we need to coordinate between because that's probably the=
 biggest gap I see within Honeywell. How we're put together is from a =
function to another function. We do not align well, you know, from function=
 to it. We don't align well. You know, there is a better correspondence =
between it and say finance, but if finance has to go to it, then it has to =
go to hr. There's always a breakage there in how money will operate. So =
that's where the coordination and those UAT coordinators and focal points =
are really vital to make this work.

5:18
Yes, totally with you. And I =
think what we'll look to get is a view on how does that stitching and =
coordination work. We can beat up on it and make it Honeywell centric, but =
at least a general guideline or a general process on what happens if things=
 don't work. How is the governance structure and the team structure that =
will be set up to run UAT and potentially command center? You know, how =
will that command center I don't want to bring in yet because there's a =
broader discussion on this whole POS and sos and how that will be cut over =
by the business, etc. But at least for UAT, work through what you're =
specifically asking for there on what happens if something breaks, how does=
 that cross functional coordination work? So that governance structure and =
that MOS and that should help start addressing some of those questions. For=
 Sukhai and Jeff, it will need. To your point, it will need a double click =
or a refinement with several cycles, but at least they can react to that as=
 part of the conversation Friday.

6:25
Yeah, and on that note too, so that=
 the highlights the tracker, how we're going to do with the scenarios. But =
I don't know if we've really thought this as well too. How do we actually =
do this? Right. From a MOS perspective, we know what they are, we know the =
scripts are going to go, but from a program level, we need to be able to =
track it. Right. We need to be able to look at it. So do we hold like a =
weekly meeting on which ones we are? Do we host, you know, bi weekly? Is it=
 monthly? Monthly's too far out. Right. But I don't want to just throw a =
meeting on the calendar for the sake of having a calendar. So we gotta =
figure out a legitimate MOS on how we operate and manage this from a =
program perspective. Right. How do we track and make sure that we're =
coordinating the functions, we're talking to each other, not just when this=
 didn't go well.

7:09
Right, understood.

7:10
And everyone went through =
it. How do we line up for that?

7:14
So some of that we'll have to bring =
in pmo, because I think the expectation as well is yes, there's UAT and =
you'll have the IT UAT coordinator role, but there's a lot of PMO =
governance in here and that structure should help define some of that mos =
for us. So I don't think we can do that in isolation. I think we absolutely=
 need the PMO as part of that conversation.

7:40
Yeah. So we bring in =
Hopkins and we have that alignment. I think we should have some ideals. =
Yeah. I don't want to just throw this over the fence and say, hey, Jeff, =
you know, this is PMO kind of thing. I think we should kind of pitch it =
directly saying, this is where involvement goes. This is where we're going =
to need alignment and support from PMO to make sure that we do this right. =
So I just want to make sure we cover all the bases for any questions that =
might get come up, make sure that we're doing our part from it, but also =
understanding that we're a big wheel on the machine to get moving agreement=
.

8:12
So I think we're aligned. So immediate tracker for readiness and =
where we are so we can drive closure. The other one is the mos and how we =
want to operate this and execute on it. That will come up as part of the =
roles, responsibilities across the teams and where we'll need PMO and =
support there. And then the third part is overall governance structure. =
Double click into how UAT is typically run. What is the. What is the =
governance? What are the processes in play? Now there were some trackers =
from a BRV readiness tracker that a PMO put out in the OPSEP call. So I'll =
connect with Jennifer and leverage some of those in terms of reporting and =
dashboarding that may need to be there for, you know, how this governance =
and process would work. So, so yeah, so I'll. We'll connect with her, but =
we should have a view into that Thursday, or at least her draft and then =
coming into Friday, we should have a view of all of these things that will,=
 that will inform the conversation.

9:20
Okay, so yeah, actually that line=
, because that's what I actually was searching. I was looking for that BRB =
tracker in the background right now because I remember that was a template =
that they already are used to seeing. So keeping similarities is always =
good. The last piece that I have and then we can open to see what else you =
guys have. Was the hyper care. Right. That's not our first priority. We =
gotta get through uat, but I don't want that to drop off. We do need to =
make sure that we get some governance and some, you know, mos and plans =
around that as well.

9:52
Yeah, and that would be. Yeah, so there's a =
portion of it. Again, we need to talk to about cutover and hypercare model =
that the PMO will bring in. And I think that is part of a broader cutover =
team that they're looking to stand up. Evan is looking to stand up and we =
need to align with them on. I get the cutover from an IT perspective and =
you know, the hypercare model from an IT perspective. I think there's a =
broader conversation on having a hypercare model that stood up for across =
the program and particularly around the POSO cutover on all of that =
happening. So we'll need to line up with them or at least align with them =
first on that topic of hypercare as part of cutover and then bring that =
into the conversation with Jeff because that's also a centralized process =
that where IT will have to play a part. But I don't think it will be IT LED=
 per se.

10:53
Yeah, no, that's what I said. When Chicago set up our =
meeting last week, you had that hypercare in the agenda. We didn't really =
go into it too much, but I know it's still in the back of everybody's mind,=
 so I don't want it to get dumped on and say, hey, okay, it, your program =
is going to run everything because that's not the way it should be designed=
 for.

11:12
Yeah.

11:13
So I just want to make sure we're preemptive. =
This area. Here's our recommendations. This is how we're viewing it from =
our side of the house. And then now we can keep a good alignment because =
otherwise it will turn around and get dumped on it. It's an easier =
mechanism for Honeywell and for some of the functions just to give it. Oh =
well, it's IT related. So it's, it's. So I just want to make sure that =
we're diligent about how we handle this.

11:37
Understood. Noted. I'm =
aligned with you on that. Avinash, I know you joined in a couple of minutes=
 late on that. Any questions, clarifications or thoughts from your end on =
some of the conversation here?

11:53
Just curious when Peers and you both =
kind of agreed on it is not an IT job or it is not just it's responsibility=
 out here, but when we talk of UAB on a tools perspective, it is an IT node=
, right? And this. I'm missing something?

12:08
No, no. UAT is as far as =
what we're doing, making sure it works. The scenarios are the =
responsibilities of the functions. So what they test and what they actually=
 make sure works. And then the linkage for it is more on the sip. What we =
were just more linked in was More on the hyperparamet would be more of the =
functions but it is an easy but. So you know, it's always. That's why we're=
 just making sure we're preempting it and talking about it at the time. =
That way we don't get behind the wheel.

12:40
Yeah.

12:41
Just one additional thought process out there is there are assigned project=
 managers for each of the stream of towers within or there are multiple =
project managers depending on which tower you speak to. So if you, if you =
were to ask all these project managers to say hey, go get this information =
mapped out by X date, start with identify the number of test case scenarios=
, identify who the business focus are, who's going to be testing again, =
they can in turn chase the loop within the tower itself and then by when =
are they expected to start whatever as in they could put up that =
information, the project manager should be able to gather that information =
or go figure out who to chase within the business to say hey, we need all =
of this information, get us this information. They can start chasing it so =
that that way the task gets distributed across all the towers individually =
rather than trying to chase this across the whole board. I'm just out loud.

13:44
No, that's a good point. That's things we've already started. That's=
 we're. I don't know if you caught the first part of the conversation. =
We're looking at a high level tracker and that is what the functions are =
going to owe us already and that's something we're putting together for =
tomorrow. We're going to replicate the VRV tracker but essentially we've =
already gone to all the towers and we've gone to all the leaders to do that=
. Some of them have been very responsive and I have a couple emails as you =
sent me one from one of the groups that we have focal points. They gave us =
six names. We're going to go commercial, they gave us a bunch of names, =
we're going to go, there's a few other ones that we haven't seen. So that's=
 why we want the high level tracker to say hey finance, you haven't given =
us your local points yet, you haven't given us the PMs who are going to =
actually run these and make sure that the testing scenarios are done. And =
I'm just picking on finance. I go back and look to see if they're there, =
but that's the high level board. And then right after that we'll run =
through and make sure that they counterpart with the IT to make sure all =
the UAT is correlated.

14:42
Yep. The one key thing is going to be how do =
you want to track defects across all functions. Is it a SharePoint site? Is=
 it something else? Is it a Jira? I don't know.

14:53
I think it's all Jira. Right, Prakash? I think that's what they talked =
about.

14:56
Yeah. So we spoke about JIRA as a tool of choice.

14:59
Jira is. May not. Not all the users may have access to it. So there might =
be a limitation on the access to jira. I don't know. Again, please validate=
 that.

15:09
No, but that's part of the conversation to be had is how do =
we do that? What is a tool of choice and how do we get people trained on it=
? Right. So as part of the readiness for testing, we have to do that too. =
What we do want is a consistent way of testing all of this in that, you =
know, as in not just.

15:29
Consistency, but look at it from a cross =
functional true. You need to have a visibility because if you're going to =
go through jira, Fluency, Finance, Finance ISE or any other work streams, =
it's going to be a challenge. While I'm just thinking out loud here, not =
trying to shoot you down.

15:47
No, it's a valid question and that's the =
part of the conversation is we.

15:51
Need to decide on it on a tool might=
 be. Yeah, I should have pointed to say if you already have enough =
sharepoints out there, you just have to create one out there where each =
function can come in out there and create their entry. That way you do not =
have any restrictions, you do not provide too much of overhead training or =
anything to say this is how you create it. As in it's a simple form that =
you could have on a SharePoint and say log a ticket and each and every user=
, let's say for example, if I'm testing a purchase order and there is a =
finance deposit dependency in the erp, they could go ahead and log that =
defect on there instead of trying to figure out where do I lock this defect=
 which is transferring it over.

16:34
So it's a good point you're making. =
I think I'd like to hear more of your thoughts on it and if there's a point=
 of view of how Honeywell has done it in the past, that's simple enough. =
Again, we don't want to over engineer this and so I think you're bringing =
up good points. So if there's a point of view you have already as to what =
may work well for Honeywell and what people are used to, let's leverage =
that and so I think. I don't know, Pier, I would look to you then, Avinash,=
 is to provide that point of view as to how do we simplify life for =
everyone and have that end to end visibility. Right. We can always run.

17:12
Let's start with the high level first and then like the. Maybe we can=
 start with the SharePoint. Just make sure we get the tracker and the high =
level going. We can circle that tomorrow. I think I'm okay with looking at =
multiple options. The only reason I know that Jira was pushed was one, it =
was an IT implementation already, but it's also what the aura GDM was ran =
off of. So Emo and Ben and a couple of those guys already used to seeing it=
. Bimble's already used to seeing it, the core implementation. So I think =
that's one of the scenarios that they were going to use because JIRA was =
already that platform. Now I don't have objective one way or the other. I =
just want to make sure that we're able to visually see it and it's a common=
 frame. Grounded. What not from the functions, but also from leadership. So=
, Avantachi, I'm perfectly okay. Maybe we can spend some time this week =
looking at some different scenarios and figure out what fits best. I'll =
find some time on your calendar. We can look at it and Ricassa will just =
kind of put our heads together and say, hey, what works? Yeah, maybe we =
pitch both ideals to Hopkins and then say, hey, how do we want to present =
this? And then that way they make that decision of what's best for the =
program as a whole. Because we got thing too. It's not just on the IT side.=
 They're going to replicate this across all and possibly, you know, =
replicate this into winner.

18:31
True.

18:34
So it's all good points. I =
just think we need to start documenting it, putting it, you know, on paper,=
 and then getting the leadership to make some decisions. And they'll have =
to make them this week.

18:45
Yeah, agree. So, all right, so we have our =
action items here. So we'll send you the tracker for tomorrow, and then the=
 rest of it we'll have a view for us to share with you on Thursday =
afternoon, and then we can talk to Sukai on Friday.

19:03
Sounds good.

19:05
All right. Anything else from the room here?

19:08
Think we're good.

19:09
I think we're good. Okay. All right. Anything else from you, Avinash=
? But good points, good points. So I think, yeah, I think we'll. We'll =
certainly leverage your insights in Honeywell and IT to develop some of =
that stuff. All right. Thanks. All right.

19:28
Thank you. Take care.

19:33
I got off a call with Ben and Trinibas. Okay. And UAT came up. Sure.

conversation would be to lay out how we&#x27;ve done UAT in the past. Just =
our experience, our point of view on how does UAT execution typically work?=
 How do we want to plan for it? You know, how do the coordinators work with=
 each other, how is the mos and the structure set up, how does escalation =
work? You know, and then what, what sort of tools are typically used? In =
this case, we&#x27;re going with jira, you know, how will that process work=
? So at a high level and a first level double click, that&#x27;s our intent=
 in terms of the slideware to share with Sukai on Friday. Now, as part of =
that, I think one of the things is how do we want to track stuff? So =
there&#x27;s even the readiness tracking as well as later on execution =
tracking. But to the point you made earlier on, where are we with the =
readiness and planning for it? What are the gaps today? What meetings have =
we held? How do we close the gaps on identifying or narrowing down the =
scope? Identifying, narrowing down test scenarios, working to identify test=
 scripts. So I think there&#x27;s a tracker we&#x27;ll get by tomorrow =
morning to you that should have a view of at least the metrics we&#x27;re =
tracking to and then get a view of what&#x27;s there. I think that should =
help you and us drive each of the work streams to say what is in play, have=
 you developed the scenarios, have you connected with each other, do you =
know the systems in scope, where are the gaps, etc. So that&#x27;s what =
we&#x27;re thinking as a parallel track. One, to get you that tracker so =
that we can drive closure of that tracker. And two, get the, the content =
for the deck that I suspect will be a double triple click later on next =
week as well. But at least the first step, have the story there and the =
talk track around. Here&#x27;s how we typically would run UATs and or how =
UAT is run and all those things I mentioned earlier. So let me take a pause=
 there, see if that you&#x27;re aligned to that thinking.</div></div><div =

looking at it was obviously I need two different trackers, right. One that =
we&#x27;re going to need obviously is on a high level of Honeywell =
employees and functions in it. What is owed to us as the program. So like =
the focal points, right? Has everybody given us a focal point for it? Have =
they provided test scripts? So at a high level we need a tracker to make =
sure that. Go back to Jeff or sky say, hey, you know, finance owes us a =
scenario.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgrou=

we need a push, they can all see it. Then we, the next tracker is, you know=
, do we all have those in alignment on the granular level? What are the =
scenarios for? What does the process mapping look like? And now we can do =
that. And that kind of goes into what you talked about, what you guys =
already have, what you guys have done in the past. But I think that&#x27;s =
how my brain&#x27;s looking at it is Those are the two levels of the 90. =
The top level and then the granular.</div></div><div =

that is part of the workshop follow ups and everything else. So that. Yes, =
we&#x27;re, we&#x27;re brainstorming right now just to think of the metrics=
 to track as part of what you said, you know, test. Identifying roles is =
one, Identifying test scripts and scenarios is another. Closing the gaps on=
 process maps to systems is another. So there are five or six metrics we =
need to track to closing. So that will get you a view of state of play by =
tomorrow. So we can chase that down. The other part of this is the double =
click. How does, you know if something, and this comes as part of the =
execution, you know that the double click into it as okay, if something is =
not working. How do you, you know, how do you go about discovering it? How =
do you escalate things? I think that will be part of the mos that&#x27;s, =
that&#x27;s also being developed.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16=

 to go through it. But I would like to be able to show her a draft of what =
happens in this scenario and then who is in alignment, who we need to =
coordinate between because that&#x27;s probably the biggest gap I see =
within Honeywell. How we&#x27;re put together is from a function to another=
 function. We do not align well, you know, from function to it. We =
don&#x27;t align well. You know, there is a better correspondence between =
it and say finance, but if finance has to go to it, then it has to go to hr=
. There&#x27;s always a breakage there in how money will operate. So =
that&#x27;s where the coordination and those UAT coordinators and focal =
points are really vital to make this work.</div></div><div =

.6">Yes, totally with you. And I think what we&#x27;ll look to get is a =
view on how does that stitching and coordination work. We can beat up on it=
 and make it Honeywell centric, but at least a general guideline or a =
general process on what happens if things don&#x27;t work. How is the =
governance structure and the team structure that will be set up to run UAT =
and potentially command center? You know, how will that command center I =
don&#x27;t want to bring in yet because there&#x27;s a broader discussion =
on this whole POS and sos and how that will be cut over by the business, =
etc. But at least for UAT, work through what you&#x27;re specifically =
asking for there on what happens if something breaks, how does that cross =
functional coordination work? So that governance structure and that MOS and=
 that should help start addressing some of those questions. For Sukhai and =
Jeff, it will need. To your point, it will need a double click or a =
refinement with several cycles, but at least they can react to that as part=
 of the conversation Friday.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;pa=

note too, so that the highlights the tracker, how we&#x27;re going to do =
with the scenarios. But I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ve really thought this=
 as well too. How do we actually do this? Right. From a MOS perspective, we=
 know what they are, we know the scripts are going to go, but from a =
program level, we need to be able to track it. Right. We need to be able to=
 look at it. So do we hold like a weekly meeting on which ones we are? Do =
we host, you know, bi weekly? Is it monthly? Monthly&#x27;s too far out. =
Right. But I don&#x27;t want to just throw a meeting on the calendar for =
the sake of having a calendar. So we gotta figure out a legitimate MOS on =
how we operate and manage this from a program perspective. Right. How do we=
 track and make sure that we&#x27;re coordinating the functions, we&#x27;re=
 talking to each other, not just when this didn&#x27;t go well.=

Jeff, you know, this is PMO kind of thing. I think we should kind of pitch =
it directly saying, this is where involvement goes. This is where =
we&#x27;re going to need alignment and support from PMO to make sure that =
we do this right. So I just want to make sure we cover all the bases for =

we can drive closure. The other one is the mos and how we want to operate =
this and execute on it. That will come up as part of the roles, =
responsibilities across the teams and where we&#x27;ll need PMO and support=
 there. And then the third part is overall governance structure. Double =
click into how UAT is typically run. What is the. What is the governance? =
What are the processes in play? Now there were some trackers from a BRV =
readiness tracker that a PMO put out in the OPSEP call. So I&#x27;ll =
connect with Jennifer and leverage some of those in terms of reporting and =
dashboarding that may need to be there for, you know, how this governance =
and process would work. So, so yeah, so I&#x27;ll. We&#x27;ll connect with =

now because I remember that was a template that they already are used to =
seeing. So keeping similarities is always good. The last piece that I have =
and then we can open to see what else you guys have. Was the hyper care. =
Right. That&#x27;s not our first priority. We gotta get through uat, but I =

 cutover and hypercare model that the PMO will bring in. And I think that =
is part of a broader cutover team that they&#x27;re looking to stand up. =
Evan is looking to stand up and we need to align with them on. I get the =
cutover from an IT perspective and you know, the hypercare model from an IT=
 perspective. I think there&#x27;s a broader conversation on having a =
hypercare model that stood up for across the program and particularly =
around the POSO cutover on all of that happening. So we&#x27;ll need to =
line up with them or at least align with them first on that topic of =
hypercare as part of cutover and then bring that into the conversation with=

thought process out there is there are assigned project managers for each =
of the stream of towers within or there are multiple project managers =
depending on which tower you speak to. So if you, if you were to ask all =
these project managers to say hey, go get this information mapped out by X =
date, start with identify the number of test case scenarios, identify who =
the business focus are, who&#x27;s going to be testing again, they can in =
turn chase the loop within the tower itself and then by when are they =
expected to start whatever as in they could put up that information, the =
project manager should be able to gather that information or go figure out =
who to chase within the business to say hey, we need all of this =
information, get us this information. They can start chasing it so that =
that way the task gets distributed across all the towers individually =
rather than trying to chase this across the whole board. I&#x27;m just out =
loud.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;background-c=

the functions are going to owe us already and that&#x27;s something =
we&#x27;re putting together for tomorrow. We&#x27;re going to replicate the=
 VRV tracker but essentially we&#x27;ve already gone to all the towers and =
we&#x27;ve gone to all the leaders to do that. Some of them have been very =
responsive and I have a couple emails as you sent me one from one of the =
groups that we have focal points. They gave us six names. We&#x27;re going =
to go commercial, they gave us a bunch of names, we&#x27;re going to go, =
there&#x27;s a few other ones that we haven&#x27;t seen. So that&#x27;s why=
 we want the high level tracker to say hey finance, you haven&#x27;t given =
us your local points yet, you haven&#x27;t given us the PMs who are going =
to actually run these and make sure that the testing scenarios are done. =
And I&#x27;m just picking on finance. I go back and look to see if =
they&#x27;re there, but that&#x27;s the high level board. And then right =
after that we&#x27;ll run through and make sure that they counterpart with =
the IT to make sure all the UAT is correlated.</div></div><div =

 on a tool might be. Yeah, I should have pointed to say if you already have=
 enough sharepoints out there, you just have to create one out there where =
each function can come in out there and create their entry. That way you do=
 not have any restrictions, you do not provide too much of overhead =
training or anything to say this is how you create it. As in it&#x27;s a =
simple form that you could have on a SharePoint and say log a ticket and =
each and every user, let&#x27;s say for example, if I&#x27;m testing a =
purchase order and there is a finance deposit dependency in the erp, they =
could go ahead and log that defect on there instead of trying to figure out=
 where do I lock this defect which is transferring it over.</div></div><div=

 don&#x27;t want to over engineer this and so I think you&#x27;re bringing =

what may work well for Honeywell and what people are used to, let&#x27;s =
leverage that and so I think. I don&#x27;t know, Pier, I would look to you =

with the high level first and then like the. Maybe we can start with the =
SharePoint. Just make sure we get the tracker and the high level going. We =
can circle that tomorrow. I think I&#x27;m okay with looking at multiple =
options. The only reason I know that Jira was pushed was one, it was an IT =
implementation already, but it&#x27;s also what the aura GDM was ran off of=
. So Emo and Ben and a couple of those guys already used to seeing it. =
Bimble&#x27;s already used to seeing it, the core implementation. So I =
think that&#x27;s one of the scenarios that they were going to use because =
JIRA was already that platform. Now I don&#x27;t have objective one way or =
the other. I just want to make sure that we&#x27;re able to visually see it=
 and it&#x27;s a common frame. Grounded. What not from the functions, but =
also from leadership. So, Avantachi, I&#x27;m perfectly okay. Maybe we can =
spend some time this week looking at some different scenarios and figure =
out what fits best. I&#x27;ll find some time on your calendar. We can look =
at it and Ricassa will just kind of put our heads together and say, hey, =
what works? Yeah, maybe we pitch both ideals to Hopkins and then say, hey, =
how do we want to present this? And then that way they make that decision =
of what&#x27;s best for the program as a whole. Because we got thing too. =
It&#x27;s not just on the IT side. They&#x27;re going to replicate this =
across all and possibly, you know, replicate this into winner.=
