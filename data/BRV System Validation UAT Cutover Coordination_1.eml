Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 9th, 2025Attendees

   - Core program team
   - Data Intelligence leads
   - Finance representatives
   - HR and Supply Chain SMEs referenced
   - IT coordination (including Justin, Rajesh, Sriram, etc.)

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Review and Categorization of BRV/BRV-Adjacent
Systems

*Summary:*
Significant discussion focused on validating and aligning the list of
Build-Run-Validate (BRV) and BRV-adjacent systems across business
functions. The group compared sources from older and current decks,
Smartsheets, Excel trackers, and process owner notes to ensure accurate
system categorization. There were concerns about inconsistencies in the
"heat map" and system tagging, particularly for the Data Intelligence and
Finance categories.

*Key Points:*

   - Validation of 22 key systems from UAT planning and kickoff decks.
   - Identification of mismatches: e.g., Snowflake not appearing, CCEX apps
   mistakenly included, discrepancies due to improper heatmap tagging.
   - Agreement to confirm BRV/BRV-adjacent categorizations using Smartsheet
   trackers and through upcoming calls with subject matter experts (e.g.,
   Rajesh for data systems, finance leads for finance apps).
   - Recognition that some systems may have been incorrectly included due
   to auto-pulled data from project plans (e.g., CCEX, Live Without systems=
).

*Next Steps:*

   - Update the tracker to reflect only accurate BRV/BRV-adjacent systems.
   - Validate system mappings in collaboration with process and IT owners.

------------------------------
2. Finance, HR, and Other Functional Systems Mapping

*Summary:*
Detailed mapping and validation exercise for Finance, HR, ERP, and Supply
Chain systems marked as BRV or adjacent. Focus was on ensuring completeness
with respect to lists received from the various BU/process owners.

*Key Points:*

   - Identified seven core Finance systems, with versions and aliases
   (e.g., Hyperion, Blackline, SAP BI, Power BI, Workiva, FDS).
   - Some HR systems (PeopleSoft, ADP Celergo) discussed for their Day 1
   impact vs. longer-term replacement (e.g., Honeywell HCM).
   - Confirmed that some SAP instances, Concur, and other supporting
   systems should be classified as BRV or adjacent, based on business
   dependencies.
   - Clarified that some systems (e.g., specific portals) were
   misclassified or duplicated in initial lists.

*Next Steps:*

   - Engage respective business owners (e.g., Wednesday call with HR) to
   confirm and finalize system lists.
   - Clarify and update status of systems where ambiguity exists (BRV vs.
   Live Without).

------------------------------
3. Data Integrity and Status Tracking in System Inventory

*Summary:*
The meeting addressed the need for rigorous data management in the system
inventory, especially for test planning and ownership tracking.

*Key Points:*

   - Identification of erroneous BRV tagging, especially for legacy/default
   entries (e.g., Autodesk, eFax, automation tools).
   - Importance stressed on accurate reflection of system status, KT
   (knowledge transfer) status, and business function mapping.
   - Emphasis on updating and syncing the tracker and Smartsheets before
   stakeholder meetings.
   - Clarified dropdown values for KT status (Complete, Not Started, In
   Progress, N/A).
   - Dates for SIT and UAT phases should be driven by validated inputs, not
   by inherited heat map values.

*Next Steps:*

   - Reconcile tracker fields (system status, KT status, test timelines)
   with validated source data before calls.
   - Assign clear ownership for maintaining these updates.

------------------------------
4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Preparation and Entry/Exit Criteria

*Summary:*
Preparation of UAT entry/exit criteria and associated templates for use
across business functions. This included aligning on roles and
responsibilities, data requirements, test environments, and sign-off
procedures.

*Key Points:*

   - Entry criteria include having testers, completed SIT, ALM tool setup,
   test data/environment readiness, scenario identification, and approvals.
   - Exit criteria comprise all tests executed, defect management,
   documentation, completed sign-offs, and readiness to proceed to cutover.
   - Template prepared for presentation and validation with business SMEs.
   - Discussion around process for reviewing, customizing, and adopting
   criteria across different functions.
   - Plan to review criteria in upcoming alignment sessions and capture
   feedback.

*Next Steps:*

   - Place most up-to-date criteria and guidance documents in a new shared
   folder (=E2=80=9CBRV Alignment=E2=80=9D).
   - Wordsmith and finalize criteria templates before business stakeholder
   review.

------------------------------
5. Meeting Cadence and UAT/Go-Live Calendar Integration

*Summary:*
Discussed the need for a robust cadence for regular cross-functional
meetings relating to cutover, UAT preparation, and issue escalation.

*Key Points:*

   - Outlined weekly and daily meeting structure (referencing a Cutover
   Meeting Cadence slide):
      - Monday: Global Cutover, ISC update
      - Thursday: Weekly Legal Entity reviews, P2P meetings
      - Friday: Open item reviews
      - Ad-hoc sessions as needed (supply chain, HR, finance alignment)
   - Ensured necessary coordination with global process leads, regional
   teams, and business owners.
   - Discussed need for a clear escalation path and corresponding
   documentation (e.g., "MOs" or Modes of Operations slides).
   - Plan to align UAT activities and timelines with this cadence.

*Next Steps:*

   - Finalize and communicate the draft cadence, ensuring all relevant
   stakeholders are included.
   - Send explicit communication, removing UAT as a generic agenda item and
   distributing it as a focused message.

------------------------------
6. Ownership Mapping and Service Owner Validation

*Summary:*
Focused discussion on confirming ownership for every BRV, BRV-adjacent, and
TSA system. This is critical for accountability across build-back,
move-as-is, and cutover phases.

*Key Points:*

   - Goal: Complete mapping of service owners for all pertinent systems
   (excluding Live Without).
   - Cross-reference ownership data with current tracker; update as
   necessary.
   - Clarify roles and responsibilities between Athens service owners,
   business focal points, and UAT leads.
   - Need to collect missing UAT lead info from business representatives
   (e.g., Sriram for finance).
   - Maintain tracker with validated ownership and responsibility data.

*Next Steps:*

   - Assign service owner validation as a near-term action, targeting
   responses by June 12th (original agenda planned June 13th).
   - Communicate the request directly and remove from broader agenda to
   ensure focus.

UnknownSpeaker10:00
Making sense.
UnknownSpeaker20:02
So do you know if there's a list of vrvr? Do you just want to go through
right now real quick and tag them with me?
UnknownSpeaker10:10
We. We have them as a list in our kickoff decks. In one of our UAT planning
decks, we have that list of the 20 yard. Either this or in one of the older
decks we have a list of.
UnknownSpeaker20:42
Is it this one?
UnknownSpeaker10:44
Nope. Yeah, those. Yeah, these. These are likely the ones.
UnknownSpeaker20:58
Reddit Red would run my jobs.
UnknownSpeaker11:02
Some of these just don't make sense, but they're probably. They're
probably. Yeah. For example, initial analysis. I wouldn't even do this. I
mean I. Can you look further down. These are processes for functional
testing. But yeah, look at 22, 23. What are those?
UnknownSpeaker21:43
Those are coordinators.
UnknownSpeaker11:45
Okay, further on down, it might be in an older. Older deck. Yeah, it's not
here. Let's at look at another deck we have.
UnknownSpeaker22:10
That was BRV Planning Discussion V1.
UnknownSpeaker12:16
Click that one.
UnknownSpeaker22:18
This is a pretty good one.
UnknownSpeaker12:27
Okay, somewhere in here should be a list. Go to 13. Okay, so these are
your. Yeah, some of these may not make sense. Like ccex, there's nothing
there. But the other ones we should be able to.
UnknownSpeaker22:53
Yeah, these I could probably map to apps.
UnknownSpeaker12:57
Okay, so one view is there in Data Intelligence. Okay. All right. At the
minimum we should make sure these 22. So go back to your 22. I'm just
looking at and let's. We'll compare against this note. So go back to Excel
filter by Data and Intelligence Business function.
UnknownSpeaker23:36
Oh.
UnknownSpeaker13:42
So you got for one view Advisor GPT Advisor GPT is not here, but one view
is there. Pricing funnel Power doesn't make sense. Snowflake is not there,
which is the edw. Yeah, these. Please don't. There should be no CCEX apps
here because you don't see we just. Stephen Brown for example, made a note
that there's no CCX impact to brv so we shouldn't really have.
UnknownSpeaker24:35
Yeah, I mean there's one that's adjacent that's like SFDC sdfc sfdc
salesforce.com. yeah, was mentioned in ISC as adjacent, but it's not in.
UnknownSpeaker14:50
Yeah, if that's called adjacent on the right, then that's.
UnknownSpeaker24:52
It's not. That's a different one.
UnknownSpeaker14:55
Should be a BRV then we should make sure it's that one.
UnknownSpeaker24:59
Well, these are just from the heat map. So these are the heat.
UnknownSpeaker15:03
Heat map is probably wrong. Yeah, probably not tagged the heat map
correctly. So that's an ask that maybe that's another ask is the Laundry
list of asks for tomorrow. Let's. Let's note this down in a bullet point.
So ask number one.
UnknownSpeaker25:21
So I did kind of include that. I was like, confirm brv, non br. V, BRV
adjacent categorization.
UnknownSpeaker15:27
Yes. In the smartsheets, right?
UnknownSpeaker25:30
Yes.
UnknownSpeaker15:30
Is it in the. In the. In the tracker?
UnknownSpeaker25:32
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker15:33
Okay, now we need to explain to them what brv, br, non, brv. And this thing
is. So maybe we do need a conversation with Rajesh. So. But let's go back
to the data. Let's go back to the Excel, and you can see that the four data
and intelligence ones are not the same ones like RPA. Advise a GPT1 view.
Yes. But we really should have things around Snowflake, EDW and then
whatever else is in the other PowerPoint that you just saw.
UnknownSpeaker26:14
So can I send that to Justin and ask him to fix the heat map?
UnknownSpeaker16:24
Yeah, we should have a call with Justin to. Maybe we do that tomorrow. In
the call with it or as part of this it all it connect, we tell them to fix
the heat map.
UnknownSpeaker26:38
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker16:39
Because you see here six 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So these six are the ones that
are. They are BRV, BRV adjacent, if you will.
UnknownSpeaker26:51
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker16:52
Power, BI, Snow, Snowflake, Informatica, Oneview, Alteryx, and Fivetran are
all going live in sometime in June or July, so. Or likely sometime. You
know, this is probably an older but. Yeah. So these. These Rajesh or his
gang should be able to tell us for the 6 in data, these should be the BRVs.
Similarly, if you look at 5 finance, you've got the finance stuff that
Finance sends. So that will probably overwrite this. Finance has seven
systems. We should call those out. I think that's already there. Right. So
if you look at our Excel, you should have Finance. It's not just two. We
need to understand where. If you recall the notes that they send.
UnknownSpeaker27:46
Yeah, I haven't pulled in the Finance one yet. It's gonna be. Let me see. I
only pulled in isc. It took a while to map, because in isc, some of those
in their template, that ISC template, a lot of them were like multiple
systems. Right. Like.
UnknownSpeaker18:08
You'Ll also see that some of them are duplicate or some of them in our
inventory are called duplicate or, you know, they're not in business scope.
So.
UnknownSpeaker28:16
So these are the seven that were listed from Finance, Blackline, SAP, bi,
edw, fos, Power, bi, Workiva, ffds.
UnknownSpeaker18:35
Which is Hyperion, essbase. So you'll have a couple of Hyperions. So fds.
So it's fds. And if you look at our list, we should see do Hyperion. You
might have other flags in here. Okay, so both of these are in brv. Yeah,
they should be. Then the other one has, well, a black line. And these, you
should say, you know, it's in the heat map or it's tagged or whatever it
is. It's nullist. And then we should also have S space ESS base. And then
they've got PI. It may be called Power bi. Yeah. So yeah, select both data
and intelligence. So we should call that BR Data Intelligence. Yeah. Oh,
no, this one was a power bi. Yeah, so they needed.
UnknownSpeaker210:43
I would call this BRV adjacent because there's a bunch of Power BI
dashboards that are used by Finance, by isc, by hr, maybe.
UnknownSpeaker111:01
Sure. But the other part of this is it's a build back and it's happening at
that same time. So it could be also brv, but leave it for BRV adjacent for
now and we can change it to BRV if needed.
UnknownSpeaker211:22
Then this one, SAP nwbi. This was. I think this might be BRV adjacent from
the ISC list.
UnknownSpeaker111:36
Okay. They had different bi, but I don't know.
UnknownSpeaker211:41
I'll leave it as is.
UnknownSpeaker111:47
It's netweaver Business Intelligence. So probably it's a business
warehouse. You got it as. Okay. We haven't had it listed, but yeah, leave
it off for now.
UnknownSpeaker212:01
Hcm.
UnknownSpeaker112:03
So HCM is probably. You won't find. So you will probably have it as
Honeywell. You probably need it as PeopleSoft. We don't have that entry
here.
UnknownSpeaker212:21
We have PeopleSoft HR.
UnknownSpeaker112:24
So we should put that as a BRB. Because it's an HR thing.
UnknownSpeaker212:32
But it's Live without.
UnknownSpeaker112:35
Yeah, technically speaking it's a. It's a day one live without. But the
point is it's. This is August 1st, where it's still used. And then the new
one, which is Honeywell HCM is not there, but we should maybe leave it here
for now and then we should have adp, see if you have adp. ADP Expert
Services is not necessarily what it is. There's a new adp. Let me just
check. ADP Expert Services and ADP Solargo. ADP Expert Services. Okay, so
the platform is Celergo, but they don't have it. Okay, so it's not this. So
this. You won't have Celergo, but it's brand new, it's outsourced brand
new. So, okay, let's move off of hr. But we know we have two systems in hr.
We'll talk to them about it. We'll talk to them about it Wednesday when we
connect with them.
UnknownSpeaker214:10
What about all of these SAP ones?
UnknownSpeaker114:13
No.
UnknownSpeaker214:15
They'Re all. No, no.
UnknownSpeaker114:18
Except the ones we have listed.
UnknownSpeaker214:23
Get just a couple.
UnknownSpeaker114:26
So there will be a few. So SAP. You should have ECC here. Do you have SAP?
ECC prod. Okay. Line 234. 236 above. Yeah. Below. One below. Yeah. SAP.
Erp. Has to be. It's the main BRV that. I don't know. Yeah, probably that's=
.
UnknownSpeaker215:00
This was from I. Isc.
UnknownSpeaker115:02
Isc. Got it. Okay. Okay.
UnknownSpeaker215:09
And then these two were from ISC as well.
UnknownSpeaker115:12
Okay. All right.
UnknownSpeaker215:23
Anything else from finance we're missing?
UnknownSpeaker115:26
Yeah, we should have. Let's go back and look. Black line, SAP, bi, edw, ed,
fds, Power bi. So we have BI and Power bi. So maybe we should add both the
BI there. Right. The nw, netweaver, bi. So put that as a brb. Actually, we
should put it as. Yeah, they need. So BRV adjacent. Yeah, yeah. The first
one may end up being brv, but. Okay. Okay. And then workiva. Brv. What was
the other ones there?
UnknownSpeaker216:26
Concur.
UnknownSpeaker116:27
Concur. Yeah. Brv. It's a tsa, so brv. Yeah, it's adjacent. Likely they're
using it for testing. It's on a tsa. So adjacent. Okay, so if you filter by
finance, let's look at finance functions that are brv. You had FIN as well.
Okay. Okay. How many br. How many BRV do we have? Airspace. We're kiva.
Black line, Hyperion Finance Power apps. Okay. Hierarchy management, Flat
form. Yeah, leave that in there. That's Ehm. Concur. Okay. Anything else
below?
UnknownSpeaker217:43
Now that's.
UnknownSpeaker117:45
Okay. So that seems like a good list. And then we just need to understand.
Oh, credit card application, tsa. Okay. Okay.
UnknownSpeaker218:00
There's a bunch of these, like, portals.
UnknownSpeaker118:03
Where do you see finance portals?
UnknownSpeaker218:05
Not finance.
UnknownSpeaker118:09
Just Chase Search portal. That's a commercial. One is Cyber. These are all
customer care. They're not the same portals that ISC talked about. Toller
portal. Yes, the others are not. They're not the same portals that we
talked about with ise.
UnknownSpeaker218:29
Yeah, I just wanted to confirm.
UnknownSpeaker118:34
All right, so anything else in finance? So I think we have solved that.
UnknownSpeaker218:38
We're good for finance, we're good for isc, we're good for hr. We have
those two.
UnknownSpeaker118:44
Yeah. And then hse. There's also ERP that they have. So. So we should have.
Yeah, none of these. They actually need The ERP for that, which is fine. So
okay, so we know the big ones are hr. We know finance and ERP and supply
chain. So let's go back and filter how many BRV Systems we've got.
UnknownSpeaker219:27
PRV, we have 30.
UnknownSpeaker119:29
Okay. Okay. Efax, who wrote. So this is the other piece Is these maybe not
right?
UnknownSpeaker219:40
Yeah, those were the default ones.
UnknownSpeaker119:42
Yeah, they're not right. Like a lot of them are Live Without. Yeah, they're
not.
UnknownSpeaker219:56
Do the PeopleSoft live without?
UnknownSpeaker119:59
Yeah, PeopleSoft is okay. PeopleSoft is fine. But some of this other stuff
like.
UnknownSpeaker220:03
Autodesk, those were in the original list.
UnknownSpeaker120:07
They have been wrongly marked. Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker220:13
Yeah, like Autodesk.
UnknownSpeaker120:14
So we should have. We should also do Compass and procure. Ivalua is I value
there. I value compass. Okay. Line 55 down here. Row 36 here. Okay. Okay.
Procurement. Okay. Yeah. Because it'll be tested in this appian. All right.
Yeah. Some of this BRV is wrong. So like stat for PeopleSoft. No. So what I
want to make sure is these go back into the work plans and get updated.
UnknownSpeaker220:58
Yes, I can send it back to Justin to go manage that.
UnknownSpeaker121:04
Through like Resilink. I don't think as a risk management tool. I don't
think anything is being done there. Sale point. Okay, maybe you know what?
You know what? Maybe some of these things are like identity and access
management that need to happen. So leave that, leave that there. Stat for
PeopleSoft. Okay, you know what? Leave that there.
UnknownSpeaker221:36
What about these BRV Live withouts peoplesoft we talked about. What about
this Ontic NA Prod Corp.
UnknownSpeaker121:46
If it's a cyber security it is probably.
UnknownSpeaker221:49
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker121:50
So again, keep in mind Live without is a D1 November 1st solution.
UnknownSpeaker221:54
You're right.
UnknownSpeaker121:55
It doesn't mean that it is not used for testing in August one.
UnknownSpeaker221:59
Yeah, you're right.
UnknownSpeaker122:01
So Efax Dex, I don't know automation anywhere. I don't think we have it
there. Right. I don't think we had it in automation and data intelligence,
Advisor GPT, Prod Corp. I don't think we had it there. Pricing funnel,
power platform maybe. But some of this other stuff Advisor GPT and RPA is
probably not.
UnknownSpeaker222:34
You don't think RPA might be like there might be some process automation
somewhere that they need to rebuild and test.
UnknownSpeaker122:45
The process is not changing. Understood, but let's ask them that question.
UnknownSpeaker222:52
Yeah, I'll go.
UnknownSpeaker122:54
So tomorrow we should say these are the BRV and BRV adjacent. So on our
call with supply chain we should ask have this sheet and validate this with
the data team, with the. Whoever else is in there. But like Dex, maybe they
have a identity and security there as well. So I'm just concerned. Hgs. I
agree. Ise. Yes. Hr maybe. So those are the only things we need to. So how
many do we have? 30.
UnknownSpeaker223:28
We have 30 BRVs.
UnknownSpeaker123:31
So CCEX. No way. I don't know why. It's salesforce.com channel management.
Maybe that's a PRV adjacent.
UnknownSpeaker223:42
I would put that at BRB adjacent because Salesforce came up.
UnknownSpeaker123:46
But we have to see if that's the same Salesforce. Like if you. If you do
SFTC or Salesforce. Filter. Just filter for system name SFTC.
UnknownSpeaker224:02
So if the one that I marked wasn't SFTC.
UnknownSpeaker124:06
Yeah. So you've got 11.2 prompt. So that's a TSA. You can see that many of
these are like Live without.
UnknownSpeaker224:14
And they're called this one the BRV adjacent.
UnknownSpeaker124:20
Okay.
UnknownSpeaker224:21
Because.
UnknownSpeaker124:21
Yep.
UnknownSpeaker224:21
Sales. SFTC was in the.
UnknownSpeaker124:24
I think it was supply chain.
UnknownSpeaker224:27
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I call this BRV.
UnknownSpeaker124:30
Yeah. And then you've got digital services vendor finance, salesforce.com
pmt channel management.
UnknownSpeaker224:44
I don't think that I would know this out.
UnknownSpeaker124:47
I don't know. The first one is a brv. Leave that as a non. Yeah. Okay.
Okay. See if there's any SFDC mentioned.
UnknownSpeaker225:07
I don't think so because I was looking for that.
UnknownSpeaker125:18
Okay. That's your Salesforce. So that one is a brv. Ah. It's a live
without. So maybe it's a. Okay, interesting. So this is the thing. Like
some of these live withouts, they're not going to go through sit testing,
UAT testing and all that jazz because there's nothing to do in testing if
you're living without it. So we can't just blindly put test dates against
them.
UnknownSpeaker225:55
Yeah. And I think that that's the question for Justin is in his heat map.
Where did these test dates come from?
UnknownSpeaker126:01
From the plants. Because again, I told you, they mapped them to the PRJs,
the project IDs. So when you map it's not a one to one, it's just mapping
that these are CCEX systems. And when you look at a CCEX project plan, if
there are test dates, then it applies them equally to all the apps under
that.
UnknownSpeaker226:20
That's crazy that they didn't get down.
UnknownSpeaker126:22
To the app level. Well, because it's not a. It's not an. It's just an auto
pull and a lookup.
UnknownSpeaker226:28
Yeah. But I mean whoever put in, created the work plans, didn't get down to
the app level.
UnknownSpeaker126:34
You don't need to. In some cases they did, in some cases they didn't.
UnknownSpeaker226:38
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker126:40
Okay, so again, for the purposes of tomorrow, I'm still not comfortable
with this list then because it's not right. So. Okay, so this is a system
tracker that we're telling them that needs to go. So this is step number
one.
UnknownSpeaker226:53
Step number one, what is. I mean it's, it's right to the degree I think
that we know about. And that's one of the actions is this F. And.
UnknownSpeaker127:08
We.
UnknownSpeaker227:09
I pre populated it with Honeywell service owner. It's review these two,
fill in the Athens service owner for the build back.
UnknownSpeaker127:19
And move as is.
UnknownSpeaker227:21
And move as is.
UnknownSpeaker127:23
Yeah. Then you've got KT status and that's a drop down of, you know,
complete. Done. Whatever it is in progress we should do you have
candidates? Just go to one of the dropdowns like KT status, click on a
cell. Is that a drop down?
UnknownSpeaker227:42
I lost them because I uploaded it to Smartsheet and brought it back down.
UnknownSpeaker127:47
Okay.
UnknownSpeaker227:48
In one of these I do. But it's KT status is just those.
UnknownSpeaker127:54
Three System type complete. Not started. Na.
UnknownSpeaker228:01
In progress.
UnknownSpeaker128:03
In progress. Yeah, yeah. Not started. In progress. Complete. And then.
Yeah, so you have to make sure those four are there and then sit Start,
date and end date is what they will have to provide to us if there is. Now
if we have some dates we can populate them based on like for example,
these, these dates, where do they come from?
UnknownSpeaker228:28
These came from the heat map.
UnknownSpeaker128:30
I would not trust the heat map.
UnknownSpeaker228:33
Like I could pull in the ones from the ISC slide.
UnknownSpeaker128:36
Yes, and, and yeah, and finance.
UnknownSpeaker228:39
I mean actually I don't know if that finance had dates on it. Did it?
UnknownSpeaker128:45
No. So finance didn't. But we can ask them in the. Call the finance guys.
But the Finance Finance are the same apps that you have dates for. So in
the. So go to, go to BRV Finance apps. So click on business function
finance and then BRV2 adjacents. Okay. Yeah, you can remove the hyphen but
yeah, that's fine. So if you click on Finance. Okay, so let's go to the
right. So these are black lines. So for each of these we should have actual
dates in the PowerPoint. So and this, these are actually coming from the
work plans. But this is what we need to. So let's go. If you go to the
PowerPoint where we have the list of the 22 apps. Yeah. So you've got sit
dates, you've got UAT dates here.
UnknownSpeaker230:02
Let me find black line. Black line is 62 to 6 9. And then so black line was
62 to 6 9. For sit. Black line is yet gotten pushed back 617 to 624. And
then UAT in the PowerPoint was 610 to 6 17.
UnknownSpeaker130:45
Okay so maybe then this is part of the activities for them to confirm these=
.
UnknownSpeaker230:50
Yes.
UnknownSpeaker130:51
So that's exactly where now for these finance we need to now certainly for
the ise, you can take the list from his. From Google.
UnknownSpeaker231:02
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker131:05
So the ask would be maybe if you validated something, put it in a green
color. But in the others like, you know, like ise, you've got that from
them. So you could put it in green and say okay, this is validated. And
then for the ones others that are black, you could.
UnknownSpeaker231:28
Validate the whole row. Like when. When you have validated this whole row
left to right.
UnknownSpeaker131:33
Yes. Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker231:34
Market X. And we'll go green.
UnknownSpeaker131:38
Okay, that's fine. But yeah, so. So they ask in the finance call would be
these are the dates we have. Tell me if this is right or wrong. And Harry
can tell us and his team can tell tell us. And so where there'll be actions
coming out from either him or us to say, okay, we go and update the work
plans. We update this because this will then update Smartsheet and Capital
Edge. The challenge is there is already an update of Capital Edge through
the work plans. That heat map sheet.
UnknownSpeaker232:12
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker132:13
So we need to either break that connection or do something else because
otherwise it'll be overwritten.
UnknownSpeaker232:18
Got it. And then also the validate for finance. These are the BRV apps that
we have down for finance. Here's why.
UnknownSpeaker132:28
And that's by business. That's by business as well. So yeah, by finance and
Harry by. By the. By the finance guys as well as by Harry.
UnknownSpeaker232:37
Yes. And is this the full list of. Of BRV for finance or is there anything
missing or any of these that are mostly.
UnknownSpeaker132:49
They are. I think that's the question that I.
UnknownSpeaker232:52
Want to ask on that call as well. It's like yeah, validate, validate the
dates. Who's the at the Athens service owner and or is this the right set
of BRV apps and what ask like pull then the other functions and say who has
a dependency on these for testing?
UnknownSpeaker133:16
All of these are finance.
UnknownSpeaker233:18
They are all finance. But who what other functions need the system? That
was the column in isc.
UnknownSpeaker133:26
Right, right, right, right. So we can do the same for here if supply chain
may need it or ERP may Need it, need it. Yeah, we can do that. But yes, I
think finance is specific enough that maybe just. So the other piece of
this is finance is going to need a whole bunch of systems. This particular
systems are very financial reporting perspective. So they're reporting
centric and consolidation, which is typically just finance related. So
unlike supply chain, this might end up being just a finance ask, but it's a
question we should ask. So tomorrow we should have this for supply chain.
We should also do this for other, you know, the Tuesday, the Wednesday and
the Thursday calls. Yeah, okay. So that's step number one. We should do a
live thing. There are so many other things we need as a template. So we've
got roles, responsibilities that, that sheet, we've got this sheet, we've
got entry exit criteria that we need to look at. So we need to develop an
entry exit criteria for them or we let them develop it and you know, we
write something and we take it to them and say, here's an entry exit
criteria. Go do this on your own or come back to us with an update. So
that's the third piece I know in the Oak as well as the other new things.
We got some entry exit criteria.
UnknownSpeaker235:00
So this is what I pulled. Oh, shoot. I don't know. But.
UnknownSpeaker135:25
Windings.
UnknownSpeaker235:27
I don't know what happened to the stuff.
UnknownSpeaker135:35
This is. No, well, some of this kind of. But entry exit criteria for
testing or it would be aligned between business and it and they'll be on
the whole the same. So if you take a look at the example from Oak or from
some of the others, it's the case. A lot of this is the same. You're right
in that a lot of this is inclusive of it. But let's. There's a separate set
of. So legal entity changes or you know, test is identified, you know,
test, test criteria defined, etc. Etc. So there's a. There's a couple and
we can repurpose what we have and tweak it a little bit. So here you should
have down the lane. Yeah, test is identified, sit complete, tools and
signatures, you know, test scenarios done. So yeah, so these would be sort
of UAT testing, entry exit criteria, if it's not already there.
UnknownSpeaker236:49
Okay.
UnknownSpeaker136:50
So we should leverage this in our conversation tomorrow and say this is the
entry exit criteria. We've got this. How do I this the template or put it
on a slide, then we can wordsmith it ahead of that call. One thing I'm
going to ask you is can you put all of these in a folder there called BRV
alignment under the same brv. Then we can put all these things, these Excel
sheets in there and we can. We can go one by one with them.
UnknownSpeaker237:32
Through them. Yeah, exactly.
UnknownSpeaker137:35
Okay, what else do we know? What else should we do? We need. Okay, let's go
Back to our PowerPoint the. The three boxes that we're going to send today.
So system level ownership Erv. So complete ownership mapping of all 296.
Okay. I would. I'm hesitant to say all 296 because if it's a live without,
they don't care. So we should say for all build back move as is and TSA
applications.
UnknownSpeaker238:23
Oh I see. Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker138:38
And TSA apps. Okay. Validate the service owners and KT for all. So what's
the ownership mapping and what's the validate the service owners? What's
the difference?
UnknownSpeaker239:02
I mean this is just the overall like what are we asking them to do here?
It's the same thing.
UnknownSpeaker139:07
Okay, okay, okay, got it, got it. So validate service owners for all apps
and scope. I shouldn't say for all apps in scope. I'd say maybe just say
for all pertinent apps. I get your meaning of apps in scope, but it could
be misconstrued to mean live without is also an app and scope today. But
semantics. But I just want them to be clear and then confirm BRV adjacent
categorization. Okay. Do they need to do test dates or where is that
happening? That's in the next one. Is it testing timelines. Okay. Lock in
testing dates at app level. Update Excel tracker. Okay, so the lock in is
the first. Yeah, similar. Okay. Update Excel tracker with sit UAT dates.
Update work plans to reflect latest test and go live dates. Okay. The
challenge here would be that it's not a one to one on the work plan. So
they may or may not ending show up but we'll have to see. And then on the
right process level working sessions. What is the pre populated process
template?
UnknownSpeaker240:22
I mean it's really become the same thing. It's actually this. It's this
sheet.
UnknownSpeaker140:30
That'S all systems.
UnknownSpeaker240:34
Or. Sorry. No it's not. You're right. It's the. It's like the ISC one.
UnknownSpeaker140:42
Okay. So the ISC one. So we don't need to. They don't need to validate
anything then or let's go back.
UnknownSpeaker240:52
So like for ISC that they came up with like in that ISC template. Right.
The. The key systems.
UnknownSpeaker141:05
Right.
UnknownSpeaker241:05
Who provided that?
UnknownSpeaker141:06
That's what they're doing here. Kai is that's functions. Functions to the
key systems. Yeah, but again yeah, but that's there. Do we have one for
finance? Do we have one for.
UnknownSpeaker241:19
Yeah, that's on my. That's on my list for tonight, but exactly.
UnknownSpeaker141:23
And then we need one for hr which may be two, three apps.
UnknownSpeaker241:27
Yeah, it's going to be those two that we talked about. This is like the ISC
key systems. Was this one key system function needing the system IT
workstream PM disposition, testing required, UAT lead.
UnknownSpeaker141:48
Now HR may not be nothing. So it's really finance. We just need one for
finance.
UnknownSpeaker241:52
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker141:54
Okay, so if you do finance key systems, the same seven systems and then
finance has given us those seven or eight and now we need the same IT work
stream, it pm IT disposition.
UnknownSpeaker242:09
Yeah, we've got the PM from the resource tracker. The UAT lead from the
resource tracker. Testing required. Let them fill that out.
UnknownSpeaker142:20
The UAT lead. Who filled that? That's finance guy filling it out. Yeah, I
think the finance supply chain guy filling it out. Sriram.
UnknownSpeaker242:29
The finance people filled it out in our, you know, the resource tracker.
UnknownSpeaker142:34
Yeah, but those are, they're not business UAT leads. They're points of
contact for. So if you fill this out here, unless Shri Ram is filling that
out. Don't fill it out. Business UAT lead is not you and I to fill it out.
It's Sriram to fill it out.
UnknownSpeaker242:51
They were in the like in. I think it's in this one. You know that one
online that was circulated to last week in this all IT call. It's the one
on the Honeywell side.
UnknownSpeaker143:21
It's what you just showed.
UnknownSpeaker243:23
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker143:30
Again, go back to. Just go back to the folder where it would be. But what.
UnknownSpeaker243:36
Yeah, it's on the Honeywell side.
UnknownSpeaker143:38
Okay.
UnknownSpeaker243:46
Soon Athens essentially like in. In. In this one. Right. Like didn't find
it. Did finance fill out. I guess we don't have any finance finance input
here.
UnknownSpeaker144:23
So business would have come in here and filled out the business focal. But
they're not necessarily the UAT test lead. Okay, so don't fill it out.
That's a business activity. Sriram to fill it out in that other sheet.
UnknownSpeaker244:39
So we'll leave UAT test lead blank for finance and let Sriram to populate
this one.
UnknownSpeaker144:47
Ise.
UnknownSpeaker244:49
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't populate. I didn't fill this out.
UnknownSpeaker144:52
You didn't fill that column out?
UnknownSpeaker244:54
No.
UnknownSpeaker144:55
Okay then sure. I'm presuming Sriram did.
UnknownSpeaker244:57
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker144:58
Okay. Okay.
UnknownSpeaker245:04
So we have to create one of these for finance.
UnknownSpeaker145:08
Yes.
UnknownSpeaker245:09
And then on our thing here.
UnknownSpeaker145:16
So review process levels, I would say. Yeah. So a couple of things. Align
on roles, responsibilities align on entry exit criteria.
UnknownSpeaker245:40
Is this pre work. Is this like an ask for them to do as far as like
homework goes? This is. That's the agenda.
UnknownSpeaker145:46
That's an attending. That's. That's attend. Attend. Attend sessions to
align on. Yeah, you know, first one's roles and responsibilities that
you've got the line on already. So yeah, just do roles, attend sessions,
align on entry exit criteria? Do we need to light on UAT tools and
logistics? I think we said the other one. Right. UAT calendar, testing,
testing period and then tools and logistics. Okay, so if they have to view
calendar, you're going to view the calendar, which is the next slide. If
they have to do ownership tracker, maybe put. Put not Harvey balls, but put
some balls here to identify that. This is 1, 2 and 3. And you know, do some
breadcrumbs on the other slide to say that's 1, 2 and 3. So ownership and
PRV involvement is in the next slide. So this is number one.
UnknownSpeaker248:01
Exactly. This is like.
UnknownSpeaker148:08
Yeah. And then what's number two?
UnknownSpeaker248:14
Two is. It's kind of this. It's one and two, really.
UnknownSpeaker148:20
Okay.
UnknownSpeaker248:20
Do we want to combine these?
UnknownSpeaker148:23
No, you could call them 1 and 2 in the Harvey ball. Not Harvey ball. The.
The balls.
UnknownSpeaker248:27
I would say like 1A. Like this is like 1A is this with plus the BRV thing.
So I can make a way to like make it very clear. Like this is like one and
then like one is the soft. Two is the hard like the dates. Really. Okay,
two, it's like one is the ownership. And is it like the categorization BRV
or non BRV or adjacent? Two is what are the dates? Pretty much.
UnknownSpeaker149:03
And I would. And 13th you're giving them is a Friday. So I would want them
to do it earlier than that. Do it as you know, if we're sending this to
them tonight, to Sakina so she can add it in the list, then. Yeah, either
that or we send them separately. We've got two things, two options. One,
not include it in Sakina, tell her to remove the uad, but send this off. Or
two, send this separately for uat because it might likely. If this is
urgent, then it's likely going to get lost in the notes for the rest of the
work.
UnknownSpeaker249:49
If this is urgent, it's going to. So it's going to get lost if we send it
with the rest or if we send it separately.
UnknownSpeaker149:56
No, if we send it if we send it with the rest of the other five things in
there.
UnknownSpeaker250:02
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker150:03
Then it will get lost.
UnknownSpeaker250:05
Then let's send it separately.
UnknownSpeaker150:07
Okay. Then we have to remove. We have to remove it from the. From the
agenda. So we need to tell Sakina to remove it from the agenda.
UnknownSpeaker250:21
Let me ping her right now. It. Okay, perfect.
UnknownSpeaker151:12
So.
UnknownSpeaker251:12
So then the date I would give them is the 13th. The 12th.
UnknownSpeaker151:20
12Th. So we should send this to them tomorrow with a cover slide and a
commentary that says we need you to do A, B and C and. Or we should send it
separately. The typical black slide there for commentary earlier. We should
send this tonight because if they're going to participate in these
workshops, these alignment sessions, then they need to see it.
UnknownSpeaker252:00
Yeah, I mean, we're on track to send it tonight for sure.
UnknownSpeaker152:03
Okay. Okay. So get me where you can tonight. I will send it tonight
separately.
UnknownSpeaker252:09
Okay.
UnknownSpeaker152:13
Oh, and one more thing. The MOs, we also need to show them the MOs of how
we're doing the UAT coordination. So do you have a view of the MOs?
UnknownSpeaker252:24
No, I need to make it.
UnknownSpeaker152:26
Okay, from that one.
UnknownSpeaker252:28
We talked about it like the.
UnknownSpeaker152:31
Yeah. And there's another example here from the cutover governance that
these guys had. Wonder if you have here.
UnknownSpeaker252:43
Like, that's the easy one to me. Like, the hard part was getting all of
this data aligned.
UnknownSpeaker152:48
Yeah. Here, this is from Robs. Let me know if you have access it. Okay.
UnknownSpeaker253:53
Yeah, I got it. Oh, I like the other one better.
UnknownSpeaker153:58
Page two is an mos, so.
UnknownSpeaker254:00
Okay, but I do see what you're saying about, like, the. When, like you said
you could do the combined, like this one plus a.
UnknownSpeaker154:07
Version of this one, which is what page two is. Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker254:11
Okay.
UnknownSpeaker154:11
The other in the other deck.
UnknownSpeaker254:13
Yes, yes, this one.
UnknownSpeaker154:18
So if you. There's an added thing here of escalations. So you could involve
the same thing, because the same. You could say, cut over cadence or, you
know, UAT cadence and have the meetings here. So the Tuesday or the once a
week, for example, could be the black or the, you know, maybe that's on a
Tuesday where the UAT coordinators meet. And then Wednesday they present at
the OPSEP as an input in there, and then maybe Thursday they meet again. So=
.
UnknownSpeaker254:58
Okay. Okay. Give me just a couple minutes to bang out the.
UnknownSpeaker155:10
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
UnknownSpeaker255:11
Overall structure for the other one, and then I'll ping you in a little bit=
.
UnknownSpeaker155:15
Yeah, whenever you. Yeah, just ping me the final document.
UnknownSpeaker255:18
Yeah.
UnknownSpeaker155:19
And then. Yeah, so we've got the tracker. We've got to do the finance
stuff. Finance. You can wait tonight, because that's a Wednesday thing, but
at least if you've got the tracker, we need to use that in the. In the.
The. It's a Wednesday conversation, so we can do it tomorrow morning.
UnknownSpeaker255:36
Yeah, for fun.
UnknownSpeaker155:37
So it's for the. So for the ise. It's validating this, the Excel and then
the mos, and then the other. Well, the other. The slides, anyway.
UnknownSpeaker255:46
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Okay, thanks for.
UnknownSpeaker155:50
All right, talk later.
UnknownSpeaker255:52
Talk later.
UnknownSpeaker155:52
Bye.

m">1. Review and Categorization of BRV/BRV-Adjacent Systems</h3><p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Summary:</strong><br>Significant discussion focu=
sed on validating and aligning the list of Build-Run-Validate (BRV) and BRV=
-adjacent systems across business functions. The group compared sources fro=
m older and current decks, Smartsheets, Excel trackers, and process owner n=
otes to ensure accurate system categorization. There were concerns about in=
consistencies in the &quot;heat map&quot; and system tagging, particularly =
for the Data Intelligence and Finance categories.</p>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Validation of 22 key systems from UAT planning and kickoff decks.</li>
<li>Identification of mismatches: e.g., Snowflake not appearing, CCEX apps =
mistakenly included, discrepancies due to improper heatmap tagging.</li>
<li>Agreement to confirm BRV/BRV-adjacent categorizations using Smartsheet =
trackers and through upcoming calls with subject matter experts (e.g., Raje=
sh for data systems, finance leads for finance apps).</li>
<li>Recognition that some systems may have been incorrectly included due to=
 auto-pulled data from project plans (e.g., CCEX, Live Without systems).</l=
i>
</ul>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Update the tracker to reflect only accurate BRV/BRV-adjacent systems.</=
li>
<li>Validate system mappings in collaboration with process and IT owners.</=
li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">2. Finance=
, HR, and Other Functional Systems Mapping</h3><p><strong style=3D"font-wei=
ght:bold">Summary:</strong><br>Detailed mapping and validation exercise for=
 Finance, HR, ERP, and Supply Chain systems marked as BRV or adjacent. Focu=
s was on ensuring completeness with respect to lists received from the vari=
ous BU/process owners.</p>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identified seven core Finance systems, with versions and aliases (e.g.,=
 Hyperion, Blackline, SAP BI, Power BI, Workiva, FDS).</li>
<li>Some HR systems (PeopleSoft, ADP Celergo) discussed for their Day 1 imp=
act vs. longer-term replacement (e.g., Honeywell HCM).</li>
<li>Confirmed that some SAP instances, Concur, and other supporting systems=
 should be classified as BRV or adjacent, based on business dependencies.</=
li>
<li>Clarified that some systems (e.g., specific portals) were misclassified=
 or duplicated in initial lists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Engage respective business owners (e.g., Wednesday call with HR) to con=
firm and finalize system lists.</li>
<li>Clarify and update status of systems where ambiguity exists (BRV vs. Li=
ve Without).</li>
</ul>

<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">3. Data In=
tegrity and Status Tracking in System Inventory</h3><p><strong style=3D"fon=
t-weight:bold">Summary:</strong><br>The meeting addressed the need for rigo=
rous data management in the system inventory, especially for test planning =
and ownership tracking.</p>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of erroneous BRV tagging, especially for legacy/default =
entries (e.g., Autodesk, eFax, automation tools).</li>
<li>Importance stressed on accurate reflection of system status, KT (knowle=
dge transfer) status, and business function mapping.</li>
<li>Emphasis on updating and syncing the tracker and Smartsheets before sta=
keholder meetings.</li>
<li>Clarified dropdown values for KT status (Complete, Not Started, In Prog=
ress, N/A).</li>
<li>Dates for SIT and UAT phases should be driven by validated inputs, not =
by inherited heat map values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reconcile tracker fields (system status, KT status, test timelines) wit=
h validated source data before calls.</li>
<li>Assign clear ownership for maintaining these updates.</li>
</ul>

t criteria and associated templates for use across business functions. This=
 included aligning on roles and responsibilities, data requirements, test e=
nvironments, and sign-off procedures.</p>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Entry criteria include having testers, completed SIT, ALM tool setup, t=
est data/environment readiness, scenario identification, and approvals.</li=
>
<li>Exit criteria comprise all tests executed, defect management, documenta=
tion, completed sign-offs, and readiness to proceed to cutover.</li>
<li>Template prepared for presentation and validation with business SMEs.</=
li>
<li>Discussion around process for reviewing, customizing, and adopting crit=
eria across different functions.</li>
<li>Plan to review criteria in upcoming alignment sessions and capture feed=
back.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place most up-to-date criteria and guidance documents in a new shared f=
older (=E2=80=9CBRV Alignment=E2=80=9D).</li>

ion (e.g., &quot;MOs&quot; or Modes of Operations slides).</li>
<li>Plan to align UAT activities and timelines with this cadence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finalize and communicate the draft cadence, ensuring all relevant stake=
holders are included.</li>
<li>Send explicit communication, removing UAT as a generic agenda item and =
distributing it as a focused message.</li>

we should have this for supply chain. We should also do this for other, you=

at&#39;s step number one. We should do a live thing. There are so many othe=
