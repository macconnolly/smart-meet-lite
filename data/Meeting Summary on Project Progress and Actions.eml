0:00
A ton to like, just like, oh, you want this Excel, a copy of this Excel and=
 it's not that difficult. Then I wouldn't see it being an issue. But this =
morning I was looking at the sheet and we have six completely done, like =
tested, copied in the site, like signed off by both sides. So I'm going to =
send out an email just so that I can get that PDF. I'm going to get that =
PDF sent out an email so I can get that solidified and then at least we're =
done. Done with at least six.

0:32
That's great. That's really good. Hey =
Amber, just I guess a quick one. Do you know how we've got tasks? Like =
we've got the. I don't know what kind of chart that is, to be honest. It's =
kind of like a horizontal bar chart. We've got it by tasks that essentially=
. Are we able to do that for apps now that we've got a couple complete to =
test that chart out?

0:59
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1:01
Am I making sense? So =
I'm sick over the weekend, so my head's just a bit clogged, but essentially=
 it's. I think it's the app volume one.

1:10
Yeah.

1:14
No, sorry, I lie. If you go to work. Plan, task report.

1:19
No, this is the extended report you're talking about this one, right?

1:24
I actually want the third one.

1:26
Sorry, the third one?

1:29
Yeah, the second, second one.

1:33
Second one, yeah.

1:34
So are we able to get this by. No, no, that was it. If you, if we ever get =
that view by apps and I think you've done this before already. No, no, no, =
the third one.

1:48
The third. Oh yeah, this one.

1:50
So Parry's just said, right, like if in the top, right? Barry, you've just =
said that Bangalore is now what, 6 of 86 complete?

1:59
Uh huh. Okay.

2:00
Yeah.

2:03
And because I think, I don't know if this is feasible, =
Amber, if it's a whole heap of work, don't worry about it. But this is the =
view that Despina is dying to see. She can't correlate tasks to apps. And =
like we could be 98% done, but we technically made. We could not have any =
sign offs done. You know what I mean? Like, that's where she's just getting=
 nervous. So just, just something to think about. Sorry, I didn't mean to. =
I just wanted to shoot to this view because I. That's where Dispina is. =
Like, well, how many apps have we done? I don't care about your task count.=
 Like, I don't. It's like, what have you signed Sealed and delivered. And =
that's kind of. Sorry, I just. I had to sort of. Because that question's =
coming soon. Right, Right. Yeah.

2:56
Okay. So, yeah, basically what I'm =
doing, I'm. I'm taking the app count here from our master, the Excel file.

3:07
So maybe if.

3:08
Yeah. So if we can create a column there and if we =
can start similarly, I can do that. Like, similarly, what we have done, =
like, loaded into Capital Edge. I can do that completed, something like =
that, and then pull that status here so it can give us how many are =
completed out of that particular site.

3:32
Yeah, that would be good. =
Because I just think that's what we're going to deliver apps, we don't =
really have to deliver tasks. So I think that's the thing. Sorry, Perry. =
You can continue. Just.

3:48
One thing, though. So if this is pulling from=
 the Master, I actually think that that might be better because that means =
that that's the correct number of, like, four chan applications within that=
 list. Right. So in theory, I don't need to get all the Fortran tasks =
within Capital Edge. Right. Because then that wouldn't. No, I still feel =
like the Fortran task would still be representative of the Book of Work =
that we're doing for Fortran, which currently is the eight tasks we have in=
 Capital Edge, which isn't as representative. So what do you want to do =
there, Annie? So yesterday I had asked Umbert to add in the 4chan tasks =
within capital Edge. And I know, Umber, you haven't gotten there yet =
because you're a little confused. No worries at all. We can talk about it. =
But how do we want to represent like that? So we're basically missing like.=
 Like, we just have a Fortran section of, like, the eight tasks that =
represent all of Fortran in Capital Edge versus the 62 line items we =
actually do have in our Master. Does that make sense?

5:03
I'm not sure. The question is.

5:05
The question is, how do I represent =
the Book of Work for Fortran? Do we want it in Capital Edge or do we keep =
it in the Master? And the number of applications that gets done still gets =
updated in that view that Umber is doing because it's connected to the =
Master and not capital Ed.

5:29
Okay. Is the question to add things into =
Cafe Join up. Sorry.

5:34
Okay, I can explain. So what Perry is asking =
right now, for all the 62 Fortran application, we have this section =
dedicated to Fortran, which is signifying all the 62 applications under =
Fortran scripts. So what? She's asking whether we should create 62 line =
items for each of the Individual Fortran applications or in C. Or we just =
mark it as completed in the master for the completion or the representation=
 perspective.

6:05
What's the source of the completion?

6:11
The master. Right. So the source of the completion. Amber, if you go back =
to the power bi, that's the. You said that this is pulling from our master,=
 right? Our Excel.

6:25
So this number the total apps is pulling from =
Master. Yeah, yeah. So here, whatever completion is there, we have to do it=
 in master. But like wherever you are seeing this difference, this is =
pulling from the capital H. This is from Master. That's why there is a =
difference in applications. Oh no, no, no, no. Sorry. For all the =
applications I am pulling the values from master, not capital H. So that's =
why you are seeing the number is 438. If we go to this view, this is the =
Total number of application 371. This is pulling from capital S. That's why=
 we see a difference in number. And that's why I. I published a note at the=
 bottom as well. Makes sense.

7:19
No, it does. I guess just add in Kep =
Edge should be the source for what we get marked as complete.

7:27
Yeah.

7:28
So if we just need to load in a singular task for each of the =
remaining items then we can do that. Perfect. Cool. As long as it's a five =
minute task then I'm good with it. If it takes any longer than that then we=
 can just manage it offline. Cuz it should be done this week, right? Par.

7:47
Yeah, that's the goal. But Fortran tends to keep me up at night so I =
don't know man, I'm hoping, I am hoping with my fingers crossed and I pray,=
 I pray, hopefully it gets it. Okay.

8:02
So yeah, so I guess. And guys, =
anything that gets delayed now is an actual risk. Like we've only got four =
or five weeks to go and we have zero buffer now with any of this stuff. So =
it's gotta be like it's. It's substance over form right now. Like if we =
have to do task three instead before task two, I don't care. Let's just get=
 it done. Because I feel like what would. Like what I'm seeing in a lot of =
different areas is like valerian really frustrates me. They waited so long =
to do a copy and then they worked out they couldn't do it. Right. Like it's=
 just terrible anyway. Like it's just. So let's just do as much as we can =
and then we'll do a little bit of cleanup and sign offs after the fact or =
whatever. We need to do, but I just want to make sure we can get it done. =
So I just sort of end with that there. But it sounds like we've got six on =
the go for India so that's good.

9:02
Agreement. Yeah.

9:05
So Amber, what's Harry, anything else coming out of India Bengal we need to=
 discuss?

9:13
Not yet. Nothing. Nothing really. I just want to get =
alignment with Gopi and Mohan tomorrow. But the individual teams are =
already working it and going in and doing the actual testing and sign offs.=
 I'm just going to go get that email confirmation of the six done. So at =
least that's buttoned off and then I can put that into Capital Edge and =
we'll continue pushing it. Nothing that I need to raise just yet.

9:44
Yeah. Which is hopefully good.

9:46
Knock on wood. Crossing my fingers. =
Nothing yet.

9:51
Yeah. Okay. And do they know it's due end of week?

9:57
Yeah. So Gopi wants it done end of week two and, and like this might be an =
issue. I don't know. And correct me if I'm wrong, Amber, there is a, there =
is a Indian holiday on Thursday.

10:11
Yes, it's holiday. Yeah, yeah, yeah=
.

10:15
And then Mohan just told us that a lot of people are taking Friday=
 off as well because of that.

10:23
So I think that's, that's okay. As =
long as we're up in the 60 70s by that day, I think we're all right. If =
we're sitting at 2030, then that's a really big issue. Sort of. Amber, are =
there like, how's it being done? Are they just working it out between =
themselves when they do it or is there scheduled sessions?

10:46
So I'm hopeful that they are doing a working session together. I have not =
received any email communication on that.

10:56
I'm just thinking, Barry, =
is it worth putting time on the calendar and be like, hey guys, like this =
is a, an allotted slot that works for this and don't want to micromanage =
but I just want to give them the option like, hey, this is a good time to =
do it based on your calendar.

11:14
Yep. And we can probably do it like =
India time and Umber can like.

11:18
Yeah, yeah.

11:20
So what I did is I actually went to their live sheet and I put in due dates=
 on all of them. So it's. So they're. Well like they're in the she and =
they're seeing that, hey, we want to get this done, we want to get this =
done asap. So I did that. I did that prioritization per what we talked =
about Friday and I think that's what kind of is pushing people to get =
things done. And maybe it's going to be more than six. So I just checked =
six this morning, but there's a chance people are continuing to do it.

11:55
Any chance I can get access to that Excel or.

11:58
No, it's on the college side.

12:01
And you cannot give access to my ey.

12:05
No, yeah, I can, I can continue giving you offline like copies but. =
And I can share screen, but no.

12:14
I was just thinking like during =
daytime. Are they making any progress? I can do a pulse check and then =
probably I can shoot an email to Pradeep. That's what I was.

12:23
You know what we can do?

12:25
You know those GDS resources that do have =
IDs, I can give them access and then you can kind of keep in touch with the=
 GDS EY team and they can keep an eye for you. That might be an option.

12:44
Okay, let's talk after this call. Yeah. That themselves are burdened =
with task and work.

12:50
So you can look at a sheet once.

12:53
Okay.

12:53
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's see.

12:59
Okay.

13:03
Okay. Sorry, Paris, what were you saying?

13:08
No, I just want to know =
what holiday it was.

13:11
So it's. It's in Bangalore. It's Bangalore Day =
or Karnataka Day, so to say. And for us North Indians it's Labor Day, so =
yeah, so it's almost kind of a national holiday. Not national, but yeah, =
like public holiday for all these states in India.

13:35
Cool. Okay, never mind. That's all I had. And you're asking something?

13:41
No, no, I think Topango is in pretty good check. How's Brookford =
looking?

13:47
Rockford is actually also not doing too bad. I'm more so =
worried about the cats and dogs. Like the solution business manager just =
got is. Is the buyer solution data extract. And that's one application =
where I'm like, I don't have a actual user. So Bangalore uses the legacy =
information but the database is maintained by Rockford. And I just got =
Rachel Cunningham as a person so that I need a. I need to figure out in =
terms of doors dots complete pending testing from Adam. I'm doing working =
sessions almost every day just because I think Paul and Devendra and Adam =
just kind of need time to just go through it and they wouldn't make time =
otherwise. So Synergy is actually going well. We did a working session on =
Friday where we set up the project and Adam wanted to do it. So we, again, =
we just need more time. So I set up more time today and then so that's =
going well. We actively already identified what needs to be moved and we're=
 going to do it live together that way. We're. You know, everyone has eyes =
on it. And then in terms of the copied, Chase sent back a Excel with where =
everything lives, and a lot of them they already have access to and it's =
already on their site. So we need to make sure that it still gets signed =
off and there's someone on the call inside who will review it. Just because=
 Chase says that he has it doesn't mean. You know, I still think we. We =
still need both sides, right? So. So yeah. And then Fortran. Of course.

15:48
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Maybe let's do a deep. Like a bit of a =
deep dive into Rockford this afternoon just to make sure we are tracking =
good. What about. So that's that non functional. Sorry? Non functional. I =
keep saying that. Non engineering. I think we did a few bespoke calls this =
week on. Tim. I'll catch up with you. How's your ankle? What happened?

16:15
I don't flipping clue. Like yesterday I was playing with the kids and=
 the niece and nephews and. Sorry. Saturday I was doing that. Everything =
was fine. Yesterday I finally got to build the fence for my blueberry farm =
and laid down and ate it. Just started swelling up and got no sleep and =
just killing me. I don't know what the hell it is.

16:42
Damn. Even with ice, it still keeps going up.

16:47
Yeah. I remember last night. I got no sleep. I was tossing turn. I could =
not find a comfortable spot. Anytime it moved.

16:55
Yeah.

16:56
But I'll figure it out.

16:57
Inside or outside.

17:02
It's. It's almost like the tendon. It's right. Right at the ankle, the =
front part of the foot.

17:09
Oh. Like when you lift your foot up and that=
 thing pops up like that tendon don't pop up. Yeah, like you kick something=
. It.

17:18
I have no flipping clue. It's just swollen and like, I've had =
bad ankle sprains before. There's no discoloration. It's not broken, but =
it's just. Can't put any weight on it. It'll be fun going through the =
airport tonight.

17:32
Yeah. Get it checked out before you do because if =
it's something bad, you get a severe cankle coming into you, you don't get =
canked up. He's still gonna.

17:43
Still gonna crush us all at golf =
tomorrow.

17:47
That tomorrow or Thursday. I don't know, Wednesday.

17:49
It's just a joke. I'm sure it's at some point.

17:54
It's a simulation golf. So we're gonna be fine for Wednesday night. All =
right. That's what you're talking about?

18:01
Yeah, sure.

18:03
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Tim, if you could get it checked out like that. Be really. =
I don't know how it works, but aren't like, don't feet like swell up when =
you're like flying and stuff too? That's. Yeah, I'll figure it out.

18:20
I'll see what the doctor says, see what the diagnosis is and go from there.=
 That's all I can do.

18:28
Yeah. Oh, let us know what happens, man.

18:31
Okay.

18:32
And then. Yeah, we'll. We'll go from there. Yeah. Okay.

18:38
So as far as non engineering hr, I'm not worried about. We're not =
going to copy over the. The Indonesia apps. We're just gonna get legal on =
that one just to get sign off because there's nothing they need and then =
there's just some cats and dogs that are the other ones. So we got server =
monkey off the comms list. I think everything else is. Is going fine with =
that one.

19:00
Yeah.

19:01
I'll get the list together for you. It's the =
awesome ones that I'm probably.

19:03
Does that mean we got more change =
requests now?

19:07
Sorry?

19:08
Does that mean we've got more change =
requests now?

19:14
No, the disposition is the same, but it's already =
hosted in Indonesia for the HR applications, so it's copying over there. =
We're just not doing the reverse copy back to columns.

19:26
Okay. Okay.

19:29
It's like the. It's like their TSA logical separation application, =
which is already logically separated.

19:37
Yeah.

19:38
Based on individual, not. Not anything else. So I'm not changing =
dispositions on that. I'm like, yep, technically it's already logically =
separated. We're good.

19:47
Yeah. No. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Let us know sort =
of what happens because we. Well, you're on the call with Chandra. Yeah, =
Yeah, I just. She's. I think she's just agitated because of like what's =
going on at the deal level right now. And any changes to her just seem to =
irk her a little bit. So we just need to be cognizant of that. The one =
thing that I'm kicking myself, and I don't know why I didn't bring it up, =
is the apps we're flipping from dedicated transfer to dedicated tsa. I =
didn't raise that with her at all and I don't know why.

20:27
With covering with Jose. I think we're good.

20:30
Yeah. I think it is at the deal level. She just needs to know. So I might =
just have to ping her, unfortunately. But yeah, it would have been a good =
time, especially while it's just her. When you have the rest of the SML on =
the Corp dev team on they tend to. Someone raises an issue, and everyone =
just sort of comes off the top rope trying to make it a bigger issue. It's =
just what they do. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. And then. So I think that's that=
. And then I'll. Did we. It's Friday afternoon. I was starting to get sick,=
 and I can't actually remember what we did Friday afternoon. The app =
inventory. Is that updated, Perry?

21:19
Yeah, the app inventory tab is =
updated, and I know tab was. Tim was gonna take a look at the other tab.

21:26
Okay.

21:27
Yeah, yeah.

21:28
It's starting to pull some stuff in. =
Mac, I'm probably gonna need your help just to kind of get everything over =
the line. I know you did a lot of work on that last week, but we took out =
the ones that we didn't agree with that we didn't connect with Chandra on.

21:41
Okay.

21:41
So I've had to pull in a new app list, so we can go over=
 real quick. I just made a copy and said update, so we just need to make =
sure we got the right formulas. Pulling stuff in.

21:51
Yeah, I pasted as value, so hopefully we don't have formulas left. But I do=
 hear what you're saying for the app inventory for all of the disposition =
changes. We had written those. And then, Tim, if you just let me know which=
 ones you did and did not show to Chandra, we can talk about next steps =
there, too.

22:14
Yeah.

22:14
So the app inventory is correct. That's got=
 everything that we showed and did not show to Chandra.

22:20
Perfect.

22:20
So, yeah, that's the golden copy. I know you had your app to contract=
 mapping, and then I have an app to contract mapping update that I was kind=
 of creating some formulas and pulling some stuff in. So if you don't mind =
looking at that, because there's a few contracts that didn't get pulled in =
and that kind of stuff.

22:36
Yeah.

22:36
Yeah, definitely.

22:38
Thank you.

22:44
Okay, so that's how that goes. We'll keep on keeping on. =
Amber, where's today? On here? Monday, 20th of April. We've only got 10 =
tasks due. Okay, that's good.

23:00
One thing I was going through just, =
like, some of the tasks in general for the TSA applications. Like the tsa, =
no action. I believe one of the tasks is to start drafting up =
communications that we would send, if I remember this correctly. And some =
of those. So for Bangalore, some, like, we do have a ton of TSA =
applications. What. How do we have. We kind of thought about how we want to=
 get those comms out. I say that because those tasks are coming up. Just =
tsa, no action. There are tasks Related to. And I think it would be in =
Bangalore Umber if it might be easier for you to.

23:58
I'm just thinking do we actually. Are we even responsible for that? So =
generally like generally in deals you don't like we are communicating more =
with the perimeter than we usually would. Because this is such a cluster I =
would say by way of us sharing the final disposition listing with Stevie is=
 our communication. Like it's on her and Alex and Andy and Mohan. Mohan may=
 not have the list. He does.

24:36
He has his own like Bangalore list.

24:39
What do you mean his own?

24:44
This week. But yeah, I'll push Chris=
 and Alex in that team to kind of start drafting communications.

24:52
Yeah, yeah. Because I'm just thinking like I don't think that's on us to =
technically do like we. We don't want to get into like us being the comms =
channel and everything that you've like a comms with. Let me take an act =
like can you put that on the tactical list for me Harry is just understand =
comms requirements for TS8 applications. Is it my history? Yeah. It might =
just be a simple what's changing what's not kind of thing. But let me just =
take that. When are they coming due? Ensure actuation and continued access.

25:31
Yeah. Like literally starting in two days.

25:37
Which one?

25:38
Up top. Under notepad. Bangalore Fire solution no action. Develop =
communications to users stating access will be revoked on day one. Plan due=
 date in two days.

25:54
Yeah, I think we go via the Stevie route here and=
 leverage. And leverage her because I don't think it's on us to communicate=
 to all the users like Stevie. That's literally your job in this and I know=
 she's got a ton of other jobs but yeah, fair. Like we can't get stuck in =
the. Hey, did you. Did the three people sitting in this office we don't =
know about get this communication? Like we don't get stuck in that. As long=
 as we're clear around like hey, we gave. I think this is the way it's =
going to play. As long as we're clear that hey, we gave this to Stevie to =
communicate out like our job's done.

26:42
Makes sense.

26:43
Yeah, I'll work with him on that and yeah, that'll flow.

26:48
Nice.

26:48
Because I'm. They're scheduling a meeting with Mohan and Rockford =
hopefully for Wednesday. I gotta push them to start doing that now just so =
that CD has understanding of tracking.

27:01
Okay. I guess the other thing=
 as well is that like I feel like everyone's. I feel like they're all =
engaged but in. Does Stevie know how much we're speaking with Mohan and =
Adam and Chase.

27:17
I don't think she, she realizes it. I've talked to =
Alex saying that it's being worked, but she just doesn't have visibility on=
 what's been done and what's not. She's probably seen the, the Bangalore =
tracker, but I don't think she's seen. We don't necessarily have a tracker =
for Rockford so. But I think they're going to use the. Our centralized. The=
 one that I kind of drafted for them just to kind of say hey guys, can you =
update this so that we know where we're at and where we're behind?

27:51
Yeah.

27:51
And so both her and Andy will have. Have some understanding of=
, of what's going on because right now I don't think they have any.

27:58
Yeah. And that's not unusual for the in perimeter teams. Like that's always=
 a big. It's not good for change management but it's how this deal team =
likes to operate. Just keep them in the dark and don't let them ask =
questions. It's not really the secret to success I guess. Like Perry, you =
remember from Hornet, right. Like getting access to perimeter was very =
difficult.

28:22
Yeah. Yeah. It raised a lot of concerns if, if you =
reached out to the perimeter for sure.

28:29
Yeah, you can get killed. =
Which is why we're kind of like. Which is why like I don't love not having =
someone from Collins with us like every step of the journey in case =
something comes up. But so guys, whatever we do, just let's only ever share=
 like make sure that I've seen every file that gets shared with Saffron. =
Sorry with actuation like that's, that's kind of a non negotiable just to =
make sure that we're not putting something out there that shouldn't be put =
out there because that would get us in a, that would get us killed in, in =
this situation. And that's why so team the other one. So team, anytime we =
invite actuation to a call make sure you put dispina at like make sure =
there's commons people on it. Right. Ey can't have a call directly with the=
 perimeter. Like that puts us in a pretty bad like if we, if they don't =
join that's okay, but as long as they're invited and they're included then =
then we're good. I just don't want to have like a. Ey's been doing all =
these calls with the prover that no one knew about. Like that's a, like =
those Kind of words blow up quickly and people are pretty dramatic here, as=
 you know. So just a heads up on.

29:51
On that one anti the working =
sessions that I'm doing, just like with Paul, Devendra and Adam. Those are =
like, fine though, right? Like, I can continue having that.

30:02
Yeah, but you've got Tori and all those, don't you?

30:05
Not on the working sessions. I don't have Tori on that.

30:09
Just put her as optional on those. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just put her in =
dispena as optional. They won't join. Yeah, but just put her. Just put them=
 as optional.

30:19
Okay.

30:21
And like, well, I'll tell Tori tomorrow. =
Like, hey, for visibility, we're going to put you on these meetings because=
 then if no one joins, for example, and we're not having that issue, but if=
 they don't, we can forward it to Tori and say, tori, no one's joining. =
Need you to escalate. And she doesn't mind escalating. So that's her. Sure.

30:46
I'll. I'll add pouring this demand to my working sessions.

30:52
Okay. All right, cool. Is there anything else that we need to try? It seems=
 like we're actually on okay with Cap Edge stuff, which took us a bit to =
get there, but we. We. We did get there in the end. Any. Anything else we =
need to discuss on. No, we're good. Okay. Right, Mac, are you good to still=
 join the Polarian calls? We need to watch that one super closely. I'm a =
bit nervous that they just. This. That was so. Like, they haven't done =
anything since we left. Yeah. So if we can just sort of ask the why can't =
we do this quicker? Like, what are we waiting for? Kind of stuff, like, =
without being ourselves, obviously. But, like, I honestly don't know what =
they've done in the last four. Four or five weeks since we left.

32:02
Yeah, absolutely.

32:04
So, yeah, if you could just sort of ask questions =
on that, that'd be. That'd be good. Yep. Cool. Alrighty. Well, have a good =
week, everyone. I'm sure I'll catch up with each of you sort of =
individually throughout the day. Sounds great.

32:19
Thank you.

32:20
Cheers, guys.

32:22
See y'all tomorrow.
