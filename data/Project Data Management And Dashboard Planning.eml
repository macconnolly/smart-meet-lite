*Project Data Management & Dashboard Design Meeting (June 12, 2025)*
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Data Ownership and System Usage

   - *Smartsheets Ownership:* Confirmed that Misumi and her team manage and
   own Smartsheets, which holds detailed work plan data.
   - *Capital Edge:* Used for high-level work planning; detailed tracking
   remains in Smartsheets to avoid duplicative effort.
   - *Leadership Support:* Decision to use Smartsheets for details is
   supported to streamline process and prevent double entry.

2. Data Structure and Field Definitions

   - *Owner/Lead Field:*
      - Questioned text vs. dropdown format.
      - Chose text fields due to user access constraints with Capital Edge.
   - *Functions Field:*
      - Discussion about dropdowns with multi-select vs. comma-delimited
      vs. separate columns.
      - Decision: Use separate columns for primary, secondary, tertiary
      functions to support dashboard use and import/export robustness.
      - Dropdown options to be based on existing lists such as "functional
      status".
   - *Sub Function:*
      - To be text field, since sub-functions are not always consistent.
   - *KT (Knowledge Transfer), SIT, SAT, UAT Fields:*
      - Wanted to minimize number of data inputs for users.
      - Decided on adding:
         - KT status and KT target date as distinct fields.
         - SIT status and UAT fields (start, end, status).
      - Agreed that status fields (e.g., "delayed start") should be
      calculated based on start date and progress.

3. Status Calculations & Metrics

   - *Delayed Start:* Calculated based on not started when past start date.
   - *At Risk/Behind Schedule:* At risk is a manual status; 'behind
   schedule' is calculated.
   - *Metrics:* Need to show counts for various statuses (delayed, on
   track, not started, completed) for dashboarding.
   - *Burn Down & Waterfall Charts:* Required for visualizing planned vs.
   actual project progression.

4. Data Source Alignment & Integration

   - *Source of UAT Dates:* Confirmed that app-level dates are managed in
   Smartsheets, not linked to project-level work plans, matching intentiona=
l
   design for flexibility.
   - *Data Consistency:* Where discrepancies exist, use the most recently
   confirmed source; prioritize reusing existing data to minimize additiona=
l
   user work.

5. Timeline and Deliverables

   - *Immediate Need:* Stakeholder working session scheduled today,
   requiring at least a basic summary/dashboard.
   - *Short-term Timeline:*
      - *By June 13, 2025:* Aim to have summarized KPI/counts
      (Wireframe/Table View) ready for stakeholder review.
      - *By June 16=E2=80=9317, 2025:* Expected completion of more complex
      dashboard elements (e.g., burndown charts), depending on BI resource
      availability and feedback/testing.
   - *Resource Constraints:* Burndown chart logic is noted as complex,
   typically taking 12-16 hours. Primary BI resource for this available.

------------------------------
Action Items & Follow-Ups

   1. *Finalize Field Definitions:* Update data structure to use separate
   columns for functions, set required fields, and finalize dropdown option
   lists.
   2. *Data Sourcing Verification:* Confirm original sources for owner, UAT
   dates, and other key fields. Include Pre for confirmation about CMDB-ori=
gin
   columns.
   3. *Dashboard Build:*
      - Prepare initial KPI/count metrics and table view for June 13.
      - Communicate with stakeholders in session today about what will be
      shown in v0.
      - Proceed with burndown and waterfall logic for target completion
      early next week.
   4. *Status Calculations:* Implement logic for "delayed start", "not
   started", and clarifications for overlapping statuses.
   5. *Communication:*
      - Notify team this afternoon on progress and any questions.
      - Maintain transparency about deliverable timelines and adjust as
      needed.

------------------------------
Additional Notes

   - User experience for data entry is a priority; repetitive requests for
   info are causing frustration, so keep new asks minimal.
   - The summary counts for certain statuses may overlap (e.g., "delayed
   start" and "not started") =E2=80=94 sum totals should be clearly explain=
ed to
   stakeholders to avoid confusion.
   - If needed, temporary dashboards/tables can be built in Excel for
   short-term visibility while BI tools and full dashboards are under
   development.

------------------------------
Next Steps

   - Update and agree on data templates.
   - Share initial summary/KPIs by tomorrow.
   - Full dashboard expected early next week, pending feedback and testing.

Brian0:00
Smart Sheets is this one that Misumi and her team is actually owning and
managing?
Unspecified colleague0:06
I think so, probably.
Brian0:07
Okay, so from their perspective, they do kind of like a high level work
plan in Capital Edge, but their kind of nitty gritty details are all still
housed in Smartsheets. And that was the functional team's choice, supported
by leadership. Just so that way they're not managing the same thing in two
different places, but also that they're not making a huge effort to try to
bring them into Capital Edge.
Unspecified colleague0:33
Yeah, and that was kind of our concern with this one as well, is trying to
avoid that. We don't want them to have to go and edit in multiple different
places, you know, ideally. So were you able to take a look at that file
that I sent you?
Brian0:55
Yep. So I've got it pulled up here. Everything's pretty straightforward. So
just a couple questions on it. Owner lead, do we want these as dropdowns or
text fields? And the reason I ask is owner and Capital Edge is typically
driven by who has access. So if we're going to assign people who don't have
access to Capital Edge, I would advise us to go with a text field.
Unspecified colleague1:18
So text. Yeah.
Brian1:20
Okay. Functions in the system, again, you can either do a drop down or a
text field. The biggest thing is I see we've got multiple.
Unspecified colleague1:31
Can we do a drop down with multiple selects?
Brian1:34
We can, but it breaks the import export process.
Unspecified colleague1:37
Oh shit. Okay. And I know the import export limit.
Brian1:41
We can still do it that way if we. What if we use comma delimitation like
here in ISC and Finance.
Unspecified colleague1:47
Yeah, we.
Brian1:48
We can use that and still pull.
Unspecified colleague1:50
It to the dashboard. Okay. I mean, or we could have. Because I want to give
them a standard list of things to choose from, kind of. And there's. In any
of these, I think we only have a maximum of two. Right. So like
theoretically we could have function one like dependent function one and
then another column is dependent function two and dependent function three
just in case and then manipulate that however we need across the backend.
What is easier the comma separated if you delimit them by commas and import
it that way. Or separate the columns, I think separating.
Brian2:31
The columns and then also drive a consistent experience. So if we look at
BRV and I'll use process as the example function is going to be that
dropdown because it's tied to a project team and we'll just make multiple
iterations of that column with only one being like a required field. But
then sub function we have as a text Field because they're not always
consistent and we have a mapping to pull it to the dashboard, things like
that. But that's true now for contract cutover and hiring and system I
think is currently operating that way as well. Yeah, yeah.
Unspecified colleague3:06
Do you have examples of like we could use the same dropdown options that
we're giving them for dependent function.
Brian3:16
Yep. So just if we're going to have two or three, I would say do primary,
secondary, tertiary or whatever naming convention.
Unspecified colleague3:23
And then, but I mean the option like the options in the drop downs, like do
you have an example of like a comprehensive list of what you're giving them
on any of these?
Brian3:32
Like so the easiest way to see that is functional status and it's
everything here.
Unspecified colleague3:36
Okay, perfect.
Brian3:37
So function and project team and Honeywell's case are equivalent.
Unspecified colleague3:42
Okay, perfect.
Brian3:48
And then the other kind of thing that I noticed. So we've got KT status,
sit, sat, uat, UAT uat. Do we need KT dates and do we need an SAT status?
Unspecified colleague4:10
Do we need KT dates? So we had talked about, I talked about with Rakesh
doing like kt, like having it be the, like the target date for KT or the
status. But I guess we can't wrap a date and a status in the same column.
So I would say KT target date or something. I, I want to minimize the
number of, I want to minimize the number of inputs that we're asking for
here just to begin with because they've probably filled out all of this
information before somewhere else and it really, it's starting to frust,
frustrate some of those folks. So maybe just like one KT date, like KT
target date and KT status and then we should add SIT status. Yeah. And then
we have UAT start, UAT end, UAT status.
Brian5:11
Yep. So and then that drives me to the second set of questions. So sic
complete delayed start at risk. When we talk about these delayed start, are
we simply driving and I'll go to system based on the status and it going
into delayed here or do we need to do an actual calculation that says hey,
status is on or not started by the start date is now delayed start.
Unspecified colleague5:42
Yeah, I think we would calculate it.
Brian5:44
Right.
Unspecified colleague5:44
Like it's not started by the start date, it's now delayed start.
Brian5:50
Okay, we can do that. At risk is just a kind of at risk. Same with buying
schedule.
Unspecified colleague5:54
Yeah, exactly.
Brian5:56
So and then behind schedule still on.
Unspecified colleague5:59
Track or something else and delayed. Perfect.
Brian6:04
So does that work?
Unspecified colleague6:06
Yeah, delayed is perfect.
Brian6:07
Okay. All right, so delayed start and then Actual delayed, sat on track,
just on track count, not started count and then what's actually completed.
This is total of everything on the dashboard and then a waterfall burn
down, basically, if I'm understanding this correctly. Yeah. So we used
offer starts.
Unspecified colleague6:25
Yeah, we used planned starts here. Like what? Like when are they going to
be? I mean whatever. Like once we get the data in there. I'm sure that it
depends how it looks and we have a working session with our stakeholders
today to really dig into what they want to show here. So I think we could
do starts. This was the true starts data from that file that I shared with
you. And it's good. Like it tells a good story that the majority of our UAT
is focused in July. Some of it starts in the end of this month and we
should be completely wrapped up by 8:1 with a couple stragglers continuing
on through the fall is kind of the message here that we're trying to
convey. And then the next one is the burn down of just a regular burn down.
Brian7:18
Yeah. So that's pretty simple timing wise. I know we kind of discussed the
high level. When are we looking to have this ready bike?
Unspecified colleague7:27
Well, how busy are you? And I hate when people give me something and say I
need this in 12 hours. But whenever you can get it to me. With the caveat
that we have to review something with them tomorrow. But we'll probably
just do it on our. We can and have the capability to just do it in Excel or
something and give them a dashboard there. It depends on what the
turnaround times look like. And I don't want to disrupt you or your
schedule based on like my lack of planning, you know.
Brian8:04
No, completely get it. So I mean most of the stuff is pretty simple, but
when we get into waterfalls and especially burn downs, the logic can get
pretty complicated.
Unspecified colleague8:14
Yeah.
Brian8:15
And because this isn't a base report project, say work plan and we're going
to be kind of transforming the data as we build this, it won't be ready for
tomorrow.
Unspecified colleague8:28
So do we have. And so here's the question, do we have. So this system
cutover tracker from brb, these UAT start and UAT end dates, are those from
the work plans or are those linked to the project? Because if these are
reported by the work streams on the app level granular basis, then we can
just use these dates.
Brian8:52
Yeah, this is all app level. This has no tie into work plan. And we did
that intentionally.
Unspecified colleague8:58
Yeah.
Brian8:59
So in case. And the way we also set it up so I'm sure I could find an
Example, let's do adp because Rakesh.
Unspecified colleague9:07
Was confused about this and I this is what I was hoping for. Because if
that's the case, then the dates that we have will go through and there are
some that we know we've gotten more confirmation on that might differ from
what's in those columns. To update the dates in those start and end date
columns that you have, would they go into their smartsheet workplace and
update it there or would they go into Cap Edge and update it there? Like
where are those pulled from originally? I don't know originally.
Brian9:48
My assumption would be sourced from the smartsheet, but there's no data
connection between the two.
Unspecified colleague9:53
Okay.
Brian9:56
The other caveat. So in the way it was set up when we talked with three
about it. And I'll just use this one view as an example. If IT and HR both
have this one view system, there are two distinct line items for it. If
there's only one, there's only one. And we did that instead of having two
function columns. So we can keep it this way and keep everything in here or
we can do basically a rip and replace if this isn't the most up to date.
Unspecified colleague10:23
Yeah, I mean I think that that's fine. I would like to use as much of what
we already have as possible. Right. For all of the reasons that we talked
about. So does it make it easier for you if we say we're going to use
everything that we already have from these and just pull views together
just with that additional information on like the status and some of the
things like that? Or is it better to just like keep this self contained in
its own.
Brian10:54
We can do it like this. I'm just looking. I mean a lot of the information
is the same. Right. So we have function, system disposition, function
system disposition, business function. This looks like sub function data
and intelligence. Does that line up here? Data center and networking. So it
may not be an exact one to one, but we can always adjust. This is a text
column too. If we have to again replace things. Owner is already in there.
Unspecified colleague11:38
This came out of that master. We have like somewhere. Again it's a
smartsheet. I don't know what tables there are in it in Cap Edge, but it's
like a smartsheet. That's like Master system inventory tracker. And this
was from cmdb. It was one of the columns from CMDB that they called. I can
get the original naming of it. It was something something something cmdb.
Right. So okay, well I think that's where.
Brian12:06
It would have come from. I Don't want to say 100% for sure it is, but pre
would be able to confirm that.
Unspecified colleague12:12
Yeah. Okay. Okey dokey. Well, yeah, what does the timing look like for you,
at least for some of the counts, maybe excluding the charts. If we had
something with just the counts on it, I think that for them, even a table
view with some of the summary metrics for all of these would be perfectly
sufficient for a view zero version of it.
Brian12:43
Yeah, I was going to say we can probably get a wireframe again. Burndown
may not be fully functional by tomorrow and I'm just making sure I've got
some allocation for the preferred BI resource. I do. All right, so we
should be able to get the KPI kind of count metrics into place. Hopefully
should be able to do more. Typically burndowns take 12 to 16 hours. She's
also the one that's kind of the wizard with burn downs and is able to knock
them out. So I would conservatively say yes, we'll have the KPIs and then
probably Monday, maybe Tuesday, depending on testing and feedback for the
remainder of the report.
Unspecified colleague13:26
Yeah, that would be so, so great.
Brian13:30
Okay.
Unspecified colleague13:32
Okay. Well, yeah, so let me know. Maybe just shoot me a ping this afternoon
if you have any questions. I'll be on the whole rest of the day and then
let me know what progress she's able to make. And again, Brian, I really
appreciate you jumping in and helping on this.
Brian13:49
Yep, absolutely. And then one other question that I had just to be sure
I've got this. So we've got the delayed start and the not start started. Do
we care if there's overlap between the two? And the reason I ask is delayed
start will look for anything that's not started by its start date, but that
would also be encompassing things that are just not started.
Unspecified colleague14:10
Anyway, I think that that's fine that there's overlap. We will just caveat
it with the sum total is not going to. We're not driving towards like a
concrete number of apps as long as at some point we align on what is that
sum total of all of those counts look like and it doesn't change the total
as we go week over week. I think that it will be fine. Right.
Brian14:37
Okay. And that's basically what I was going to ask is. Okay, so. And we
can. I mean, delayed start would be the only one that wouldn't go into the
total count because everything else would be inclusive of that. That would
just be the caveat number. That's like, hey, this is. Yeah, things that
should have been started in arm. Yeah.
Unspecified colleague14:54
Easy.
Brian14:56
So, all right.
Unspecified colleague14:56
Perfect. Okie dokie. Thank you so much, Brian.
Brian14:59
Absolutely. Thanks, man.
Unspecified colleague14:59
I appreciate the time. Thanks. Bye.
Brian15:01
Thanks.
Unspecified colleague15:04
Oh, yay. That is such good news.
