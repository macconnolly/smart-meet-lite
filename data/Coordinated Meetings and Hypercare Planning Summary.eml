Jen0:00
Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday morning at 11 Eastern. Actually you know what
les workshops happening then. So later in the day probably at 11 Eastern.
Unknown Male10:23
Tuesday 17th 1 Eastern.
Jen0:25
17Th 1 Eastern with the same set of people in my invite. Actually you may
not have that. Right. So because I set the invite up I don't know if you
will get a full view of everybody there. So let me, let me do this, let me
reply so that you get a view of.
Unknown Male10:50
I have a ton of people on here.
Jen0:53
Yeah, so that's fine. Have a ton of people. It's okay. Let them all show up=
.
Unknown Male10:58
I mean I think I have.
Jen1:02
So this is the two and this is the copy. So there are two lists here. I
just sent you that. So you should have the people in the two and people in
the copy.
Unknown Male11:17
One eastern. Do you want to go an hour?
Jen1:23
Yeah, yeah, yes. Eleven whatever time for an hour.
Unknown Male11:29
Yeah, after les. Perfect. Okay.
Jen1:40
One to two eastern.
Unknown Male11:41
Yeah.
Jen1:43
Call it follow up finance it Alignment placeholder For now we can, we can
define the agenda tomorrow.
Unknown Other2:12
It.
Jen2:51
Then when you're done with all of that we should talk about two more items.
One for hr, what we need to do for tomorrow and then the BRV do this. Why
did you send these for now my other ask of you. So notes and everything
else for the finance stuff and then the follow up meeting for finance on
the 17th.
Unknown Male13:21
That'S just hit your inbox in just a second.
Jen3:24
Okay. Now also do this. We should need to, we should talk to Sriram and see
if we should also see if supply chain needs a follow up.
Unknown Male13:47
They likely do.
Jen3:48
I think after all the conversations there's still some pending items so we
should follow up on the 17th and see if they've closed all of this out or
where they are either on the 17th or the 18th. So why don't you do this
also set up on the 18th. 18th is not necessarily a good day but geez.
Actually you know what? Yeah, do it for the 18th at 10:00am Eastern.
Unknown Male14:42
Could you send me the two informatives that you have and the invite from
ISC?
Jen4:48
Yes, ISE was yesterday, right?
Unknown Male14:50
Yeah, it was yesterday at 10:00.
Jen4:52
So here, let me reply all then. Everybody here in the two lane is the first
one and everybody the CC lane is the second the other case. Okay, same
thing. Call it follow up alignment session and some of these folks in
supply chain are in India so that time would work.
Unknown Other6:04
It.
Jen6:33
Got it.
Unknown Male16:33
Okay so that is C1 should hit your inbox in just a second as well.
Jen6:39
Okay. Okay so all right so I'll wait for that one. So those follow up
scheduled notes to go out and then you can ping the Capital Edge guy and
see if he needs to set up a call and work through it. I forwarded you the
series invite for UAT and Hypercare. That Sukai that sets that up. That
Sukai set up. So what I expect on Friday? Oh, the other office hours.
Unknown Male17:20
Yeah, let's set office hours. Let's set that up right now.
Jen7:24
Okay, so for tomorrow Maybe we do two office hours of 45 minutes. Because
what I would want is coming into this meeting on the. For this Wednesday,
this Friday the 13th hypercare mos. I'd like to show the dashboard. So if
Capital Edge team can get this done or at least have something, we would
want to show it there. But to get that source data we would need our info
for all these 82 apps. So I'd like to at least do that tomorrow.
Unknown Male18:11
Okay, let's go two to 245. Five eastern.
Jen8:17
Okay, do. Yeah, yeah.
Unknown Male18:26
Okay. And then for the second one.
Unknown Other8:37
Do.
Unknown Male18:37
You think before or after? What's your calendar like tomorrow?
Jen8:41
Insane. Yeah, I don't have time really on anything. Let's see, 2 to 2:45.
But then I have. That's really all I have. I should do. Okay, that's the HR
stuff. Hopefully if that gets done a bit early. What is this? Forward this
to you.
Unknown Male19:38
Yeah, I saw that for Friday.
Jen9:42
Sorry.
Unknown Male19:45
Or Sorry, go ahead. Hyper Care on Friday.
Unknown Other10:06
It'S.
Unknown Male112:27
Sorry, my team's melted down there. Yeah. So the Hypercare bit, I just saw
the one that you forwarded. What's the context there? There's one for
Friday too.
Jen12:41
Correct. So the Friday one is a series, weekly series. That's the Sukai and
Jeff that you're on once, not last week, but I forwarded you that series.
The call tomorrow is to showcase to Jeff the Hypercare approach. So there's
a standing meeting on Friday to talk of everything, UAT, etc. And I would.
That's the one I said I'd like to show the dashboard to him because he said
roll the marbles a couple of weeks ago. So we need to show him something.
This one, the Thursday one is we're developing just a few slides on
Hypercare and we want to talk through how Hypercare will work after UAT and
go live. So you can think, you can imagine like all the IT apps. These
apps. So think of it this way. All these systems are getting cut over.
They'll have some issues and there'll be some it. Hypercare needed HR is
changing. So there'll be some HR issues and some HR Hypercare there. The
other stuff for this finance end to end process. If they run into some
process issues, there'll be some hypercare there and there may be different
channels. Then there's an overall broader and those process things have to
do with the legal entity changes. And then you've got another layer of
hypercare that's got to do with the as part of the LE changes, you know,
these purchase orders, sales orders, etc. That will need to be cut over. So
different layers or different contexts or I should say not necessarily
components but different. Maybe components is the right word. Different
scope of hypercare for different teams. It's trying to put together what
the overall holistic approach would be.
Unknown Male114:35
Okay.
Jen14:36
And sharing something with him, as he likes to call it, roll the marbles
with some use cases on what happens if it calls into help desk, what
happens if HR calls into a payroll issue or what happens if a customer
calls in and says I can't raise an invoice for you. So you know, very
different scenarios, very different use cases and very different ways to
treat it and resolve it and triage it. So we want to give him a view of how
that's all going to start looking like.
Unknown Male115:09
Okay. And that's from Jen G.S.
Jen15:13
That'S from Jen. Cool.
Unknown Male115:17
Is there any input needed from.
Jen15:20
Is there.
Unknown Male115:20
Do they have slides? Do they have a deck?
Jen15:22
Yeah, they do and I need to create some slides but give me a second. Yeah,
I will send you some slide if you have so is all the hyper K. Sorry, go
ahead. I will send you the slide shortly. Pre needs to send me the slide
but even outside the what the slide deck they have. Let's look at our all
the hypercare information and see if we have use cases for how we deal in
triage with issues. So like what happens if there is an HR call or what
happens if there is an IT that comes into the Hypercare or the command
center or not Command center Hypercare. So if you have a view.
Unknown Male116:34
Or.
Jen16:35
Rather if you can start creating some flows not from scratch, I'd like us
to leverage things that we already have. So take a look at what we have for
Hypercare in all the reference folders or in your emails that we sent on
hypercare and see if we have any views that talk about how that can work.
There may be one or two canned slides on Hypercare approach. We need to
maybe make it honeywellize it but look at some of the reference material as
well as some of the emails I'd sent prior on the decks on Hypercare
approach.
Unknown Male117:15
Okay.
Jen17:17
And we're just trying to develop a couple of slides that show the use
cases. So you can think of it like a hub and spoke model for the overall.
Different requests come in and different channels. Someone calls in,
someone email, someone calls help desk, someone raises a servicenow ticket.
Not necessarily the process of it, but you know, for the use case. Like,
okay, if I have an IT application issue, how do I get it resolved? Or some
other issue, how do I get it resolved? So I'm just looking for those slides
if there is something there that shows that flow.
Unknown Male117:54
Okay. Yeah, let me see what I can dig up. I'm sure that we have a good
starting point.
Jen17:59
Okay, so that's immediate action with everything else that you've set up.
And I don't have your Friday invites or your Thursday invites. Did you
include me to your, your, your office hours?
Unknown Male118:17
My office hours. One is still open and office hours. We were going to do
two tomorrow at. That's, I think when our call ended. We were going to do
two tomorrow. One from 2 to 2:45 and then the second one. You were saying
morning. Yeah.
Jen18:37
At 10 to. At 10 to 10:45 tomorrow, the 12th. Yes. Okay, so I see that
you've accepted the invites. Okay, so those will. The follow up calls.
Yeah, on. Did you send out the follow up calls?
Unknown Male119:01
Yes.
Jen19:02
Okay. Why do I not have those?
Unknown Male119:05
Oh, I guess. Yeah. Because you weren't in this invite list. Let me add you
to these followers. There's it Finance and then Wednesday.
Jen19:30
I think it's Thursday. We said Thursday. Thursday 10am or 11am we would do.
Unknown Male119:42
ISE.
Jen19:44
ISE actually you may be able to. Yeah, let's do this.
Unknown Male119:50
I haven't slotted for Wednesday at 10:00am.
Jen19:53
No, no, Wednesday is none of those. No, Wednesday won't work. Do it
Thursday. Everybody has another meeting. The OPS up meeting. Or do it for
1030 because they do have another call at that time. So Thursday 10:30
Eastern for supply chain, 19th and then Tuesday 11 for finance. Or if you
want to flip. Well, yeah, never mind, do it. Yeah, our Tuesdays for
finance, 11 Eastern.
Unknown Male120:46
I think Tuesday for Finance is good because there are.
Jen20:52
Yeah, okay.
Unknown Male120:55
Yeah, Tuesday for Finance is good. Then Thursday for ISC is good.
Jen21:01
Okay.
Unknown Male121:04
And then tomorrow from 2 to 2:45.
Jen21:11
For.
Unknown Male121:16
Let me go, we said.
Unknown Other22:10
It.
Jen22:49
So for tomorrow I would do 10 to 1045 of finance and 2 to 245 for ERP.
Unknown Male123:08
Finance 10. Okay, we do that one too. So ERP or ISC IC. Yeah, sorry.
Jen23:31
And then there was a third one which we needed for all the others. We have
to find a way to do that as well. Maybe that can be on Friday.
Unknown Male123:49
Okay, do that. So we want to Tomorrow is.
Unknown Other24:31
So.
Unknown Male124:32
For fun is we want Harry. Do we want to include SRI for erp?
Jen24:40
Yeah. So Shrinivas certainly for the. So it'd be Harry. So Harry and all
those people to the right of Harry in that other roles and responsibilities
list the people he suggested and then also Shrinivas for the finance piece.
Unknown Male125:24
And then Harry and all of those other folks from the roster.
Jen25:28
Finance from the finance roster. And then again Shivas on the ERP side.
Unknown Male125:43
And then what about Bill who was the ERP pm.
Jen25:57
Yeah, for the ER for the supply chain. So Srinivas can answer the stuff
because Bill's in a call. Srinivas Bill are all in a call at 10 in the
morning. So it's just peeling one of them off to sit in on the finance side=
.
Unknown Male126:11
Okay.
Jen26:12
And then, and then at 2 certainly for supply chain it would be Shrinivas.
Oh never mind, never mind, never mind. We may want supply. Okay, sorry for
you may have to flip it. 10 is Gokul in supply chain because I think he's
in India. So invite Gokul and promode to the 10 o' clock office hours on
supply chain and everybody else to the right of promote. If he had somebody
else.
Unknown Male127:06
Let's see who he had she on here. Promote.
Jen27:49
Promote. Isn't the supply chain one Promote Patel?
Unknown Male127:55
Oh I see him. Yeah, it's Silpa Patnik.
Jen27:59
Okay. They may all be in India. So.
Unknown Male128:16
Do you know Jerry Sanderson? Yeah, Rob Delaney. This is separate. Rob
Delaney emailed me and said he should be on the follow ups.
Jen28:27
Okay. So he should be. If not he can forward it. So this is a challenges.
Okay, so there was a lot of people it was forwarded to and let me see who.
Okay.
Unknown Male128:44
Oh he just forwarded it.
Jen28:46
Okay, that's good.
Unknown Male128:48
Okay, let me get back to this. So 10 I see we have Goku promote. Okay, for
ISC. Which one of these do we want to include the ERP folks in the ISC One.
Okay.
Jen29:33
Shrinivas is an ERP guy but we're including him in both. But the other guys
like Bill and Sri, Sri P and Srinivas include him in the supply chain.
Actually just Bill and Srinivas I think is good for the supply chain
officers.
Unknown Male130:11
Okay, perfect. I was just looking through the roster quick to see if
there's anyone that I also Need. Yeah, there's a number of folks. So to the
right of promote. There's a number of folks I'm going to include.
Jen30:48
Yeah, those are usually the service owners or they'll all be IT people.
Unknown Male131:02
So.
Unknown Other31:17
It.
Unknown Male131:45
Okay, so that's the UAT one Gokul Pramod. All the people to the right of
Pramod Sriram.
Jen32:01
No, not Sriram. Sriram is business Shrinivas.
Unknown Male132:07
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Shiv Bill and promotes folks. Cool. And then for
finance it's gonna be.
Jen32:31
Mary and his people in the right.
Unknown Male132:33
Yeah. Also Trinibos and.
Jen32:38
Yeah.
Unknown Male133:00
Sweet.
Unknown Other33:51
It.
Unknown Male134:26
Okay. And then the third one for Friday was. It was like CCEX folks.
There's like the business adjacent and one or two BRV apps.
Jen34:54
Okay, let's think through that. We need to see how best to do that. Maybe
that could be for Tuesday, Friday at 2:00pm Eastern.
Unknown Male135:17
Sweet. Yeah, we can get that. So validate and identify at the service.
Jen36:41
Yeah, let's, let's talk. Just put placeholder for syncing up whatever it
was. Right. I mean. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So what is it? What is it? Let's,
let's sort out one and you can do. Put the other.
Unknown Male136:52
Yeah, it's validate Honeywell service owners. There's a couple that are
missing.
Jen36:57
Okay.
Unknown Male136:58
Identify Athens service owners for BRV systems.
Jen37:07
Yeah.
Unknown Male137:08
Confirm SA sit UAT dates. So pre populated with all of the ones that we
have from your request for calendars. And then the calls yesterday and
today, overall status and dependencies. And so that's all I had for the
gap. The gaps for the.
Jen37:56
Because this is purely getting the tracker, this is purely getting the
dashboard up and running and getting the info. Yeah, exactly. Okay. And
then we may need to do something for the rest of the CCEX and other things
which is you've got finance, it's. And then we've got the other, other
apps. So we've got to see what to do for those.
Unknown Male138:13
Yeah, BRV adjacent, some of the DNA, the data and integration ones cce.
Jen38:25
All right. Okay. So I have to get on this other LES call right now with
Anish.
Unknown Male138:32
Okay. After that can we just chat through the workshop one too?
Jen38:40
Yes, the, the BRB workshop for the 18th. Yeah, the data for the 18th. Yes.
So what you can do in the meantime, if you can open up that deck and take a
look at what it's structured, how it's structured, we'll need to change it.
Everything you see there is an OP model based view that is it for it and
then there's it for business. But we may need to change that a bit because
not everything is a BRV readiness. All of these IT for it ones are for day
one. It's not an 8:1 ask. So we have to think through just how that's
structured and come up with a better way of structuring it and getting that
data. So. Okay, let's talk about it after the end of day call. Actually,
crap. I've got a 5 to 5:30 with Prashant. I need to catch up with him on
all the stuff that he's been missing this day. So can we do it at 5:30
Eastern?
Unknown Male139:32
Yeah, that's perfect.
Jen39:33
Okay, let's do it. All right. Talk in a bit. Yeah, thanks.
Unknown Other39:54
It.

how the dashboard to him because he said roll the marbles a couple of weeks=
 ago. So we need to show him something. This one, the Thursday one is we&#3=
9;re developing just a few slides on Hypercare and we want to talk through =
how Hypercare will work after UAT and go live. So you can think, you can im=
agine like all the IT apps. These apps. So think of it this way. All these =
systems are getting cut over. They&#39;ll have some issues and there&#39;ll=
 be some it. Hypercare needed HR is changing. So there&#39;ll be some HR is=
sues and some HR Hypercare there. The other stuff for this finance end to e=
nd process. If they run into some process issues, there&#39;ll be some hype=
rcare there and there may be different channels. Then there&#39;s an overal=
l broader and those process things have to do with the legal entity changes=
. And then you&#39;ve got another layer of hypercare that&#39;s got to do w=
ith the as part of the LE changes, you know, these purchase orders, sales o=
rders, etc. That will need to be cut over. So different layers or different=
 contexts or I should say not necessarily components but different. Maybe c=
omponents is the right word. Different scope of hypercare for different tea=
ms. It&#39;s trying to put together what the overall holistic approach woul=
d be.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;background-c=
