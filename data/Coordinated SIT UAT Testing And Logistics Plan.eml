---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Scheduling & Coordination of SIT and UAT Testing

#### a. Meeting Structure for SIT (System Integration Testing)
- Two key meetings to be set up per day during the two-week SIT window: =20
  - **Scrum Call (7:45=E2=80=938:00am Eastern):** Review daily plan, assign=
 tasks, discuss priorities, and set alignment for testing. Bill highlighted=
 as a key lead for these sessions.
  - **Daily Wrap-Up Call =
(4:30=E2=80=935:00pm Eastern):** Review completed items versus plan, defect=
 review (pass/fail rates), gap analysis (risk/delay), and process for =
real-time updates to trackers.
- **Audience:** Core team (nine people), =
including Honeywell & Athens IT leads, and key workstream leads.
- **Time Zone Accommodations:** =20
  - APAC team is not expected to attend=
 nighttime wrap-up calls; must pass results to Shrier/Bill before going =
offline.
  - Bill (and similarly situated leads) not expected at pre-dawn =
calls but must ensure communication with their teams via Pierce or setup =
alternate connects.

#### b. Meeting Structure for UAT (User Acceptance =
Testing)
- **Scrum and Wrap-Up Calls:** Similar two-call structure with =
focus adjusted for UAT activities.
  - Inclusion of UAT functional =
coordinators and relevant testers (column-based invitation logic =
clarified=E2=80=94see section on roster and invites below).
- **Agenda Items:**=20
  - Daily: Defects, plans, status against plan, and =
next-day preparation (specific callout to review which function/business =
unit testers are needed in advance).
  - UAT Coordinators responsible for =
proactive communication to day-before testers.

#### c. In-Person vs Remote=
 Weeks
- **Mixed Format:** Second half of SIT/UAT includes a mix of remote =
and in-person participation.

### 2. Roles, Rosters, and Communication Structure

- **Core Attendee Identification:** Mapped out via a spreadsheet =E2=80=93 =
roles include various levels: system leads, workstream leads, UAT =
coordinators, and functional testers.
- **Communication Plan:** =20
  - Over-communication preferred; invitation and CC policies discussed =
(testers as =E2=80=9Cinput points=E2=80=9D for leads who do the actual =
status reporting).
  - Functions with delegated leads (e.g., Finance): =
delegates will provide status in calls, with coordinator overseeing roll-up=
.
  - Special attention to functions/teams with prior communication gaps =
regarding test participation.
- **Supporting Documentation:** =20
  - Roster Excel document (with UAT test case folder reference) provides =
core contact/data structure.
  - Vicki to supply summarized version/lists, =
and email addresses to be compiled and distributed.

---

### 3. UAT, SIT Logistics, and Preparation

#### a. Testing Schedules and =
Assignment
- **Daily Schedules:** Final hourly schedule to be released =
Monday.
- **Tester Assignment:** =20
  - Proactive identification and =
notification of next-day testers considered critical.
  - Mandate for function leads to communicate requirements to their testers=
 at least one day in advance; escalation procedures for unaddressed gaps.

#### b. Reporting, Defect Tracking, and Executive Summaries
- **Tracker Updates:** =20
  - Live status entry by testers throughout the =
day (target: all data updated by 4:00pm prior to 4:30 wrap-up).
- **Reporting Structure:** =20
  - Plan to create standardized =
templates:=20
    - Executive summary/front end
    - Main =
reporting/dashboard

  - Food for thought on consolidation of =
semi-automated and manual tracking and how to clearly present this to =
senior/executive audiences.
- **Follow-up with Reporting Leads:** Meeting =
with Shrinivas and Bill set for discussion on definitions/process for =
=E2=80=9Csemi-automated=E2=80=9D and other reporting nuances, pre-Monday.

#### c. Onsite Logistics (for In-Person Week)
- Pierce responsible for =
finalizing logistics
  - **Food:** Confirmation of headcount (proposed: =
plan for 50 to account for anticipated + unconfirmed participants), =
checking dietary restrictions (allergies, vegan/vegetarian, religious =
restrictions), communication with Tricia (food coordinator)

in-person resources; two week lead time required for arrangements.
  - **Room and Technology:** All participants presumed to have required =
device access; confirm with Pierce if any exceptions or issues arise (e.g.,=
 chargers, access/facilities).
  - **Team Building:** Proposals for dinner =
or team activity (intro dinner on arrival Sunday; possible dinner Thursday =
to avoid travel disruptions), pending Paul=E2=80=99s approval on budget, =
handled by Jessica.

Transcript:
0:00
Yes, no worries. So for the two weeks of sit, I'm going to set up a scrum =
call and I'm going to set up a daily wrap up call. The audience for both =
calls same. It's going to be the core team from this week. The meeting with=
 like the nine of us, not just the four but R9 and columns H and I from the=
 spreadsheet.

0:31
Honeywell work stream lead. Honeywell IT lead. Yes.

0:35
And so my only other call out and Athens.

0:38
Athens IT lead.

0:40
Oh, so I need. Hold on. I, I partially said that wrong. I identified H and =
I which are Honeywell IT lead and Athens it leads. Do I need Honeywell work=
 streaming as well? So yes, do I need gh? Got it. Okay. So the only other =
call out is time zones. I'm going to put a caveat note in there that says =
for the nighttime call APAC team is not expected to be on but they are =
expected to pass the results onto Shrier, Bill Srinivasa Bill. I mean =
before they get offline, make sure you're connecting with them so they have=
 your results. And then for the scrum call, I'm specifically calling out =
Bill for this one because Bill is one of our true leads. I'm just gonna =
note to tell Bill if you're not going to adjust your hours, which is fine. =
I'm not expecting him to. But I am expecting that you be on at least the =
daily wrap up so that way we can make sure we're aligned. Pierce can =
communicate out to the team in the morning or if there's any questions in =
the morning what Bill's team is going to be testing on. And Bill can set up=
 a connect with them if he needs to. That's more in his time zone. So =
meaning we're going to set up a 7:45 call. I'm not expecting Bill to be on =
a call at 4:45 at the time. But if there is any connection point that he =
needs to have with his team then he's going to need to either set something=
 up or just make sure Pierce is informed. Let's say Monday night for what =
Tuesday morning's activities are to review that with the team on the scrum.=
 So I think that covers it. So my intention there is just identifying and =
acknowledging the fact that this is outside of your. This is an off hour =
for you. I know some people it's going to maybe be off like it's later in =
the afternoon but I'm talking like APAC 4pm calls 4am I don't expect it to =
be on so. Yeah, just aligning on that case. That's a good way to say it.

2:51
Okay. Yeah.

2:54
Okay. I was gonna go to GAT for a second unless you =
had a question about the.

2:57
No, no, no. Just thinking through. Thinking=
 through that. Yeah. That's. We have to level set that expectations. To =
your point. I'm just concerned. I just. To Paul, to Jeff's point, I think =
it's almost like we need to do a dry run of this and just see how it works =
over the next few days and work out the kinks.

3:16
Yes.

3:16
Because it's going to be mess Wednesday, I think. And then.

3:20
Yes. So here's the deal. We had talked about not setting up the screen =
until Wednesday.

3:26
Okay.

3:27
I think that we set it up for Tuesday. I=
 don't want to put it. I don't want to put a meeting on the calendar right =
now for 7:45 on Monday without giving people notice.

3:35
Yeah. Without people. Yes.

3:36
Yes.

3:37
Let's start Tuesday and then =
prepare everything Monday.

3:40
Yes. Because my other concern is Bill and =
Trini Mountain. Part of the reason I didn't invite them to this is I know =
they're working on stuff but they both are very good technically aligned. =
They have good organization. But they're so focused on.

3:54
It's tearing the weeds.

3:56
Yeah. They're component that I wanted to. We =
need more of the high level right now and just the people side of this =
deployment which has not really had so much thought. So that's why we have =
this. So second half is from calls. So we are going to have half of that be=
 remote and half of that be in person. But I still want to have it set up =
because we're going to have some folks not there. So for the UAT scrum =
calls, it's going to be R14. My first question is do I invite the people in=
 columns G H and I to the UAT ones? And I think the answer is yes, but I =
just want to get your validation.

4:37
Probably the Athens lead and the =
Honeywell.

4:41
It leads but not necessarily the Honeywell work stream.

4:45
In many places they're the same but I mean they're not that many more.=
 But probably just the. So if you unfilter.

4:56
You know what? I'll =
unfilter, but sure.

4:58
There's not many.

4:59
Yeah.

5:00
Just clear filter and then data.

5:04
Back to Vicki's main point is I'd =
rather over communicate than not if we have. Yeah. So here's the back half =
of this that I just want to make sure we're especially aligned on. We have.=
 Okay. Columns N, columns O. I Think if we invite everybody in O, it's =
going to be a cluster. My thought is that we invite people in nature and we=
 make it very clear that the people in N need to review whatever we talk =
about with the people in O.

5:48
Yes.

5:49
Okay.

5:50
They are the ones because in technically they. And probably we need to =
invite the. For uat, the UAT coordinators. So that's one level above these =
function leads. So Sriram for all of supply chain or peers for all of =
commercial or whoever it is for the other functions. Will J or you know, =
his counterpart for well, Will J for all of.

6:17
Yeah, can we finance. We=
 have the roster. Screenshot of that list again.

6:21
Yeah, here, I'll send you a link to the roster.

6:24
Okay. Rakesh. And send it to me once before. But guys.

6:28
Yeah, it's in your UAT folder. It's just, it's an Excel roster in the uat. =
UAT test case folder.

6:35
Yeah. I also talked to Matt Teigen and I was =
like, hey, Matt, are you interested in coming to these? He goes, no, =
Jessica. He's like, just put Sandra on. And I was like, okay, I knew he was=
 gonna say that because. And it should be Sandra. So. Yeah, I just, I =
thought it was funny. He's like, I, I, he's already like triple booked most=
 days that like whenever him and I would have connects, he would 90% of the=
 time need to cancel them. So I was like, all right, this is, this is not =
going to be him. But okay, so I will invite them as well and I'm going to =
set it up for same expectations of, you know, if this is outside of your, =
like the morning one. If you are. And I might just call it out and say, hey=
, if you're west coast time zone, we know this is outside of your normal =
working hours. You know, please just make sure that you have somebody on =
this call, you know, as a representative with your information. And I'll =
probably just need to call that out as like, please make sure you give to =
Pierce. Vicki, can we CC those additional. Yes, Vicki. The answer to your =
questions? Yes.

7:37
I mean, we could put them in a table. Like we have =
them by system. You could say like these are the expected. You could call =
them like status, input, point of contact, and then the folks above them. =
Right. Like the, if I understand what you're saying, you're saying that the=
 testers from that UAT tester column where we have a ton of names, they =
would be listed as the input for the status reporting for the people that =
are expected to join the call. And you make that linkage clear and then you=
 can go up to the workstream lead and then up to the UAT coordinator.

8:14
So for finance to the point you're making, Vicky is Will has delegated it =
to four or five people as points of contact. So those four or five within =
his function finance areas will represent him. So those would get invited =
as providing the readout. As a coordinator, they're supposed to read out =
status on their function.

8:39
Yeah. But yeah, to Vicki's point, she's =
also thinking about the email. So yeah, we should definitely see them in =
the. The other thing I want to make sure we are aligned is for the agenda =
for the UAT calls because we're going to start getting more people on these=
 calls. What I'd like to do, and I think the answer is this comes from Bill=
 and Srinivas, but I want to make sure that I reviewed this. Vicki and her =
and I are lying but Mac and Rakesh kind of level set me here. We already =
know there's a concern with some of these folks and either not wanting to =
test or somebody got identified and it hasn't been communicated to them. =
Because my expectation would be that these UAT functional leads have had =
some kind of comms with their team. But we know that hasn't happened with =
which is why we're getting myself and Vicki involved to send direct comms =
to everyone. So we're sending this out now. We're doing the kickoff call. =
But what I think is another level of coordination we should do is during =
the scrum call we have a very clear agenda we're reviewing. We can figure =
out the logistics. Not the logistics, but the details of the agenda. But =
essentially we're going to review number of defects, we're going to review =
the plan for the day. But one of the other aspects I want to review is =
preparing for the next day.

10:14
Yes, yes.

10:15
And I want to do that during the scrum call, not the wrap up. Only because =
if I'm finance lead and Vicki is one of my testers and it's Monday and =
she's supposed to test on Tuesday, I want to make sure that we tell Jessica=
 that, hey Jessica, we're going to run finance scripts 1, 2, 3, 4. I =
Jessica, then go into whatever files I need to say, hey, I need Vicki, I =
need Matt, I need Rakesh. And the expectation is that they connect with =
their people the day before and say, hey, as a reminder, you're going to be=
 involved in testing tomorrow, folks. Testing all week. It's not really a =
big issue. I'm thinking more like the Tax people that are fighting back and=
 forth on who it should be that we need for probably 10 minutes of their =
time. So I want to make sure as part of our agenda for the UAT calls, that =
we review what business unit or business UAT testers are needed and the =
functional leads are responsible for connecting with them the day before =
their tests.

11:16
Okay, I follow you. I think we just need to lay that =
out in that agenda very clearly and talk through that on the first few =
calls.

11:28
Okay. So if we, I think we have enough time to do this real =
quick for the scrum calls for sit, it's going to be reviewing the daily =
plan for the morning call. Other than reviewing the daily plan, I don't =
really know that we need to review anything else. Again, sit because if =
there's any defects or any defect tracking, they'll tell us about defects =
end of day, but when they start working on them, they'll be part of their =
plan. So I think the SCRUM for SIT can just be focused on here is our plan =
that makes sense.

12:13
I follow you. Yep.

12:15
Okay. And again, to your=
 point, as we hash out the details, you may say, hey, we also need to =
review X, Y or Z. But I want to create the agenda in there now to start =
getting people, you know, level set and we can always add things. So during=
 the wrap up, it's going to be review what's completed, review any defects.=
 Anything else for the wrap up that we should explicitly call out. Because =
if they give us what's complete, completed to versus plan, I'm going to =
call that out because if they just tell us we completed 10 and we forgot =
they're supposed to complete 13, that's we'll want to know that. So yeah, =
yeah. So what's completed versus what was the, the plan, the mitigation. If=
 there's a gap, meaning the whole idea of if it's a risk versus a delay and=
 then review of the defects. Now the defect component of that may =
transition a little as we work through some of the defect tracking. But I =
think for now I can just say review defects, slash meaning pass fail.

13:31
Which means we need to get all these trackers in play because people =
either go in and update that or they tell us that and we live edit because =
we need to get the result out right after that.

13:43
I think that we ask them to and maybe that's a call up item for the morning=
 call is we remind them live update the file. So when we're doing the wrap =
up, we're not having to do live edits. We have it Up. Oh, I think he just =
came right back.

14:21
Sorry, I'm back.

14:22
No worries.

14:26
Yeah. So you were saying we have them provide the write up during that end =
of day or do we want them to go in and provide it and update it and then =
report on it?

14:38
I think that they just report on it during wrap up. So=
 I think during our scrum, what the calls that we remind every day, =
everybody every day put in the agenda is adding the details to the tracker =
live through the day.

14:55
Okay.

14:56
And then theoretically when we =
all connect at the end of day, I think we have the file open in case we =
need to make live changes or updates. But I don't want to be sitting there =
entering in, oh, Shreenivas tested 10 and Bill tested two. I'd rather that =
be in there because I'm trying to keep this call to as short as possible =
and I'd rather they have it in there and we're reviewing it.

15:20
Yeah, yeah, we should set that, that, that cadence then that, you know, if =
the call is at 5 Eastern then that by 4:30 that people have updated that =
whatever the status is at that point in time. And we come in and they read =
out and say I've tested, I planned seven, I tested six, one's a delay and I=
 got defects in two.

15:42
Okay. So the scrum call I was going to set up =
for 7:45 to 8.

15:51
Okay.

15:52
And then the wrap up because I'm =
thinking we're probably going to need a little more time on the wrap up. We=
 do 30 minutes, we do 4:30 to 5.

16:02
Is that early? Is it? We need to do=
 it a bit later. I like 4:30 to 5 Eastern. Well if it's a point in time. =
Yeah. They probably are going to finish testing. Per your calendar, they're=
 not going till 4pm Right. They test at 3, they're done.

16:26
I think we should keep it at 7:45 because we're still going to have our =
policy. Yeah. And so let's do this Rakesh. Let's put it 4:30 to 5. And if =
we again, this is a little evergreen. If someone says hey, you know what, I=
 really want to be running test till 5, we can move it out because we have =
people in so many different time zones. I don't know how critical it would =
be because like Bill for example, I'm gonna speculate even though I haven't=
 asked it. I don't think he's the type. He's gonna get up at 4am so life =
revolves. Gonna get up at his know 8am which would be 11 our time that by =
the time 4, 4:30 rolls around he may still have like 2, 3 hours of testing.=
 So what we can do as part of our mos we realize like he's going to test =
for two, three hours beyond our time. We can always add that as an agenda =
item for the morning scrum to say, you know, give Bill five minutes for his=
 wrap up notes for whatever he tested beyond our daily wrap up and then =
work through the plan. So let's just tell, tell everyone you know =
expectations that you fill in your edits as much as you can by like 4pm =
Eastern standard. So when we review at 4:30, you know, we have the most =
live information. Don't let it just be sitting on your desktop. And then =
the only difference then for UAT is going to be in the morning. We are =
going to want to review the next day's testers and have the UAT function =
lead function send out palms to the next day testers.

18:24
Yeah, that you're in deck to test this or.

18:26
Yeah, yeah. Because if =
they do that and then someone comes back and says it's not me, that's the =
type of stuff that I'm not physically going to be testing. You're not =
testing. Vicki's not testing. So we hear back, hey, Ben Goldstein has a =
problem with tax. Guess what? Because immediately escalated to 65. =
Immediately escalate to Jeff and then go try to track that person down. So =
it gives us time versus that day. And if we start to realize that we =
actually need two days notice, we can always pull that in a day. I'm a =
little more concerned about the remote week than the in person week because=
 in person week we should have most people in like the same spot but we =
should be good to go from there. One other random question. Sri Bass like =
kind of jokingly said this earlier, but would it be helpful, beneficial if =
I can get Paul to approve like a, either a dinner out one night or like a =
team building activity like nothing.

19:22
That's when they're in person. =
Yeah, yeah, why not? I think absolutely. Maybe there's an intro. If they =
all come in that Friday they, you know, that Sunday they maybe there's an =
intro dinner on something Sunday as well. And then there's a, if they stick=
 around, there's a Friday, you know. Yeah, absolutely. I think the, the =
answer is absolutely.

19:44
All right, let me connect with Paul to see if =
he has the budget and then I can. He gave me the name of his coordinator to=
 work for work through food. So let me just ask him if he has any concern =
with that. And if he does not, then I'll work to get something set up. So =
to your point, maybe it's dinner Sunday night for those that come in. I =
don't know what when people are traveling back out. So I don't know if I'd =
want to wait till Friday, but maybe it's right.

20:10
Maybe a Wednesday or a Thursday thing.

20:12
Yeah, I'm thinking more =
Thursday because if people decide to stay out a little late, it's not going=
 to be too disruptive. Yep. Okay.

20:22
All right. I need to drop for =
another call.

20:26
Call. No, you don't.

20:29
So in terms of the, the =
other additional thing. So I see two things immediately, at least in =
everything you've added. Mac, the list of employees. Paul has sent that to =
me. Mac.

20:43
Yep.

20:44
Yeah. As you share your screen. Oh, Paul has =
sent me the list of employees. It's password protected, so I need to get =
that to you for you to do a lookup so that we understand the Athens testers=
. And then we need to think through the reporting on page nine, how we want=
 to add the dashboard and the reporting. Is there some sort of an executive=
 summary front end? We do in addition to this page, you know, do we add =
three pages, you know, to what we had? If you're sharing. Mac.

21:16
Oh, let me share again.

21:22
So this page, we probably have to have a =
front end or maybe this is it. But yeah, we, I just need to think through =
because I don't think just one. And then obviously there will be a line at =
the bottom for HR because he wants to incorporate that in here. And I think=
 yeah, we can talk through also the defect. So we'll probably send a =
summary defect sheet as well that talks through that. So we need to think =
through how we consolidate the automated, non automated end to end process =
versus functional versus systems reporting that need to think through a bit=
 more of that tomorrow and have something ready by Monday that we can, we =
can share with peers and say this is how we're going to run the Tuesday =
morning scrum. This is how we're going to send out the Tuesday email. =
Evening end of day report using this template in the front page and then a =
third page that has a defect. So just food for thought in terms of just =
standardizing those trackers over the next couple of days. So, so, and then=
 the rest of.

22:25
Sorry about 4. We want to just try to grab 3:30 to 4 =
with Shrinivox and Belle to talk through the reporting a little bit. Not =
that we needed. Okay. I don't, we don't need to finalize it. But I want to =
at least get an idea of what they mean by like semi automated and not.

22:44
Yes, yes.

22:45
Because what I'm thinking is maybe you can work that=
 a little bit, sort of the weekend. And then we have a meeting Monday =
morning. Or you can hash out the remaining details. Okay.

22:53
Okay.

22:55
All right. Go Jumbo. Do your thing if you need to. Mac and Vicki, I =
can stay on. Especially Vicki, if you had things you wanted to talk through=
. And Mac, I do want to start looking slide three real quick.

23:06
Start with what I'm trying to do.

23:08
I want to look at slide three with=
 you real quick.

23:10
I know.

23:11
Professionally. Okay, so here's all =
our immediate tasks that we need to complete. UAT testing method, not add =
testing method. 200 ERP.

23:29
Okay, that's this column. And then whatever=
 we think through with.

23:32
Yeah, yeah.

23:34
UAT test another. So we =
just need. I need to talk to Arpit and have him give me the count. I think =
it's 26 countries that they're testing for HR. And then how many are done? =
How many still need to be done? Etc. Add that to the master tracker and =
then add it as a row in here. Hourly schedule.

23:58
That's on me. I will have that out on Monday.

24:02
Yeah. And then MOs and comms we talked through. You're going to send the =
template to Paul with the instructions of who to send to. Right?

24:12
Vicki is going to do that once I give her the names.

24:15
Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. So I put in the chat, not.

24:21
The names, but the email addresses. I need to just finish pulling them into=
 your file.

24:27
Okay. I also put in the chat a link to. I summarized the=
 roster data with the UAT functional coordinators for all of the functions.=
 So you can pull up to the functional coordinator level for the core team.

24:55
Okay. For hr. All right. I think I'm just gonna invite Matt. I don't.=
 I know that all of them are busy. I was talking with Matt. He said just to=
 invite Sandra, but I think I might just invite him and then put Sandra as.=
 Put Matt as. Option. Whatever. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Let's just stop there.=
 Talking too much. All right, so I really want to copy column F for our UAT=
 coordinators. Right? Yep. Okay. Put on here. We need to finalize the =
logistics or the remote session. And Pierce is going to own this, so I'm =
going to give you the specific things. Finalize food with Trisha. T R I C H=
 I A. Yep. Vicki, I was just mentioned cars. And then in parentheses next =
to it, actually, where it's like, where you have remote session logistics. =
Put Pierce up there because Pierce is going to own this. And then after =
that just say Jessica sent Ko email Friday. No, no, my apologies. Right =
next to the finalized food with Trisha. Just say that Jessica send KO email=
 Friday Pierce to finalize details week of 6 23. Because I'm gonna be out =
and I don't like I would. If I have to get on a call, I'm gonna get on like=
 a phone call with you guys. I'm not gonna coordinate food. Here's to do =
that.

27:12
100.

27:13
Yeah. So where you have the word me, where you =
suggest put in finalize cars details with tree sri. Oh, you can remove. No,=
 no, you can remove my name. This is all. Pierce owns this. And Vicki, =
you're aligned and understand that even though it may have Sree's name on =
here, like Pierce needs to follow up with SRI to make sure that he sent all=
 the stuff in. Yes, perfect. The other thing that we do need to do is have =
a, a connection with Pierce on Monday. Don't put this down. I'm just gonna =
do it right now. So I'm gonna try to set up meetings in the morning. My =
preferences be that I attend all of my meetings in the morning and then I'm=
 trying to be off for the rest of the rest of the day just being on =
vacation. So for you two on the line, if I set up a 7:30 to 8 with Pierce =
as a connect from like a debrief from this week, are you guys able to join?=
 It would basically be right after.

28:37
Yeah, that's fine. I work so I =
live in Denver, but I work east coast hours pretty much. So.

28:45
And Matt, to be honest, if you're not able to join but Rakesh is not a big =
deal. But honestly I think it's really more. I think the critical people =
are gonna be like me, Vicki and Pierce.

28:56
Good.

28:58
So I'm just gonna set it up for 7:30 and and I'm gonna literally call =
debrief to get him up to speed and we'll see what happens. My biggest =
concern is we want him to run the meetings on Tuesday and I will be back up=
 if we need to, but I really want to get him up to speed as early as =
possible. Like, hey, you need to connect out.

29:26
Of there and Rakesh and I can help sort of get him up to speed too. I think=
 that he's good when he has a, like a plan of action and we sort of know =
the roadmap, right. Like what needs to be done. So I think that he will =
respond well enough to being told, hey, you need to go talk to this person =
about this and set up this. And you have done such an excellent job of =
putting that together. I think that we'll be able to. To all collectively =
coach him along to make it happen.

29:59
I appreciate that much. But it's =
funny because he is supposed to be.

30:02
I know. Well, yeah, I know. He's=
 been.

30:05
We can end that. You don't need to elaborate. I get it.

30:08
Yeah.

30:11
No, but I can do that. That's what we're thinking next =
week. That's why these simpler things like the takeoff pole. He can do all =
that. The stuff that we did this week with the schedule. He doesn't really =
need to talk that much to it, per se. I think if there's a question people =
question like why was I identified? Or this, that or the other.

30:31
Yeah, well, we need. We'll just manage him on actions like you need to go =
validate that. I don't know, whatever system needs to be in place to send =
the next day testers the notification of their timing and the tests that =
are required or whatever is in place and that those have been sent by the =
functions or whatever it is. Right. Like we'll get tactical.

30:56
The other thing for Pierce is complete sign S I N E for all remote =
resources. And all these things need to be completed by next week. That way=
, if there's a gap. So the cars is supposed to get sent out today for all =
the people that responded. It takes two weeks for cars to get done. Well, =
they say two weeks, but they're trying to get themselves a little =
permission. So cars need to be put in Monday, sign put in Friday, finalize =
the boosters put in Friday. But the food's not really critical. Cars and =
sign are the most critical of all that. Vicki. Thinking out loud, the bill =
and Srinivas told me there's 32 people coming in for this, but I know =
there's going to be some remote testers in Morris Plains. So I'm thinking =
that we order enough food for 50 people because I know there's. There's =
going to be 32 coming in, but I don't know exactly how many are. Okay, I'm =
gonna put that in my email to. I'm gonna copy all the food stuff because =
it's another one that needs to bear with Pierce. I'm gonna set up a new =
email chain with just. Actually maybe I'll just reply to Trisha and say, =
hey, we have 32 confirmed people coming in. We have two additional =
resources that are going to be in Horse plains. And I'll put that question =
on Pierce. Say Pierce, does it make sense to set it up for 50 people? And =
what also just dawned on me is we may need to ask about food allergies. So =
Matt, can you please add the Pierce list under the food there's a little =
submarine. Reach out to the in person team to see if there's any food =
restrictions. That's a better word to say because some people it's not an =
allergy as much as this may be a personal choice of like I'm vegan =
vegetarian. So we're gonna need that list.

33:08
There's probably gonna be=
 vegetarians if they're coming from India.

33:13
I have the same thought. =
So it's probably most likely going to be a vegetarian situation. Situation.

33:17
Yeah.

33:18
But some people are like, hey, I will eat, I won't eat =
pork, but they'll eat other meat like chicken, beef. So yeah, the irony is =
like I actually have a food allergy that I keep forgetting about because I =
recently found out. But it's not like anaphylaxis. I always forget about it=
. But like I have an allergy to shellfish. Not that you typically get =
shellfish situation. But yeah, it's. It's usually more like the vegetarian =
or pork type situation. You gotta think through cars, time, food. Shri got =
the room. So we talked that through, so we're good. So I think those are =
the only in person logistics. Vicki, we have on here the any technology =
needs. So I don't. Let's talk that out loud, but I don't think so. All the =
people that are going to be testing are going to be doing it with their =
laptops. When it comes to like logins or anything. All these people have =
access to these tools already. So it shouldn't be like a new license or =
anything since you already have it theoretically are doing this right now. =
There's no access concerns like moving things to a new instance and they =
don't have logging criteria and they all should have their own laptops. The=
 only potential technology needs would be if like somebody, let's say =
forgot their charger. But if we all have conventionally the same laptops, I=
 don't think that's a, an issue because they borrow somebody else's. So I =
think we are good. But I think that's a good call out. Maybe review that =
one Vicki, with Pierce. I don't know that we need to add it as an action =
because I can't currently think of anything. Maybe just like ask Pierce =
that question on Monday just in case. Okay, Mac, you're updating the =
presentation. The country level data comment, is that the one? If somebody =
is H.R. honeywell versus Advanced Materials. Sorry, what was. What was =
number two?

35:57
Number two is just I need to add. I need to talk to =
Arpit and Jeff this morning asked for at the country level for HR, how many=
 test scripts are being run? So there's 26 countries that they're testing =
how many have been run and you.

36:13
Mean just putting the ADP stuff in =
here?

36:15
Yeah.

36:16
Okay, sorry. Let's go to the second. Okay.

36:18
I'd have to remind myself to do that or that's an easy. I just have to =
reach out to Arpit and he's out of office and I need to remember to go back=
 to him.

36:27
Got it. Can we do this? Can we consolidate those two and =
just say updates to reporting? Yeah and I'm trying to make sure in my mind =
like have MLS stuff we have to do, we have logistics stuff we have to do. =
Yeah, those are both really like reporting updates. They're important but =
let's consolidate. I'm just trying to make sure we're not missing anything.=
 I orders the final hourly schedule.

36:59
Oh we need. I have to do the =
thing from Rakesh on the. Oh that.

37:11
Yeah.

37:11
Athens test user scope validation and counts.

37:34
Yes. That Audrey never shows up to me. Vicki, out of curiosity, did you =
connect with Pierce at all before he left? Like have you talked with Pierce=
 previously? Vicki? No. Okay. The only reason I'm asking is because we're =
gonna be like two bulls in a china closet when he gets back. He's gonna be =
like who the hell are these two? Okay, so I'm setting up a couple call for =
just out of curiosity, would it be better if I took a call for 3:00 clock =
Eastern so 10 minutes from now or 3:30 to just have a quick conversation =
with Trini boss and Bill regarding the recording.

39:08
3:30. I really need to eat something.

39:11
Totally fine. I'm asking. I =
have a meeting at 4 which is I can't do it. Anything. Okay Vicki, if you =
can't get on, that's totally fine. I want to just get some thoughts on =
paper between you boss and Bill about Jeff's ask for that whole automated =
versus manual and then have you and Mac, you and Rakesh sort of remaining =
hours tonight, slash through the weekend, maybe do some updates and review =
this on 9am on Monday. Vicki, give us one second because there's one more =
thing I need Matt to add to this. Matt, can you just add where you see SIP =
scrum calls underneath? Can you put in copy for UAT scrum calls or =
something. So you have the SIT ones. I got to do the UAT ones too.

40:13
Can I just add it up here? Like SIT and UAT scrum calls?

40:17
Yeah, sure. There's, there's nuanced differences, but I have them in my =
notes. So for the purpose of this, it's totally fine. Okay, so I think we =
have everything. The three actions that I have out of this are, oh, and I =
need to set up the take off call F4 under MoS and Comms. We need another =
one. Just say Jessica to send out kickoff call and Vicki to review material=
 for peers to present on Monday. I'll likely be on that call too, Vicki, =
but I just want to make sure we note it on here like I'm setting it up. =
Vicki, you've done a good job of like we're 80, 85% there with the content,=
 but we need to review that with Pearson on Monday and then he's going to =
do the actual presentation. So the four things that I owe is, Vicki, the =
email addresses, which is the first thing I'm going to do as soon as we get=
 off the call, I need to finish the schedule. I need to set up the SIT and =
the UAT calls and then set up the kickoff call. But actually I'm going to =
put the schedule last because I can do that over the weekend. I want to =
make sure we get these calls set up before end of day. All right, Mac, if =
you can email that out to all of us, I think that's a good one to send. And=
 then Vicki, I see that you have this up here. Do you want us to take one =
last read of it or did you have a question? I think we're good then. So =
let's all just. Oh, Mac, you can jump and Vicki and I can just chat real =
quick. I think she wants to show us something on the the comms and then we =
connect at 3:30.

42:17
Okay, sweet. I'll send this to you in email, paste =
it in the chat right now, real quick, and then we'll talk in a little bit =
here. Thank you so much.

42:26
Sounds good. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

time zones. I&#x27;m going to put a caveat note in there that says for the =
nighttime call APAC team is not expected to be on but they are expected to =
pass the results onto Shrier, Bill Srinivasa Bill. I mean before they get =
offline, make sure you&#x27;re connecting with them so they have your =
results. And then for the scrum call, I&#x27;m specifically calling out =
Bill for this one because Bill is one of our true leads. I&#x27;m just =
gonna note to tell Bill if you&#x27;re not going to adjust your hours, =
which is fine. I&#x27;m not expecting him to. But I am expecting that you =
be on at least the daily wrap up so that way we can make sure we&#x27;re =
aligned. Pierce can communicate out to the team in the morning or if =
there&#x27;s any questions in the morning what Bill&#x27;s team is going to=
 be testing on. And Bill can set up a connect with them if he needs to. =
That&#x27;s more in his time zone. So meaning we&#x27;re going to set up a =
7:45 call. I&#x27;m not expecting Bill to be on a call at 4:45 at the time.=
 But if there is any connection point that he needs to have with his team =
then he&#x27;s going to need to either set something up or just make sure =
Pierce is informed. Let&#x27;s say Monday night for what Tuesday =
morning&#x27;s activities are to review that with the team on the scrum. So=
 I think that covers it. So my intention there is just identifying and =
acknowledging the fact that this is outside of your. This is an off hour =
for you. I know some people it&#x27;s going to maybe be off like it&#x27;s =
later in the afternoon but I&#x27;m talking like APAC 4pm calls 4am I =
don&#x27;t expect it to be on so. Yeah, just aligning on that case. =

send direct comms to everyone. So we&#x27;re sending this out now. =
We&#x27;re doing the kickoff call. But what I think is another level of =
coordination we should do is during the scrum call we have a very clear =
agenda we&#x27;re reviewing. We can figure out the logistics. Not the =
logistics, but the details of the agenda. But essentially we&#x27;re going =
to review number of defects, we&#x27;re going to review the plan for the =
day. But one of the other aspects I want to review is preparing for the =
next day.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgrou=

Jessica that, hey Jessica, we&#x27;re going to run finance scripts 1, 2, 3,=
 4. I Jessica, then go into whatever files I need to say, hey, I need Vicki=

 their people the day before and say, hey, as a reminder, you&#x27;re going=
 to be involved in testing tomorrow, folks. Testing all week. It&#x27;s not=
 really a big issue. I&#x27;m thinking more like the Tax people that are =
fighting back and forth on who it should be that we need for probably 10 =
minutes of their time. So I want to make sure as part of our agenda for the=
 UAT calls, that we review what business unit or business UAT testers are =
needed and the functional leads are responsible for connecting with them =
the day before their tests.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;pad=

there&#x27;s any defects or any defect tracking, they&#x27;ll tell us about=
 defects end of day, but when they start working on them, they&#x27;ll be =

your point, as we hash out the details, you may say, hey, we also need to =
review X, Y or Z. But I want to create the agenda in there now to start =
getting people, you know, level set and we can always add things. So during=
 the wrap up, it&#x27;s going to be review what&#x27;s completed, review =
any defects. Anything else for the wrap up that we should explicitly call =
out. Because if they give us what&#x27;s complete, completed to versus plan=
, I&#x27;m going to call that out because if they just tell us we completed=
 10 and we forgot they&#x27;re supposed to complete 13, that&#x27;s =
we&#x27;ll want to know that. So yeah, yeah. So what&#x27;s completed =
versus what was the, the plan, the mitigation. If there&#x27;s a gap, =
meaning the whole idea of if it&#x27;s a risk versus a delay and then =
review of the defects. Now the defect component of that may transition a =
little as we work through some of the defect tracking. But I think for now =
I can just say review defects, slash meaning pass fail.</div></div><div =

have our policy. Yeah. And so let&#x27;s do this Rakesh. Let&#x27;s put it =
4:30 to 5. And if we again, this is a little evergreen. If someone says hey=
, you know what, I really want to be running test till 5, we can move it =
out because we have people in so many different time zones. I don&#x27;t =
know how critical it would be because like Bill for example, I&#x27;m gonna=
 speculate even though I haven&#x27;t asked it. I don&#x27;t think =
he&#x27;s the type. He&#x27;s gonna get up at 4am so life revolves. Gonna =
get up at his know 8am which would be 11 our time that by the time 4, 4:30 =
rolls around he may still have like 2, 3 hours of testing. So what we can =
do as part of our mos we realize like he&#x27;s going to test for two, =
three hours beyond our time. We can always add that as an agenda item for =
the morning scrum to say, you know, give Bill five minutes for his wrap up =
notes for whatever he tested beyond our daily wrap up and then work through=
 the plan. So let&#x27;s just tell, tell everyone you know expectations =
that you fill in your edits as much as you can by like 4pm Eastern standard=
. So when we review at 4:30, you know, we have the most live information. =
Don&#x27;t let it just be sitting on your desktop. And then the only =
difference then for UAT is going to be in the morning. We are going to want=
 to review the next day&#x27;s testers and have the UAT function lead =
function send out palms to the next day testers.</div></div><div =

testing. So we hear back, hey, Ben Goldstein has a problem with tax. Guess =
what? Because immediately escalated to 65. Immediately escalate to Jeff and=
 then go try to track that person down. So it gives us time versus that day=
. And if we start to realize that we actually need two days notice, we can =
always pull that in a day. I&#x27;m a little more concerned about the =
remote week than the in person week because in person week we should have =
most people in like the same spot but we should be good to go from there. =

talks through that. So we need to think through how we consolidate the =
automated, non automated end to end process versus functional versus =
systems reporting that need to think through a bit more of that tomorrow =
and have something ready by Monday that we can, we can share with peers and=
 say this is how we&#x27;re going to run the Tuesday morning scrum. This is=
 how we&#x27;re going to send out the Tuesday email. Evening end of day =

 a defect. So just food for thought in terms of just standardizing those =

So the cars is supposed to get sent out today for all the people that =
responded. It takes two weeks for cars to get done. Well, they say two =
weeks, but they&#x27;re trying to get themselves a little permission. So =
cars need to be put in Monday, sign put in Friday, finalize the boosters =
put in Friday. But the food&#x27;s not really critical. Cars and sign are =
the most critical of all that. Vicki. Thinking out loud, the bill and =
Srinivas told me there&#x27;s 32 people coming in for this, but I know =
there&#x27;s going to be some remote testers in Morris Plains. So I&#x27;m =
thinking that we order enough food for 50 people because I know =
there&#x27;s. There&#x27;s going to be 32 coming in, but I don&#x27;t know =
exactly how many are. Okay, I&#x27;m gonna put that in my email to. =
I&#x27;m gonna copy all the food stuff because it&#x27;s another one that =
needs to bear with Pierce. I&#x27;m gonna set up a new email chain with =
just. Actually maybe I&#x27;ll just reply to Trisha and say, hey, we have =
32 confirmed people coming in. We have two additional resources that are =
going to be in Horse plains. And I&#x27;ll put that question on Pierce. Say=
 Pierce, does it make sense to set it up for 50 people? And what also just =
dawned on me is we may need to ask about food allergies. So Matt, can you =
please add the Pierce list under the food there&#x27;s a little submarine. =
Reach out to the in person team to see if there&#x27;s any food =
restrictions. That&#x27;s a better word to say because some people =
it&#x27;s not an allergy as much as this may be a personal choice of like =
I&#x27;m vegan vegetarian. So we&#x27;re gonna need that list.=

it&#x27;s not like anaphylaxis. I always forget about it. But like I have =
an allergy to shellfish. Not that you typically get shellfish situation. =
But yeah, it&#x27;s. It&#x27;s usually more like the vegetarian or pork =

only in person logistics. Vicki, we have on here the any technology needs. =
So I don&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s talk that out loud, but I don&#x27;t think so. =
All the people that are going to be testing are going to be doing it with =
their laptops. When it comes to like logins or anything. All these people =
have access to these tools already. So it shouldn&#x27;t be like a new =
license or anything since you already have it theoretically are doing this =
right now. There&#x27;s no access concerns like moving things to a new =
instance and they don&#x27;t have logging criteria and they all should have=
 their own laptops. The only potential technology needs would be if like =
somebody, let&#x27;s say forgot their charger. But if we all have =
conventionally the same laptops, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a, an issue=
 because they borrow somebody else&#x27;s. So I think we are good. But I =
think that&#x27;s a good call out. Maybe review that one Vicki, with Pierce=
. I don&#x27;t know that we need to add it as an action because I =
can&#x27;t currently think of anything. Maybe just like ask Pierce that =
question on Monday just in case. Okay, Mac, you&#x27;re updating the =

are, oh, and I need to set up the take off call F4 under MoS and Comms. We =
need another one. Just say Jessica to send out kickoff call and Vicki to =
review material for peers to present on Monday. I&#x27;ll likely be on that=
 call too, Vicki, but I just want to make sure we note it on here like =
I&#x27;m setting it up. Vicki, you&#x27;ve done a good job of like =
we&#x27;re 80, 85% there with the content, but we need to review that with =
Pearson on Monday and then he&#x27;s going to do the actual presentation. =
So the four things that I owe is, Vicki, the email addresses, which is the =
first thing I&#x27;m going to do as soon as we get off the call, I need to =
finish the schedule. I need to set up the SIT and the UAT calls and then =
set up the kickoff call. But actually I&#x27;m going to put the schedule =
last because I can do that over the weekend. I want to make sure we get =
these calls set up before end of day. All right, Mac, if you can email that=
 out to all of us, I think that&#x27;s a good one to send. And then Vicki, =
I see that you have this up here. Do you want us to take one last read of =
it or did you have a question? I think we&#x27;re good then. So let&#x27;s =
all just. Oh, Mac, you can jump and Vicki and I can just chat real quick. I=
