# Meeting Summary =20
**Date:** June 6, 2025 =20
**Participants Mentioned:** Rakesh, Sakai, Anish=
, Elaine, Sukai, Sean, Rob, Rashid, Andrew, Paul, Angela, Alan, Shreya, =
Corey, Dan, Charles, Mickey, Vince, Mac, Yanji, Tom, Steve, Jeff, BOSCAR, =
Bill

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Tsax Deliverables and Urgent =
Priorities
- **Status:** A version was reviewed with Sakai in the afternoon=
. Further review set for Monday.
- **Timeline Pressures:** Acceleration =
needed due to stakeholder requests and lead time for Form 10 pro forma work=
.
- **BRV UAT Preparation:** Jeff-related tasks need to be ready for User =
Acceptance Testing (UAT).
- **Additional Tasks:** Several parallel =
priorities with some noted as not fully itemized in the conversation.
- **General Mood:** High stress and workload, acknowledgment of =
"acceleration" expectations.

### 2. Statement of Work (SOW) Feedback and =
Staffing/Scoping
- **Feedback from Anish:** Discussion required if there =
are updates to scoping or changes in physical separation.
- **Staffing Discussions:** Need to clarify number of required resources (e=
.g., one or two people per assignment).
- **Pricing Model:** Rakesh is =
revising the pricing model to reflect changes, with assistance from Elaine =
(input on unstructured data). This will go to Sukai over the weekend and be=
 reviewed on Monday.
- **Staffing for Hypercare and Cutover:**=20
    - Unclear alignment with PMO on post-cutover and hypercare staffing.
    - Cutover events aim for October 1 readiness, with key technical =
cutover happening around October 27 and potentially through November 1.
    - Planning for 1=E2=80=932 weeks of hypercare support post-cutover, not=
 six weeks.
    - Escalation and governance structures for hypercare =
require definition.
    - Gap identified: Hypercare support and escalation =
not yet included in SOW, needs discussion with Sukai and further alignment =
with Service Management Office (SMO).

### 3. Hypercare and Cutover Support=
 Alignment
- **ServiceNow Transition:** Going live in August, parallel =
usage for BRV for up to 2 months prior to Day 1.
- **Support Structure =
Unclear:** Not included in current SOW; Rob=E2=80=99s SMO team=E2=80=99s =
scope is limited (currently only one tagged person for IT cutover); more =
alignment with Rob needed.
- **Governance and Roles:** Clarification needed=
 on communication, governance, and escalation for end users after help desk=
 transition.

### 4. Ramp-up/Ramp-down and Resourcing in Pricing
- **Ramped Resourcing:** Current four-month flat resourcing model under =
review.=20
- **Potential Surge and Taper:** Example =
provided=E2=80=94headcount may rise in September (peak activity), then =
decrease in October as deliverables close out.
- **Aim:** More dynamic, =
thoughtful modeling for client perception and real needs.

### 5. All IT Connect and Communications Planning
- **Preparation for =
Senior Discussions:** Need to present updates to teams in =E2=80=9CAll IT =
Connect=E2=80=9D sessions.
- **Schedule:** New deck requested, talking =
points to be collaboratively refined.
- **Paul=E2=80=99s Inclusion:** =
Runback through Paul for buy-in, meeting to be scheduled for Monday =
afternoon or possibly Tuesday, recognizing Sean=E2=80=99s travel and time =
zone constraints.

### 6. Microsoft Licensing and Tenant Migration Timing
- **Procurement Update:** Microsoft (in Athens negotiations) provided only =
a 30-day grace period to end of November.
    - Extension required for =
license coexistence during data migration from Honeywell to Solstice.
    - Standard grace expectations are 90 days, but could push for 180 days.
    - Major risk if timeframe is insufficient to migrate users, especially =
if anything is missed during the initial migration.
    - Need to push for longer extension and confirm with Alan.
    - Pricing for Solstice post-Day 1 confirmed, as well as specifics on =
=E2=80=9Cdouble bubble=E2=80=9D licensing periods.

### 7. Budget/Actuals and Contract Separation
- **Budget Review:** Agenda =
for Monday is set. Awaiting updated data from Vanilla on Monday.
- **Contract Separation:** Andrew confirmed the process has started, with =
Shreya handling documentation and guidance in place for governance.

### 8. HGS Workstreams: =20
#### 8.1. User Access Journey
- **Alignment:** Team aligned on user access journey; Mickey to lead =
execution, working closely with Rashid and Anish.
- **Timeline:** Target =
for all user access sections (applications going live on 8/1) is June 20. =
=20
- **Integration:** Work will feed into TSA exit planning workshop.

#### 8.2. Splunk Security Monitoring
- **Issue:** Splunk monitoring for the=
 landing zone on 8/1 at risk due to DCN=E2=80=99s timelines.
- **Meetings:** HGS internal call planned for Monday to discuss impact and =
potential solutions.
    - Key concern: Security gap if DCN cannot =
accelerate.
- **Risk Exception Process:** A risk exception request raised; =
need formal process, documentation, and approvals, possibly requiring =
Honeywell Splunk as interim solution.
- **Impact:** Gap is a significant =
security risk; unlikely business will accept =E2=80=9Cflying =
blind=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94may require rework, resource increases, and =
temporary use of previous tools.

#### 8.3. Domain Migration
- **Progress:** A list of impacted areas is being compiled; main challenge =
is SSO rebuild.=20
- **Next Steps:** Meeting with IAM team Monday to =
confirm details. Review with Yanji later next week.
- **Effort Estimation:** Need clear assessment (could be 8=E2=80=9350 items=
 or more) to determine if work is absorbable internally or requires =
client-funded scope expansion.

### 9. User Migration Pilot Planning
- **Pilot Users:** A validation list is being developed; meeting with Steve=
 planned for next week.

### 10. BRV System Readiness and UAT

# End of Summary

Transcript:
0:00
In the meantime, we're getting =
pushed some more. Rakesh will probably talk about it on some of the gate =
deliverables. We got to get the Tsax stuff wrapped up real soon. We =
reviewed a version of it with Sakai this afternoon and we're doing it again=
 on Monday because we have to start getting some of the form 10 pro forma =
stuff done and that's going to require a little bit more lead time. So I =
think that's probably like the most burning stuff right now. In addition to=
, you know, getting all the Jeff stuff ready for BRV UAT back. The stuff =
you're pushing, we gotta push really hard on that stuff and get that done =
quick and probably a bunch of other stuff and what I forgot in there.

0:39
Yeah, my brain is as clear as mud, but I'm just trying to hold it together =
this afternoon. But no, you. I think you covered. I caught the lat tail end=
 of it and yeah, it's just, just there are lots of things that are actually=
, you know, that are we were doing. It's just a bit of an acceleration on =
some of these things that different stakeholders are requesting a bit early=
. But yeah, starting of. Speaking of sow. Yeah, please, if I know. Anish, =
we got feedback from you. We have to, you know, if you want to change your =
physical separation, let's talk through some of the, you know, if you've =
got updates to scoping grade, we have to talk through some of the staffing =
on this as well. Right. So do you need one person or two or. Right. If =
you're, if you're a third here, a third there and a third there, you know.

1:37
Yeah, we got to think through that.

1:40
So again, I'm working on the=
 pricing model as well that's also going out to Sukai this weekend, a =
version of it that we'll get on Monday to talk to her. So over this weekend=
, do ping me if you have some pricing model. I think, you know, Elaine gave=
 me some for the unstructured data piece but, you know, we need to think =
through for the others.

2:02
The only other question I have on the SOW is =
have we aligned with the PMO on how much hypercare and cutover support =
we're going to have and what the team looks like for that work stream =
because there's a lot of work there.

2:20
Hypercare support. Are you =
talking post? So explain. There are so many hypercare, so I want to know =
which ones.

2:27
So when I say cutover and hypercare, I'm talking about =
cutover and hypercare up to day one. So at October, we're going to take it =
all the way out to October 1st or October 27th or November 1st, wherever we=
 met landing. Then we're going to need to have a warring set up there as =
well to support all of the hyper care tickets and stuff. So I just want to =
understand if we're staffing that if we're leaving the governance behind it=
, what our role is in that and if we're appropriately staffed to support.

3:07
Okay, so let me approach it a couple of ways. Our expectation is that =
we. So I get your point, we should think through that. The expectation is =
from an application perspective everything would have cut over, everything =
would be ready by, you know, whatever needs to by October 1st. So the last =
two weeks of it is really just hardening, if you will, for lack of a better=
 analogy on the HR side there's a lot of cutover people cut over happening =
in the last two weeks. But you're right in that the flipping the switch =
technically on October 27th shouldn't mean much for it. But having said =
that, there's likely one to two weeks of hypercare we all need. I don't =
suspect we will have six weeks of hypercare support. We would likely need =
to define a structure in place and say, okay, there'll be one to two weeks =
of support for hypercare at best.

4:07
Well, an escalation process I'm =
sure as well, because we can. The issue is the number of the folks that =
typically call for their help desk is they're not going to have that =
support anymore because it's going to be an solstice environment. So the =
communication around that, the governance around that and the new =
escalation processes around that need to be in place, they'll need to be =
defined. And I assume that we're taking that role to support.

4:33
I do not know yet. It's a good question. I don't think we have talked about=
 that yet, so I know Rashid's not here to talk about. So ServiceNow is =
going live in August and so even for BRV and in and around brv, you know, =
they've got a parallel service now that they'll run for two months. So =
tickets will come in as apps move in, tickets will come into their service =
now and they'll be routed, etc. So that will work itself for a month or two=
 until day one. So the. But purely from a hypercare perspective of things =
cutting over in October, we have to talk through. We have not included it =
in isow. It's a valid point to say, okay, what is that model going to look =
like or support structure for a week or two. I don't think it was our =
intention. It's something we need to perhaps talk through to Sukai as well =
Sean and say this is not in our current purview. This is a, you know, know =
a plus plus.

5:35
So I mean on the topic of COVID and hypercare, I do =
think we need to collaborate with the SMO team though on what are we =
proposing at the top because there is a team that Rob has put together that=
 does include some cutover management for it. There's a role in there that =
we haven't landed yet that is not enough for all of this stuff but is =
something as a starting point.

5:58
So I just. We need to.

6:02
What is it that we think we need and what's the scope of it and then we can=
 solve for it.

6:08
Understood. So if we're plugging into the smos broader=
 thing, you can do that and then we can kind of hopefully land and expand =
that way. If it's something that we're proposing separately. That's not a =
question.

6:21
We're not looking to propose it separately. And I don't =
know how the scope of Rob's thing because he's also limiting his scope =
there. Sean. Yeah, I was just on another call with him on even the cutover =
over the UAT and the process around end to end process testing. He is not =
staffing up to do that. He doesn't think businesses either so he's =
expecting it to do some of that. So there's a whole big lot of alignment to=
 do with him and pre. But that apart, I don't think his hypercare cut over =
stand command center cut over hypercare model supports extensive support. =
So right now it's one person that's tagged into his, into his scope. I =
don't think there's room for another unless we make the case there. But =
certainly for our it there isn't a hypercare support in our structure =
construct today.

7:20
Okay.

7:21
We can keep that as a gap and maybe have=
 that as a. When we talk to Sukai we can say this is also something we need=
.

7:26
Yeah. I have another thought that building on something that Bill =
had brought up too that we can talk about around like at some point we're =
going to have to think about the split where we have a team that needs to =
stay with Honeywell for this to do TSA management that's probably a =
hypercare team that splinters off and then the rest goes with. But we can =
talk about that. I think it's we plant the seed at this point and then =
structure it.

7:51
Question for you on that, Andrew, you had hand raised, =
so why don't you go first before I ask my question to Sean?

7:59
No, this was pricing, saying that I had an initial pricing model in the =
Excel sheet, but might be outdated with the change.

8:06
Yeah, I've been working on that and I'm continuing to work on that. So =
that's getting updated with how we're restructuring the teams, et cetera. =
Sean, I think in the pricing model there will be ramp up and ramp down. =
Because right now in our PowerPoint we have said four months on most of =
things. I think we may want to take a second look. I'll work with you over =
the weekend to see. Okay, what's a ramp up? What's a ramp down?

8:33
Okay, yeah, yeah. Anything we can do to try to keep it from just being flat=
 across the board. I think it'll help to show thoughtfulness.

8:41
And potentially some surge in the middle. You know what I'm thinking? =
Hypothetically, let's say we've got 12 people. It could become 15 in =
September, but it ramps down to eight.

8:52
Taper down on the sides.

8:53
Yeah, it ramps down to eight in October. Right, so we'll talk through that.=
 Okay, so that's the main one on sows and then the other things that Sean =
mentioned on, you know, the hype. Corey, you've been involved in it, so =
I'll bring you up to speed on that. And then Mac, we need to connect right =
after this and we also need the deck. So we need to talk through what we're=
 presenting to the, to the teams in the all it connect. So if you can put =
down a deck together and give us talking points, we can refine it.

9:27
Yep, sounds great. We'll connect after this for Keshe.

9:34
Sorry, just a bit all over the place there.

9:36
But yeah, well, we =
knocked off sow revisions as well. So I think the only other topic to bring=
 up here is that though we're connecting with Zakaria on Monday, we do need=
 to run this back through Paul on Tuesday just to kind of get some =
additional buy in here because they're going to have a conversation later =
in the week as well. So that'll give us that extra supporter as well.

9:59
Okay, so we'll set up some time on that for Paul on Tuesday. Sean, you're =
off. Correct. So we may have to do this Monday afternoon with Paul.

10:09
Yeah, not off, just at a different time.

10:10
No, you're, you're =
traveling, right? I mean, you're in a different time zone.

10:13
Yeah, I'm going to be available. But it's just going to be. We're =
especially for next week.

10:19
Week.

10:19
Next week is really bad. The =
week after that I'm in Europe so it's, it's not as bad.

10:23
Okay.

10:27
Someone told me he doesn't mind having problems at 1am his time.

10:32
So 1am Paul's time or my time? I go to sleep at 9 o' clock guys.

10:42
I mean 9 o' clock Hong Kong time is. Yeah, okay.

10:51
Okay.

10:52
Topics.

10:53
Yeah. PC rollout. So the, the piece here that's gonna happen=
 is we'll get with Rashid on Monday, understand where the risk that he =
raised came from within the team and then we'll loop that back in because =
that was a question from Paul and folks. So that's back on Monday.

11:09
Okay. And by the way and Andrew, please confirm this with procurement but =
the procurement lead and Angela told me that Microsoft in their =
negotiations for Athens only gave 30 day grace period till end of Novemb =
for the.

11:26
So I think I have a slide on Microsoft already. But =
basically for Microsoft we got a extension for 30 days to negotiate what's =
gonna happen to Honeywell as a whole. And this also somewhat ties in =
Solstice. But then basically. But then for Microsoft what's gonna happen is=
 between June or whenever they sign the new contract, Solstice is gonna =
have HoneyW as a one time double bubble between June or July till next May,=
 October 20, October 27 and then starting November 1 or whenever day one is=
 from day one until the next renewal date which may be June 1, they'll have=
 Solstice pricing at level D pricing which is like $49 or $52 per person.

12:17
It's a times 2.2 times 2.4 or something. Right?

12:21
Yeah. I shared a bunch of slides back.

12:23
There.

12:25
But this doesn't touc on how long they'll allow the licenses to coexist. So=
 and the Standard There is 90 days was our understanding from our kind of =
tech consulting folks that do this very frequently with the option where =
Microsoft can extend that up to 180 days and the reason that that matters =
is those licenses need to coexist while the data is being migrated from =
Honeywell to Solstice environment.

12:52
Yeah.

12:52
And that is being they will coexist between the purchase date and October =
27th which is three months. Is that not enough time to migrate to users or =
do we need some kind of extension there that I could probably tell Alan =
that we need to extend that.

13:08
The issue if it only goes to October =
27th is that if anything was missed which we know will happen. They need to=
 have extra time there.

13:20
Okay, yeah, I'll bring that up then.

13:23
So let's make it, you know, 90 days post October 27th or at least 30 days =
before post.

13:31
Okay, so it's the gist here is they need to have the =
tenants communicate to each other then, right? Yes, the Honeywell tenants =
and those tenants.

13:41
Yeah. For any. Any. Do. Any Mrs. Yep.

13:45
Okay. That's not. That's not a big issue. I think. So I could probably =
bring that up to him.

13:50
Yeah.

13:51
It's the duration of it. Yeah, =
yeah, I get it.

13:54
Yeah.

13:55
Is we should be pushing for the longest=
 extension possible, which is 180 days, which would give them three months.=
 Migrate anything that's missed. And it also creates an extra layer of =
comfort there for the folks we should be pushing for, especially given kind=
 of the size of Honeywell today, how big of a client that is for Microsoft.

14:17
Okay.

14:18
I don't think the contract hasn't signed yet, so let me=
 just bring that up then.

14:23
Okay.

14:24
I thought Andrew was saying =
October 2027. I was like, wow, who negotiated that? That's amazing. But =
yeah, fairly nuts.

14:33
No, that's pricing, Sir Charles. Pricing only.

14:38
Yeah.

14:38
Yeah.

14:39
Okay. So nothing to touch on. On the all it=
 connect. We have the agenda that's set for Monday. We don't have subpoena =
on the call, but that had. That was already finalized yesterday on budget =
versus actuals. Corey, I know you're working to get the updated data from =
Vanilla on Monday, so we'll follow up with you.

15:00
Dan.

15:02
Contract separation. Anything that you want to highlight here, Andrew?

15:08
No, I think I made a morning announcement saying that we are starting=
 the process. Shreya's dropping the letters and we're sending them over. =
And you can. I are pretty much guiding the whole overall process for review=
 and governance.

15:22
Perfect. All right. Moving over to the HGs with. =
We've got Charles here. I think we've got Mickey and Vince as well. So we =
had a discussion this afternoon on what we needed to get done from a user =
access journey perspective. The team is aligned. So Mickey is going to be =
leading some of that work, kind of touching in with Rashid. And we'll try =
to pull you into that as well. Anish. Specific to the applications that are=
 going live on 81 since you're going to have a hand in those. So we'll just=
 kind of want to update, make sure that you have eyes on that. So we'll =
have that discussion on Tuesday. The team will make revisions and we're =
going to Target 620 for everything around the user access journeys to be =
complete. And that's going to all get rolled up into the TSA exit planning =
workshop. Charles? Mickey, anything you want to add on that?

16:19
Nope, that's what we discussed and we're actually. So that's the plan. We =
already have a very solid draft, so let me not speak for Mickey. Mickey, do=
 you have anything to add? I'm good.

16:30
Nothing else for my end.

16:34
Yeah, Mickey, I want to make sure you do, because you're probably going to =
be doing a lot of the work here and driving that, so. Awesome. And then on =
the Splunk and the. The domain migration, anything that you guys have that =
you want to add in here? Sure.

16:49
So we had calls on both of these this=
 morning. Splunk, definitely. Still some things to figure out in terms of =
timing. That current timeline does not match with what HGS needs. So we've =
got an HGS internal call on Monday morning across all the different work =
streams to just kind of talk through exactly what we need to and what the =
possible solutions are if DCN cannot accelerate their timelines. And then =
we'll reconnect with the DCN owner and pm, who are also working to refine =
some of the details because they. They're still kind of piecing together =
the detailed project plan.

17:34
So I think that that discussion, Mickey, =
is where you're going to kind of double click on what are the =
implementations impacts if DCN can accelerate those timelines? Or do we =
kind of already know what that means for the business?

17:47
We, we know, we know when we need it right now it's not going to hit that. =
So we need to talk about, we need to get everyone aligned on what the, what=
 the alternate best alternative is if DCN cannot accelerate. They're =
working on that at the moment. BOSCAR was, was raising a procurement =
question because that seems to be where they are right now and trying to =
understand whether that can be sped up as well. But we don't have a clear =
POV yet on what the, you know, interim solution might have to be if DCN =
cannot accelerate sufficiently.

18:29
Belain, is your question. What, like=
, are we, are we articulating what the actual impact is? Right? Like what =
actually happens if we don't meet this deadline? Is that your question?

18:39
That is the question. So is it.

18:41
I mean, the impact. The impact=
 is security risk.

18:46
Security that the business is going to have to =
make a call on if they're willing to accept. So kind of what I'm driving at=
 here is the magnitude of the problem. Is it something that's going to =
impact day one and the ability to go live. Is it an inconvenience that's =
going to have to be approved by the IT team around risk acceptance on the =
security protocols, or is it something that potentially the cyber team can =
internally resolve and just speed up their internal processes? This is best=
 case scenario.

19:20
Yeah.

19:20
So as of now, with the current time =
timelines, there's going to be a gap in security monitoring for the landing=
 zone on 8 1, based on the DCN timeline. HCS uses Splunk, DCN owns it. So, =
you know, they're going to be lacking a tool. So, you know, we already put =
the.

19:41
Risk exception request in for that.

19:45
Sorry, Sean, what risk exception request is a risk exception?

19:50
Like whatever the process is for a risk exception? Like, has that review =
process already started? Is that gap.

20:00
If there's a formal process =
you're referring to? I'm not familiar with. You know, we've definitely had =
multiple conversations within HGs, including, you know, with incoming CISO =
about. About the scenario.

20:13
Yeah. I mean, I would just imagine. And =
typically with companies of this size, there is a formal, like, risk review=
 and exception process that they have to get like a documented risk =
exception prior to the risk being realized. And I don't know what their =
lead time is on that, but if it's, you know, more than a month, we should =
probably talk about getting it started.

20:38
Yeah. Okay, we'll add that =
to the agenda for Monday. Ideally, we're not going to, like, I think =
probably the answer is going to be they're not willing to accept that they =
can't monitor. So the question is, how does that get resolved? And it will =
mean some. It will likely mean rework. Right. That they'll have to somehow =
use Honeywell Splunk. Honeywell Splunk in the interim and then reintegrate =
the monitoring again in October, which, you know, people are going to be =
pissed about and may require some additional resources. But I don't think =
that the answer is going to be we're just going to fly blind for exit.

21:15
Yeah, you're absolutely right, Mickey. No way these guys accept.

21:19
So does that mean some TSAs we need to. Well, it's on TSA anyway. =
Never mind.

21:27
So what kind of compensating control or what can we do =
in the interim to make sure that we have the visibility that we need?

21:35
Yeah, Charles, I would imagine that that would all be part of the. =
The risk review process. Right. So anywhere there's a variation, I would =
assume that we have a. I mean, even based on. I mean, based on my Limited =
past experience on this. That to me sounds like it would still be an =
exception because the deviation from standard process and then there's. =
There's compensated controls as part of the exception that they approve. So=
 like all of that stuff. I'm just saying, like you guys are rattling this =
off. It's clear that people know it. Where is that written down in a. Is =
that codified in a way that when we get to where we need it, it's not going=
 to be revisited?

22:09
Yep, agreed, agreed. Socialized. Every is on paper=
, you know, audit trail, all that stuff. Yep, agreed. Mickey, we could take=
 that one. We could ask Tom what the process is, if any for doing that. But=
 you know, and it just, I mean create something and make sure it's, it's. =
It's blessed and socialized by. It's socialized and blessed by the people. =
What I need to bless it.

22:38
Okay, perfect. I think we've all got next =
step there. Mickey, anything you want to cover on domain migration?

22:47
So we met with Yongji this morning, have a list of identified impacted =
areas of the change to the domain. Some of them are already accounted for. =
There are a couple IT folks I'm in getting in contact with to confirm that =
their piece is done. The biggest, longest pole in the tent is going to be =
an SSO rebuild. So we're meeting with the IAM team Monday morning to =
confirm that and understand the implications and then also, you know, =
trying to see if there are any areas that the initial brainstorm missed =
that might also be in consideration. And just double click into those. And =
then the plan is to review the status of things with Yanji later next week.

23:33
Yeah. So on this one, Rakesh, we talked about this, this one as well=
. Right. Based on the conversation with Yanji, the view I'm guessing from =
them is that this is not some super heavy lift. And so if we come back and =
say, hey look, we're going to charge you, you know, blah, blah, blah, we =
need XYZ resources. It may not go over well. And so what we want to do is =
fully understand the level of effort. Right. Of what needs to be done. To =
Mickey's point, they said eight items, but it could be 15, it could be 50, =
we don't know. Right. Well, we need to go through that exercise and then =
based on that we huddle and say, hey look, is this something that we can =
absorb, you know, get some, some goodwill brownie points for, you know, as =
we are talking about all these additional, you know, work streams and asks =
from clients for does this go into that list as well. Right. So we have a =
conversation, Sukai on Monday and Rakesh and I aligned on including this. =
Just as you know, you know, FYI, this is also bubbling up. We're going to =
try to see if we can absorb it. But just that way, you know, when she's =
doing her round robin of stakeholder outreach to see if, you know, in fact =
asking for these services like she said she was going to do, this is what =
she also goes to ask young Jay Apollo about. And then they also confirmed. =
So that that's kind of the approach I think makes the most sense, but open =
to any other suggestions. And Rakesh, you came off mute, so.

24:59
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, I'm just wanting to. So if we get this as an a la =
carte to your point, we can list it. I'm just, my mind went to do I scope =
this as a six week exercise because everything else is a four month and I =
just mentioned that there'll be a ramp up and a ramp down. But this one, if=
 we, if we make the assumption that this is a bit of a heavy lift now, but =
it's a four week exercise.

25:22
Yeah.

25:24
Then, you know, we can list =
it and scope it and say, okay, this is 100k then okay, that's a freebie =
potentially.

25:29
Right.

25:30
But if it's 600k, okay, that's not a =
freebie. So I need that sort of a.

25:36
Yeah, but the challenge is, you =
know, we're not gonna get until my. Before Monday. And so I just want to =
make sure that in a way the same way you just described it is the same way =
we can describe it to Sky. So I think, because I think she's very smart, =
right. She gets it right. Like, hey, look, this just bubbled up. We had a =
call on Friday. This is what they're saying is going to take. But we always=
 know that, you know, that it's always, you know, a little bit of like =
ambition with some of these numbers.

26:02
Right.

26:02
Or these. Yeah, right. So we want to do our own sort of due diligence to =
figure out exactly what needs to be done. We have a couple contact people =
that we need to reach out to, to. And then based on that, we'll come back =
to you to say whether or not this is incremental just because we can't =
absorb it like we physically cannot, or if it's something that we can't =
absorb because, you know, we'll just find a way. And you know, we love =
working with you and we want to make sure that we.

26:25
I think I prefer the part where we cannot physically absorb it. So. Because=
 Mickey, then I would need to get with you just to give me a, two, three =
bullets of this so I can add it to the. The conversation with her.

26:37
Yeah, so I think we can just pull what Yanji had in her email somehow. =
Mickey, I don't know if you took a screenshot, but I think she also added. =
Added it to the invite.

26:45
So yeah, we have, we have ready.

26:48
So send it to me over the weekend. Not now. It's not an urgent. Relatively =
urgent. I do not want to make anyone spend time on this or you know, lose =
their sleep on the weekend.

27:00
On the weekend. You rather make them?

27:02
No, no, no. Okay, then send it to me now, Nikiti. And don't work on =
the weekend.

27:07
Rakesh will see your bluff and raise you.

27:12
Sorry, Mickey, I'm going to that lake house on this weekend. There are kids=
 in this, in this program, so I got to keep it PG 13.

27:20
So Mickey, the story here is either today, if you have time, or this =
weekend. So you have some flexibility. But yeah, either way it's needed by.

27:28
I'm gonna consult, I'm gonna consolidate it Sunday night. So. Okay. =
Sometime before now and then is fine. Okay.

27:36
Okay, perfect. Moving on=
. So the user migration planning that we have on the right side is around =
the pilot list of users that were developed and to be validated. Rakesh, =
Mickey, I know you guys were going to chat with Steve. Did you have a =
chance to do that?

27:54
I have not had the chance to do that.

27:56
Okay, we'll roll that into next week. So BRB readiness and uat. Anish, I =
know that you've shared a slide.

28:05
It's not Anish, that's Mac.

28:07
Okay. Matt, anything you want to update here?

28:12
Yeah, Rakesh, how did the call go with Sukai? There's a couple things that =
we're working on, aligning the data with the PMO folks. So we had a meeting=
 with the Capital Edge team today and what we're looking to do is get the =
systems data that we've now compiled from the systems tracker on our side =
with the resource names and get all of that unified and loaded into Capital=
 Edge so the Capital Edge team can build dashboards like the burndown and =
the other system process mapping directly there. So we are going to send =
them our model. But Rakesh met with Sukai today with Sean. I think you were=
 there probably too. And I think that there were some actions coming out of=
 that as well. And then we have some things for the all IT connect next =
week. System ownerships and call to actions.

29:02
Right So a lot to actually take in and digest. But the portion that Mac men=
 mentioned is around the systems and not to, you know, boil this call on it=
, but there's a simpler portion around the systems where we can leverage =
the existing reporting or the existing data model that's there in Capital =
Edge will report on it. There's a broader ask around how are you going to =
manage all the end to end, how are you going to manage the functional =
process testing? So from a UAT system readiness it's the, the system is =
ready for UAT done. The functions will go in and validate the functional =
UATs, the processes that are local to functions through this UAT. There =
needs to be some visibility, traceability and reporting on that. There's a =
third layer which is the end to end process testing. So if you think of, =
you know, how do I create a new customer in my CRM and they are allowed to =
take a, an order all the way down into the ERP on how do I raise an invoice=
 for it, how do I bill them back and you know, et cetera. So there is a lot=
 of conversation that needs to happen around how do we manage that end to =
end process, how do we report on it, how do we govern it, how do we =
understand where process breaks down, how do we fix that? That filters down=
 to the same lower level of if it's just a functional process test, if =
something breaks, how you do we report on it? And then down to from a =
system perspective, systems working or not working, how do we report on it?=
 So there's a, there's a sort of a three layer view of this, some of this =
that Sean alluded to earlier around Cutover Hypercare, you know the model =
we spoke about, but cut over Hypercare, defect resolution and governance, =
etc. So there's a lot to think about, a lot more moving parts. In the =
meantime, Jeff wants a view of the hypercar governance structure and he =
wants to roll the marble on that. He wants to run some tabletop exercises =
in next month as we run through this. So what Mac and I are looking at =
starting with the Monday all IT connect is to give a view of the systems =
view but importantly set up these connects with the functions to understand=
 from an end to end process view what are the processes that are truly =
changing, what systems do they touch and what is this MOS that we need to =
set up between these coordinators so that they fully understand, you know, =
what is changing and what is the progress, et cetera. So more to come on =
that Mac and I will connect and then we'll share more info as we get with =
the team.

31:51
So has that content that you're planning to share for the =
IT All Connect been develop, developed, and has it been shared with Sakina?

32:00
We talked about that. So we'll get that to Sakina before Monday.

32:04
Before Monday. All right, moving on. So next item that we have here =
is around the Data Governance board. So this is the unstructured data =
discussion.

we&#x27;re going to need to have a warring set up there as well to support =
all of the hyper care tickets and stuff. So I just want to understand if =
we&#x27;re staffing that if we&#x27;re leaving the governance behind it, =
what our role is in that and if we&#x27;re appropriately staffed to support=
.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;background-color=

approach it a couple of ways. Our expectation is that we. So I get your =
point, we should think through that. The expectation is from an application=
 perspective everything would have cut over, everything would be ready by, =
you know, whatever needs to by October 1st. So the last two weeks of it is =
really just hardening, if you will, for lack of a better analogy on the HR =
side there&#x27;s a lot of cutover people cut over happening in the last =
two weeks. But you&#x27;re right in that the flipping the switch =
technically on October 27th shouldn&#x27;t mean much for it. But having =
said that, there&#x27;s likely one to two weeks of hypercare we all need. I=
 don&#x27;t suspect we will have six weeks of hypercare support. We would =
likely need to define a structure in place and say, okay, there&#x27;ll be =
one to two weeks of support for hypercare at best.</div></div><div =

6">Well, an escalation process I&#x27;m sure as well, because we can. The =
issue is the number of the folks that typically call for their help desk is=
 they&#x27;re not going to have that support anymore because it&#x27;s =
going to be an solstice environment. So the communication around that, the =
governance around that and the new escalation processes around that need to=
 be in place, they&#x27;ll need to be defined. And I assume that we&#x27;re=
 taking that role to support.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;p=

their service now and they&#x27;ll be routed, etc. So that will work itself=
 for a month or two until day one. So the. But purely from a hypercare =
perspective of things cutting over in October, we have to talk through. We =
have not included it in isow. It&#x27;s a valid point to say, okay, what is=
 that model going to look like or support structure for a week or two. I =

 have that discussion on Tuesday. The team will make revisions and =
we&#x27;re going to Target 620 for everything around the user access =

from them is that this is not some super heavy lift. And so if we come back=
 and say, hey look, we&#x27;re going to charge you, you know, blah, blah, =
blah, we need XYZ resources. It may not go over well. And so what we want =
to do is fully understand the level of effort. Right. Of what needs to be =
done. To Mickey&#x27;s point, they said eight items, but it could be 15, it=
 could be 50, we don&#x27;t know. Right. Well, we need to go through that =
exercise and then based on that we huddle and say, hey look, is this =
something that we can absorb, you know, get some, some goodwill brownie =
points for, you know, as we are talking about all these additional, you =
know, work streams and asks from clients for does this go into that list as=
 well. Right. So we have a conversation, Sukai on Monday and Rakesh and I =
aligned on including this. Just as you know, you know, FYI, this is also =
bubbling up. We&#x27;re going to try to see if we can absorb it. But just =
that way, you know, when she&#x27;s doing her round robin of stakeholder =
outreach to see if, you know, in fact asking for these services like she =
said she was going to do, this is what she also goes to ask young Jay =
Apollo about. And then they also confirmed. So that that&#x27;s kind of the=
 approach I think makes the most sense, but open to any other suggestions. =

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Yeah, Rakesh, how =
did the call go with Sukai? There&#x27;s a couple things that we&#x27;re =
working on, aligning the data with the PMO folks. So we had a meeting with =
the Capital Edge team today and what we&#x27;re looking to do is get the =
systems data that we&#x27;ve now compiled from the systems tracker on our =
side with the resource names and get all of that unified and loaded into =
Capital Edge so the Capital Edge team can build dashboards like the =
burndown and the other system process mapping directly there. So we are =
going to send them our model. But Rakesh met with Sukai today with Sean. I =
think you were there probably too. And I think that there were some actions=
 coming out of that as well. And then we have some things for the all IT =
connect next week. System ownerships and call to actions.</div></div><div =

.6">Right So a lot to actually take in and digest. But the portion that Mac=
 men mentioned is around the systems and not to, you know, boil this call =
on it, but there&#x27;s a simpler portion around the systems where we can =
leverage the existing reporting or the existing data model that&#x27;s =
there in Capital Edge will report on it. There&#x27;s a broader ask around =
how are you going to manage all the end to end, how are you going to manage=
 the functional process testing? So from a UAT system readiness it&#x27;s =
the, the system is ready for UAT done. The functions will go in and =
validate the functional UATs, the processes that are local to functions =
through this UAT. There needs to be some visibility, traceability and =
reporting on that. There&#x27;s a third layer which is the end to end =
process testing. So if you think of, you know, how do I create a new =
customer in my CRM and they are allowed to take a, an order all the way =
down into the ERP on how do I raise an invoice for it, how do I bill them =
back and you know, et cetera. So there is a lot of conversation that needs =
to happen around how do we manage that end to end process, how do we report=
 on it, how do we govern it, how do we understand where process breaks down=
, how do we fix that? That filters down to the same lower level of if =
it&#x27;s just a functional process test, if something breaks, how you do =
we report on it? And then down to from a system perspective, systems =
working or not working, how do we report on it? So there&#x27;s a, =
there&#x27;s a sort of a three layer view of this, some of this that Sean =
alluded to earlier around Cutover Hypercare, you know the model we spoke =
about, but cut over Hypercare, defect resolution and governance, etc. So =
there&#x27;s a lot to think about, a lot more moving parts. In the meantime=
, Jeff wants a view of the hypercar governance structure and he wants to =
roll the marble on that. He wants to run some tabletop exercises in next =
month as we run through this. So what Mac and I are looking at starting =
with the Monday all IT connect is to give a view of the systems view but =
importantly set up these connects with the functions to understand from an =
end to end process view what are the processes that are truly changing, =
what systems do they touch and what is this MOS that we need to set up =
between these coordinators so that they fully understand, you know, what is=
 changing and what is the progress, et cetera. So more to come on that Mac =
and I will connect and then we&#x27;ll share more info as we get with the =
team.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;background-c=
