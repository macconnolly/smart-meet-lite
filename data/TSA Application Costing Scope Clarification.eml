Meeting Summary: TSA Application Costing and Scope Clarification

*Date:* June 4, 2025
------------------------------
Attendees

   - IT leadership and migration team (names such as Harry, James, Paul,
   Arpit, Angela, Gokul, Kelly, Gary Hamby, Sukai, Dora Cecily, Rashid, Ray=
,
   Anish, Ravi, etc.)
   - Finance and business representatives
   - Application and data center leads

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *TSA Applications: Scope, Inventory, and
Classification*

   - *Full TSA Coverage:*
      - 108 applications marked as having full TSA (Transition Service
      Agreement) support including app support, maintenance, hosting, netwo=
rk,
      licensing, etc.
      - Subset of apps (approximately 84 or 60 to be confirmed) are =E2=80=
=9Cbuild
      back and move as-is=E2=80=9D applications, hosted in the landing zone
and incurring
      hosting costs.
   - *TSA Types:*
      - Distinction between =E2=80=9CFull TSA=E2=80=9D (with app support an=
d maintenance)
      and =E2=80=9CHosting TSA=E2=80=9D (hosting only, with no app support)=
.
      - Ownership and flagging in the app inventory: Inventory should
      clearly indicate applications as full or hosting TSA, and include
      checkboxes for support, maintenance, or hosting components.
   - *Hosting Only TSAs:*
      - Around 30 servers expected to be under "Hosting TSA" only.
      - Need to coordinate with the database and hosting teams to produce
      accurate, up-to-date server and app inventories.
      - Emphasis on using a familiar and established charter format for
      defining application ownership/support scope.

2. *Data Collection, Ownership, and Gaps*

   - *Application Lists and Costs:*
      - Ongoing work to clarify which applications are under IT or business
      management.
      - Noted confusion around 63 applications not in =E2=80=9CBusiness Sco=
pe=E2=80=9D.
      Some business functions have identified a need for these (e.g.,
finance and
      engineering).
      - Discussion on identifying funding sources for =E2=80=9Cout of scope=
=E2=80=9D
      apps=E2=80=94clarification required whether IT is responsible or if
costs are borne
      by business units (with SaaS solutions typically outside IT scope).
      - Unresolved questions regarding whether business-managed
      applications run on IT infrastructure or require IT resources.
   - *Application-Level Funding Responsibility:*
      - Need to validate assumptions concerning apps wholly
      purchased/supported by the business, e.g., if business buys
      off-the-shelf/SaaS, IT may not incur related costs.

3. *TSA and Standalone Costing Models*

   - *Cost Modeling by Application Group:*
      - Emphasis on tracking cost categories: hosting, license,
      maintenance, network, compute, storage, etc.
      - Discrepancy between cost documentation and actual application
      disposition=E2=80=94need for more rigorous governance/change control =
is
identified.
      - Differences in completeness and data quality between TSA and
      Standalone lists; focus has been on TSAs, with Standalone
applications data
      lagging.
   - *Pending Data:*
      - Incomplete data, especially from engineering (22 apps), finance
      (notably Auto Bank app), and from certain teams or individuals
(Gary Hamby,
      Gokul, Rajesh).
      - Need for breakdowns by fixed vs variable costs=E2=80=94especially f=
or items
      like DCN (Data Center Network) and network/circuit costs.
   - *Recent/Planned Adjustments:*
      - Correction of license cost inconsistencies (e.g., Data Intelligence
      apps had $0 license cost erroneously reported).
      - Confirmation and correction of duration assumptions (e.g., ERP TSA
      support likely to be 9=E2=80=9312 months, not just 6 months).
      - Verification of role-based access and licensing costs (e.g.,
      SuccessFactors cost per license per user).
      - Standalone ERP costing must include run costs during physical
      separation/migration.

4. *Ongoing Data Gaps and Delinquent Actions*

   - *Escalation and Follow-up:*
      - Several escalations required for outstanding data requests,
      particularly for infrastructure figures for TSA, application-level co=
st
      breakdowns, and DCN/server breakdown (e.g., cases where
individuals missed
      agreed deadlines).
      - Plan to document all pending items and communicate follow-up to
      leadership (Sukai, Pierce).
      - Schedule set to complete collection and validation by Friday, ahead
      of the June 13th internal deadline.

5. *TSA Costing =E2=80=93 Specific Application Areas*

   - *Key Application Groups:*
      - *ERP:* Monthly run cost is $400k (projected for 9 months minimum;
      total cost $3.6M).
      - *Non-ERP (Finance, HSE, Legal):* Pending validation and correction
      of marked retire/build-back apps.
      - *CCX:* Near-complete, pending two application validations, further
      fixed/variable costing split required.
      - *HR/IT (SuccessFactors):* License calculated at $6.20 per user for
      two months (rounded to approx. $1,000 for 100 users).
      - *Dex:* Covers Enterprise Voice for four sites, broken down by
      license and usage.
      - *Infra/Network:* Need more clarity on circuit/network costs
      (currently being bundled with DCN), and a more granular
breakdown (compute,
      network, storage, fixed/variable).

6. *Contractual TSAs*

   - *Unresolved Items:*
      - Need to list and cost contracts that drive continued service beyond
      app migration (e.g., contracts for SAP assignability).
      - Intention to include zero-cost TSAs where Honeywell continues
      certain services solely for the TSA transition period.
      - Necessity to track and differentiate contracts relevant to TSA from
      those that are not.

7. *Governance, Documentation, and Reporting*

   - *Governance Concerns:*
      - Unstructured change management and lack of consistent process for
      additions/removals to the TSA list=E2=80=94instances of applications
being added by
      stakeholders without proper approval.
   - *Audit Trail and Documentation:*
      - Emphasis on maintaining email records of data requests, approvals,
      and escalations=E2=80=94for audit and accountability.
   - *Reporting Deadlines:*
      - Major internal reporting deadline of June 13th for final cost and
      scope documentation.
      - Substantial progress expected on missing data and scope validation
      by Friday (June 6th).

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *App Inventory and Classification*
   - Update inventory to clearly flag applications as Full TSA or Hosting
      TSA; include component-level support/hosting/maintenance fields.
      - Confirm ownership for all applications and whether costs are IT or
      business-borne, especially for the 63 =E2=80=9Cout of Business Scope=
=E2=80=9D apps.
   2.

   *Data Collection and Gaps*
   - Create a master list of applications/servers pending cost and scope
      data=E2=80=94assign owners for each data point.
      - Escalate outstanding data requests (Gary Hamby, Gokul, Rajesh,
      others) to Pierce and Sukai as needed. Ensure documentation of email
      requests and responses.
      - Schedule follow-up with Dora Cecily (engineering app costs), Rashid
      (Dex costs), Anish (ERP separation costs), Arpit (network/storage cos=
ts),
      and Ravi (Data Intelligence licensing).
   3.

   *Cost Model Completion*
   - Apply known cost splits (fixed vs variable) per application and
      service (esp. for DCN, network, compute, storage).
      - Break down total category costs in summary sheets=E2=80=94add granu=
larity
      for Finance, HSE, CCX, ERP, HR/IT, Dex, etc.
      - Load application numbers by group, ensuring all individual apps are
      accounted for (no blanks/assumptions).
   4.

   *Governance/Process*
   - Enforce governance process for application movement on/off the TSA
      list, requiring documented approvals/change control.
      - Ensure all cost model changes are accompanied by clear written
      assumptions and rationale.
   5.

   *Contractual TSAs and Special Cases*
   - Identify all TSAs driven by contract timing or assignability issues;
      document and cost accordingly.
      - Distinguish and tag zero-cost TSAs where Honeywell completes the
      service at no incremental charge.
   6.

   *Standalone and Migration Costing*
   - Finalize standalone applications cost model=E2=80=94include personnel,
      application, infrastructure, and migration cost buckets.
      - Secure up-to-date figures for Standalone ERP physical migration and
      run costs.
   7.

   *Reporting and Documentation*
   - Ensure all assumptions, calculations, and exceptions are explicitly
      documented in cost model comments.
      - Prepare a consolidated report for Sukai summarizing gaps, risks,
      and next steps in advance of June 13.

------------------------------
Follow-up Items & Scheduled Meetings

   -

   *Immediate:*
   - Final list of missing costs/data owners to be created and distributed
      for follow-up.
      - Multiple calls to be scheduled: with Gary Hamby (infra), Gokul
      (supply chain cost validation), Rajesh/Ravi (Data Intelligence),
Anish (ERP
      migration), Rashid (Dex), Dora Cecily (engineering apps).
      - Gokul call for supply chain app costs targeted for Friday morning
      India time (June 6 local).
      - Weekly call to escalate unresolved items and review progress
      (attendees to include Pierce, Sukai).
      - Prepare table by Friday listing all missing app/cost data for
      leadership review.
   -

   *By June 13, 2025:*
   - Deliver final cost model with documentation of all TSAs, Standalone,
      and migration-related costs, including funding responsibility validat=
ion
      for =E2=80=9Cout of scope=E2=80=9D applications.
      - Reconcile all disputed app inclusions (e.g., those added without
      proper process) and flag for change control review.

------------------------------
Additional Notes

   - *Operating Model Confusion:* Historical operating model definitions
   (IT support vs. business-managed) have not been firmly applied, leading =
to
   revisiting previously decided scope. Resolution and documentation of the=
se
   boundaries are now urgent, especially under time pressure.
   - *Data Ownership:* Persistent challenges obtaining committed data from
   certain teams require higher-level intervention and documentation for
   accountability.
   - *Cost Sensitivity:* Multiple mentions of the importance of materiality
   (<10% variance), accurate annualization of costs, and not double-countin=
g
   infrastructure/server line items across categories.
   - *Communication:* Consistent documentation, visibility, and escalation
   are necessary due to distributed team, complexity, and looming deadlines=
.

Harry0:00
Full blown TSA, the 108 of them. We're going to get app support,
maintenance, hosting, network, all that stuff. So there will be a subset of
it that is, that is infra for full TSA apps. Right. Posting cost. For full
TSA apps, There are a subset 84 or the 60 that are built back and move as
is. Those are hosted in the landing zone.
Oliver0:32
Yeah.
Harry0:32
There's hosting costs for those.
Oliver0:34
Yeah.
Harry0:35
Where are those accounted for? Are they in here as a subset?
Oliver0:39
They're in there as a subset. That number is still. We have a subset of
those. There's not many that are marked that need hosting out of the build
back and move as is. Okay. And so 50, 62.
Harry0:54
Right. So if you look at the migration arc. So when we came up with the
Maya, the disposition, we said there are some apps that are full TSAs.
There are some apps that are just hosting TSAs because they moved over
where the servers are still in apps have moved over license people taking
care of it. The hosting is still on the data center. I don't know.
Oliver1:20
Then the question is for those similar ones we do. They should be similar.
Harry1:25
They should have given us that list of just the hosting TSA servers.
Oliver1:29
So there may be 30 servers that.
Harry1:31
Are just under the hosting TSA.
Oliver1:33
Exactly what we did. I hear you. Yeah. So that list, what I've been going
on in the application for hosting as well is there is who owns that?
Harry1:53
It should be there. We should be marking in the app inventory whether it's
a full TSA or a hosting tsa. Yes, but in the components where we say does
it contain XYZ and a, we should say yeah, app support maintenance check.
Hosting check.
Oliver2:06
Yes.
Harry2:08
For intra hosting, there will be no app support maintenance. Follow me.
Oliver2:16
So they can't have both if you're infrastructure hosting.
Harry2:20
No, if you have a full tsa. So if I have. If you're flagging them per app
inventory, a full TSA will have app support maintenance, hosting network.
Oliver2:36
I've got a whole charter.
Harry2:38
In fact I'll send you a link to this. I have a whole charter pack and then
license.
Oliver2:43
Because I would suggest we use a similar format like this can be something
we allowed to call on around. Like this is what we used last time. Was
there anything like figure out lessons or if there's anything to change
from that. But we'll have this good starting point for something they're
familiar with, you know. Okay, I agree. Okay.
Harry3:01
So when they're giving us. The point is if you're asking the data database
team or the. The hosting team to give me milestones, give me all the
servers.
Oliver3:12
Yes. Yes. Okay.
Harry3:15
But we're going to have to take a look at it and say which of these apps
has a full TSA. Let's say 20 apps numbers. Just that. Let's say 100 apps
has 200 servers. So you're going to get. Have to get that Data for the 200
servers here for the hosting TSA. Maybe it's 20 apps, but it's got 50.
Oliver3:35
The rest of the stuff from that. So logistics and everything you could
steal because we did at the same place. I'm all for stealing heavily. Yes.
So anything that's built that column and she gave it to us and they're
going to support with the content input from the team now we'll be able.
Harry4:01
To leverage 10 plus.
Oliver4:03
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think that's okay. That's so not to digress and go.
Harry4:07
Down the rabbit hole, but let's go back.
Oliver4:09
Pull.
Harry4:09
Let's pull back up.
Oliver4:11
Let's walk through.
Harry4:14
Let's walk through costing this.
Oliver4:17
Yes.
Harry4:18
Okay. So you've got the data part of it. Data intelligence is how much does
it cost?
Oliver4:24
How much is the project? So yeah, we can. We can look into that first. Like
when does the.
Harry4:32
Like are you starting or if you're starting before.
Oliver4:41
I think there's a. I think they have crossings. I'll double check that. It
was not like.
Harry4:46
All right, so that's just.
Oliver4:47
Yeah, that was a couple very top down and then we went later behind them
and these guys went basically built into that.
Harry4:53
Yeah.
Oliver4:54
So I think that's good.
Harry4:55
The one.
Oliver4:56
One thing that goes overall for these is we started with that. What is now
a 102 number on the left.
Harry5:05
Okay.
Oliver5:05
There's also a. That's for. That's like in Business scope. There's also 63
applications that are not in Business Scope that we set aside. We're going
to include.
Harry5:15
Okay.
Oliver5:16
There are some in at least a few functions that they said they do need
those including the tsa.
Harry5:23
Okay.
Oliver5:24
They are. There are costs associated.
Harry5:26
Yeah but who's paying for that cost if it's not it and it supported
business should fund that cost for the 63.
Oliver5:35
Okay. Oliver. So for. For finance, the applications that Harry brought up
that are not in Business Scope, are those funded by it?
Harry5:47
We haven't really discussed the funding where we know we need to if it's
not it managed. So Business Scope is within Athens. Right. So the context
here is what I'm used to is not what's going on Here in Honeywell, if
you've got business managed apps, it's IT supporting these app support
maintenance, the hardware, the network licensing, if they're not in
business scope, if it's completely like it's not we need to know if is it
paying for any of this or for example like app support maintenance, is it
just somebody business buying something a subscription somewhere, does it
still provide some patching and Support for servers, etc. If it's a SaaS
solution then there's nothing like that. But does this they may say oh this
is needed but if business is paying for the whole thing, it is not. It
doesn't need to put that on a tsa. So we need to understand again I this is
my assumption. Tell me I'm wrong. I need to know what the details of that
63 are. Because if it is business somebody in commercial that buys an off
the shelf software that doesn't have servers, that's not in the hosted in
the data center and well it's not touching it.
Oliver7:05
It's not to say that the 63 applications need, need or have costs
associated with them. The functions have specifically called out that these
applications are in our scope. And so we may need to ask the clarifying
question of is this covered, is this supported by IT and are these buckets
covered to make sure that it's the right were cut? We're including in the
ITTSA and not somewhere else but there are a few in finance engineering.
Harry7:35
Why are they in finance?
Oliver7:37
Like so anything that's not in business scope here but shown credit card
world.
Harry7:41
Pay auto banking, fmd these are that probably business managers. Sorry, not
not saying but there I did say but I mean this is stuff that business
managers but it has no involvement over paying a fee for or maintaining
them. So this is where I want to validate this. And again keep in mind
there is an IT operating model, there's a business operating model. There
were business processes, systems contracts, this if it's a business managed
app then the business contract would need to take care of licensing for
this and everything else. Yeah, it would not be hosting these Again that's
the logic but understood. Tell me I'm wrong and that the 63 actually have
hosting and servers and cost that ID born.
Oliver8:28
So one example is this one here is high Radius hrc.
Harry8:32
Yeah that's a Radius Cash app if I'm not mistaken.
Oliver8:36
This was included in.
Harry8:37
It was add in as a. It was added back as a TSA or something. I don't know
what it was.
Oliver8:42
Right. It's not included in business scope. But it was included in the
finance. The cr. Yeah.
Harry8:49
That's the point is that sometimes the CR is just for adding an app in
scope.
Oliver8:53
It's not.
Harry8:53
It paid for it. I know, I know, I know, I know. But we should not be adding
it because now we're just.
Oliver8:58
It's.
Harry8:59
This is why business has got to. Okay, all right. We need to flag all of
these. Understood.
Oliver9:04
This is a topic that we need to, you know, this is, this is like figure
out. Because it's a.
Harry9:09
It's.
Oliver9:10
There's confusion across the different functions.
Harry9:12
I don't know why we're revisiting these. These were all sorted out in gate
one. Okay. Now I'm just expressing frustration that we went through an OP
model exercise and we said this is it managed, meaning all the stuff I
mentioned. And then there's stuff that business manages that it doesn't
like. If business pays for high radius, they need it. Put it on your TSA
list as a business tsa.
Oliver9:38
There are examples like Aspen in. I think that's a engineering application.
That's, that's quite probably their most expensive application.
Harry9:46
Okay.
Oliver9:46
It's not in business scope. It's a, It's a application that it pays for.
Harry9:51
Okay. It's being built back and so it's.
Oliver9:53
Not part of tsa, but it is an application, not a business scope. That's
united.
Harry9:57
So what is not in business scope?
Oliver10:00
This is, this is the. You know, we had this conversation a couple months
ago. I. There's criteria that Justin had said on what means in business.
Harry10:12
No, no, no. But like James and Paul and others should tell us what, what's
in business scope, what's not. We should have well documented back in gate
one.
Oliver10:19
We have a documentation of the four criteria Business scope.
Harry10:23
But again, we don't need to solve it. Now let's go back to the cost
costing. Sure. Let's, let's, let's walk through. Understood.
Oliver10:30
For, for TSA, we covered the buckets DC and being probably the.
Harry10:34
So are you including the 63 in the business scope or no?
Oliver10:39
No.
Harry10:40
Like, are you including them in this costing?
Oliver10:42
No.
Harry10:42
Okay, good.
Oliver10:43
No. So in the individual application sheets, like for. For CCX for example,
they have the 25 that are in business scope. And I believe there's maybe 10
others that they have included as modern Business scope that they need in
the tsa. What is what they have come back with? So we can, we can talk more
about that. But that's a general.
Harry11:06
Okay.
Oliver11:06
Topic across the functions to validate or you know, at least internally to
rely on that.
Harry11:11
Okay.
Oliver11:12
Apart from that, DCN is kind of the, the biggest gap in the TSA costs and
there are a few line items, a few applications that need to be updated
across the board. But you know, 10, 10 applications.
Harry11:25
Okay.
Oliver11:28
Documented. Was. Was one that I haven't.
Harry11:30
Sure everybody's got. Okay.
Oliver11:32
Yeah, we do have TCO data for that and I put that in place of that at least
for now or if not to use until we get a new.
Harry11:40
It's on a tsa. Correct. We have our. Is it a build bank? It's a. It's a tsa=
.
Oliver11:46
It's a tsa.
Harry11:47
Okay. So we should have run. Well, we have run costs. You could put it on
the T. We have.
Oliver11:52
So from sewage. We have the TCO and I have the license and the support cost=
.
Harry11:56
Okay.
Oliver11:56
And so I think we're okay to.
Harry11:57
Go with that and document them. Is a. It's probably cloud storage. I don't
know if it's on prem.
Oliver12:02
Okay.
Harry12:03
It's on prem. We may need to understand server cost as well. We can talk to
Gary Hamby on documenting. We could have you talked to him?
Oliver12:13
Yeah, several times and he's been. He's ghost me like five, five, five
calls with him and he says he'll. He commits every time. Just giving it to
me in a day.
Harry12:23
Okay, then let's set up a call.
Oliver12:25
Do we have an escalation mechanism on.
Harry12:27
Stuff like that though, like Paul and Pierce. But have we.
Oliver12:29
Do we have a running list of what we need from them?
Harry12:31
We should get this. Let's create a list and then we'll go chase this.
Oliver12:34
I have a call set up with them tomorrow.
Harry12:36
But let's, let's capture. Let's capture the 20 things that are still
pending and let's, you know, bring it up to Pierce and you know, Sukai as
well.
Oliver12:46
Just document it. Make sure like, because they may not do it. You need an
email showing that you sent it to them. Okay. And that we. We do have that
for. For the TSA costing exercise. Okay. Emails and follow ups.
Harry12:58
All right, so let's walk through. Okay, let's quickly go to standalone then
let's walk through the models. What we have standalone. Similar, same
people, similar.
Oliver13:06
But more data is missing. So the team's focused on TSA data first. Many of
them have not gotten back to me. The biggest gaps are with. With Gary and
with engineering. There's at least 22 applications there that we don't have
data on.
Harry13:22
Have you reached out to Dora Cecily?
Oliver13:26
She's been part of some conversations. Yes.
Harry13:28
Can you reach out to her? She's very responsive in India. But reach out to
her for the total cost.
Oliver13:41
There are some like supply chain that we've talked about where we supply
chains.
Harry13:46
Typically very good.
Oliver13:47
They are. But what's his name, Go has said that they provided the
information. Yeah, yeah, but it's not. It's not. So there's 14 applications
there. There's not a cost for everyone. There's not. It's not broken down
by service.
Harry14:04
Okay, so let's set up a call with Gokul and he did say if you have
questions, come back. So let's get the data from what we have from you, put
it on a table and say this doesn't fit with what we need. And let's set up
a call with Gokul Friday morning, India time. Well, India time. So either
tomorrow night, late night, eight, nine, central, or like, you know, Friday
morning.
Oliver14:30
Yeah.
Harry14:30
All right. Seven, eight, Central. I don't know, whatever we can find. A
crapload of meetings.
Oliver14:38
Okay.
Harry14:42
Sorry. Just a general say by Friday, I want to be able to give Sukai a full
list of this and saying, here's the overall. These particularly are the
apps we're missing. Because I'm missing this. This I want to be able to put
on the table and say sukai for these. This is what I'm missing. This is
where I need your help because we have to close it by the 13th and run
through. All right. Okay.
Oliver15:04
We'll have that by Friday for sure.
Harry15:06
Okay.
Oliver15:06
We have a good sense of what that is now.
Harry15:08
Okay. All right, so let's step into the models.
Oliver15:11
Sure. So for TSA costing, there's a few gaps here with data intelligence.
We've already talked about that.
Harry15:26
You don't have any of the common. Okay. Data and intelligence. You have no
data.
Oliver15:30
We have. We have five, six of the 11, but they're at a Honeywell level and
not.
Harry15:37
So can you add them in there and make a commentary on. Let's assume 10%
consumption. So I want some basic commentary on the right hand side. But
then pull in the number here and say, you know, 10%. We're allocating 10%
based on initial estimate.
Oliver15:56
Yeah.
Harry15:56
To be refined by IMAT.
Oliver15:59
Right.
Harry16:00
So put some numbers like that.
Oliver16:01
The one follow up. The problem I have with that is that is. What's this?
Rajesh is common here that we followed up. I asked him about a couple
times. As he says, considering the Honeywell license is utilized during the
TSA period, there's zero license cost. Which is not correct.
Harry16:21
No.
Oliver16:22
And so he has, he has some support costs in here at a Honeywell level that
we can do that to 10% of that. But we don't have a license cost because he
says zero which is not the case. So I followed up with him on that. He
hasn't gotten back.
Harry16:35
So.
Oliver16:35
Okay, that's still a gap on getting.
Harry16:37
Intelligence thing just do on teams. Okay. I get this email follow ups as
well. But copy me and him on that and let's, let's set up a call and talk
to him or Ravi.
Oliver16:48
Okay.
Harry16:49
On this. All right. So I keep saying this.
Oliver16:51
Of course.
Harry16:53
How about Robbie?
Oliver16:54
Robbie. I'll check the schedule.
Harry16:56
Okay. Like hit every one of those guys. Not just. All right. Okay, so let's
go back into the costing.
Oliver17:10
Okay so yeah, data intelligence. We'll follow up on that one. Get that line
item in there. Cloud.
Harry17:18
Nothing there.
Oliver17:19
Nothing there. We have cost. These are the.
Harry17:22
So let's go through the list. Erp. What do you have for ERP and how did you
get that your. Your license cost is. What is this annual Monthly.
Oliver17:33
Yeah. So this is based on what actuals are the same estimate that we used
for last month or last for day three.
Harry17:40
Okay.
Oliver17:43
And so it's a 400k monthly cost and we're putting it in as a six month
duration. So 2.4 total.
Harry17:58
No, so it won't be six months. It is probably going to be nine to 12
months. Okay, nine months but at least monthly is fine. I wouldn't put
total monthly cost is. Yeah, that's ERP is probably nine months.
Oliver18:11
Okay.
Harry18:12
Okay. Non ERP is finance HSE legal. Okay, so you've got.
Oliver18:20
Yeah.
Harry18:21
So you got the numbers?
Oliver18:23
Yep.
Harry18:24
Is that complete? Complete.
Oliver18:26
We are for. For tsa. It's pending one application from Finance Auto bank
which was marked as a. Incorrectly marked as a retire.
Harry18:39
Like Harry is getting away with murder saying things have been incorrectly
added on. Like he just keeps adding on to the TSA list.
Oliver18:46
Yeah.
Harry18:47
Okay. We have to like this is other thing that he has a habit of. Just
because he spoke to Aaron and gave stuff to Aaron doesn't mean
automatically appears on a C on a TSA list. It has to go through the whole
change control and get approved.
Oliver19:03
So I don't think that was on there either though. This is, this was in
retire the whole time. So.
Harry19:11
Okay, all right, understood. But okay. At this point there is no governance
and change control because if he wants to keep adding stuff on there and he
thinks it's on a tsa then.
Oliver19:25
Okay.
Harry19:26
Separate, different issue to tackle. Ccx.
Oliver19:31
Yeah, we have just about everything there. There's a couple apps that they
provided that are not in our list, so I need to validate those, but they
provided all their applications.
Harry19:42
Can you, can you do me a favor and add the numbers here for each of these
Finance hse? Yeah, you have a net number here. But I want to, I want to
split up. I want to try and get a view of what's fixed, what's variable.
Oliver19:59
Yeah. And so.
Harry20:00
Okay, you could do that as a homework.
Oliver20:01
Yeah.
Harry20:02
Okay, let's go back there.
Oliver20:06
Okay. Yeah. So ccx. What's.
Harry20:09
What about is. Okay.
Oliver20:10
CCX should be about complete. It's pending to app validation.
Harry20:15
Okay. And is there no infrastructure and hosting costs? Is there no network
costs? Where's the network? Is the network cost under DCN or somewhere else=
?
Oliver20:28
Yeah.
Harry20:29
So that's servers. Correct. Is there any network like circuits that they
have to pay for? Like all of these? Is that all in here?
Oliver20:38
That's a pending question I have for network and compute. I mean, I think I
was talking with Arpit this morning. He said storage as well. And maybe I
don't understand that in database, what the difference is.
Harry20:56
Okay, let's get. Because. Yes, network and circuits for the, for this. If
they're paying 200k to Verizon for this data center, then we paid. Right.
There's compute, there's storage, where they're going. Okay, I have 50
servers. The cost of these racks is this much for storage. And then on top
of that, they'll pay for the consumption of the services. So we'll need
that number because some of those are variable, some of those are fixed.
