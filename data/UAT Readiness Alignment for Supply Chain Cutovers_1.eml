Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 10, 2025Attendees and Context

   - Attended by IT Workstream leads, business and supply chain
   stakeholders (including representatives from ERP, CCEX, Data Analytics,
   Supply Chain IT, Security, Planning, Logistics, Procurement, Operations,
   and factory/site-level teams).
   - Noted contributors: Rakesh (facilitator), Sriram, Srinivas, Bill,
   Stephen, Brian, Chase, Pramod, Jerry, and others.
   - Purpose: Detailed working and alignment session on User Acceptance
   Testing (UAT) readiness, particularly for supply chain functions as part=
 of
   major systems transformation (BRV, UAT, and Day 1 cutovers =E2=80=93 inc=
luding 8.1
   and 11.1 releases). Several references to previous UAT kickoff sessions
   (April-May 2025).

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *Session Objectives and Background*

   - Alignment between IT and business functions for UAT readiness.
   - Effort to confirm scope, systems impacted, owners, test periods, and
   specific test requirements/system dispositions (e.g., Build Back, Move
   As-Is, TSA).
   - Context: 300+ systems in total, with a short-listed 40 systems
   identified as critical for supply chain ("ISC") scope.

2. *System Inventory Review*

   - Presentation and walkthrough of an Excel/table detailing the critical
   systems for ISC impacted by BRV/UAT.
   - Each system entry includes: System name, IT workstream lead, Business
   UAT lead, type of testing required, and disposition.
   - Discussion of methodology: Process owners in Logistics, CX,
   Procurement, Planning contributed top critical systems. Major focus on
   systems requiring =E2=80=9Cfull UAT=E2=80=9D versus =E2=80=9Caccess vali=
dation only.=E2=80=9D
   - Clarification and review requested from functional and IT leads:
   Verification of accuracy, duplicates, missing systems, and responsible
   contacts.
   - Agreed process for edits: Suggestions and additions (e.g., from site
   users like Chase) to be relayed and incorporated.

3. *System Dispositions and Testing Scope*

   - =E2=80=9CColumn F=E2=80=9D is critical: Determines whether =E2=80=9Cfu=
ll UAT=E2=80=9D versus minimal
   validation needed.
   - Discussion about two =E2=80=9CCollections=E2=80=9D line items and clar=
ification of
   scope (process- versus system-based).
   - Addressed system-specific nuances: (e.g., Banking Portals, HighRadius,
   JIRA usage in collections/reconciliation).
   - Challenges with tool ownership across categories (ERP vs. Planning
   tools, such as Optavision).
   - Need to confirm disposition and testing approach for legacy and Day 1
   portals (e.g., SUS Portal, Ariba) and clarify integration touchpoints
   (Optavision, APO, etc.).
   - Emphasis: Each system to be validated with current owners and business
   leads.

4. *Business and Test Window Availability*

   - Key dates:
      - UAT window proposed: July 7=E2=80=9311, 2025.
      - Reference to other test and close windows: June 23=E2=80=9330, 2025=
.
   - Need for clarity on business testers=E2=80=99 availability during thes=
e
   periods, particularly by process (AP, Collections, Credit Mgmt, Order Mg=
mt,
   etc.).
   - Decision: Each UAT sub-function lead will confirm business user
   availability. Direct offline follow-ups encouraged between IT and busine=
ss
   contacts.

5. *Gaps and Follow-Up Items Identified*

   - Review uncovered possible missing/duplicate systems in the inventory
   sheet.
   - Notable missing site-level or operational systems, especially as
   flagged by site leads (e.g., Chase, Brian). Action required to ensure
   completeness.
   - Clarification needed for systems such as MES, and those integrated
   with factory ERPs (e.g., SAP MES integration for specific plants).
   - Process for functional and site teams to review and flag any
   missing/incorrect system entries.
   - Discussion around need for a column to distinguish BRV (8.1 go-live)
   scope versus 10/27 (Day 1) go-live scope.

6. *Testing Logistics and Environment Readiness*

   - Review of test environments (e.g., CIQ, CIX) and their refresh cycles.
   - Noted that integration between environments (e.g., CIP 900 and CAP
   900) may not fully simulate production; workarounds expected for end-to-=
end
   testing.
   - Data readiness: Recent refreshes of test environments from production
   ensure accuracy.
   - Automated test script development: ERP team targeting mid-June
   completion of automated scripts to be circulated among business teams fo=
r
   review.

7. *Test Scenarios, Scripts, and Roles*

   - Different workstreams at various stages of translating scenarios into
   test scripts.
   - ERP: Automated test scripts being developed, aiming for efficiency and
   scenario coverage.
   - Coordination required for script validation between IT and business,
   as well as appropriate sign-offs.
   - Discussion of tool usage, logistics for loading scripts, and role
   assignments (validation, sign-off, etc.).

8. *Third Party, TSA, and Day 1 Systems*

   - Clarity sought on treatment of TSAs =E2=80=93 majority not requiring i=
n-depth
   testing unless there=E2=80=99s minor configuration change; some minor va=
lidation
   (SSO, access/logical separation) still needed.
   - Specific examples: Ariba, Windshuttle, IBM Sterling (EDI),
   Hybris/Magento/Salesforce (CX platforms) =E2=80=93 most unchanged; minim=
al =E2=80=9Csmoke
   testing=E2=80=9D requested.
   - Follow-up for site/factory-level applications tightly integrated but
   remaining =E2=80=9Cas-is=E2=80=9D for Day 1.

9. *Environment, Access, and Security*

   - Security team to support provisioning of access for testers (including
   remote, device, connectivity needs).
   - Business UAT leads and IT workstream leads to coordinate on user
   access, necessary changes, and device setups as needed.

10. *Open Questions and Site-Level Concerns*

   - Raised by Brian/Chase: Concern that not all operationally critical
   applications are reflected; need for granular site-level system validati=
on.
   - Stephen flagged importance of manufacturing IT teams=E2=80=99 involvem=
ent for
   completeness (e.g., Gary Hamby, Joe Ryan).
   - Agreement to rebuild/review system inventories in collaboration with
   site teams, reconciling November=E2=80=93December initial inventories wi=
th current
   state.

11. *Additional Technical and Integration Considerations*

   - Noted system-specific exceptions where integrations aren=E2=80=99t ava=
ilable
   in the QA environment.
   - Will need to build temporary integrations or plan workarounds for
   comprehensive UAT.

12. *Miscellaneous and Admin Points*

   - Clarified tool-specific questions (e.g., SSO validation, license
   renewals for Windshuttle), with several system-level side discussions to=
 be
   handled offline.
   - Email address changes (e.g., for Salesforce vendor IDs):
   System-generated addresses available, but mailboxes not yet created; to =
be
   clarified and followed-up separately.

Rakesh0:07
Share the or share the screen. Yep, sharing. I'll kick things off. Hey,
good morning. Good evening, team. Hi, Rakesh. Good morning again, everyone.
Good morning everyone. Morning. Shreem us. Thanks for making it. You are.
You're one of the most important people on this call. So. And sri. Too many
conflicting. I. Yeah, yeah. But no, thank you for making the time for it.
Yeah, absolutely. SRI and Srinivas and all the active leads actually,
Stephen and others. This is fantastic. So. Yep. Bill, thank you. This is
going to make us have a really good conversation with the supply chain
stakeholders, with ISC stakeholders. So thank you very, very much for
making time. Rakesh, could you record the session or is it not. No, I do
have copilot on so I'm going to bear with me while it turns off everybody's
audio and camera for a second. I think recording should be on. Great, thank
you. Appreciate it. And I want to make sure it is a case can. I didn't get
a note. I know it muted me, but I want to make sure that it is. Cisco Pilot
is in use. So I think we're okay. Perfect. All right, so we'll give it one
more minute and then we'll get started here. So. And I'll let people in
here. So quite a few more others joining in. So. All right, I think we can
get started. We do have very good participation. So again, thank you all so
much for making the time for this. This is quite, quite important, critical
that you are all here and supporting us. So I want this very much to be an
alignment session, working session with the function. So what we've done
over the past couple of weeks is if you recall, many of you were or some of
you were in the UAT kickoff sessions back in late April and May. And we
started working towards aligning all of the IT work streams with the
functions in terms of UAT readiness. So what we wanted to do here, and
we've been working again in this case with Sriram and the EISC function,
we're similarly doing something with Will and the finance function and, and
the HR function as well. So what we want to do starting with this is have a
series of conversations with all of the stakeholders involved in the
systems, both from a systems and process perspective with a supply chain
function. So if you'll go to the next slide, Mac. So again, very much a
working session. What we've done over the past week or so is work with
Sriram and the team to identify all of the systems that are getting touched
by supply chain as part of this BRB and uat. Now, from a purely systems
perspective, there is a slew of systems that are, you know, build back,
move as is, et cetera, that have those dispositions that are getting
touched. But in addition to that, for the end to end supply chain
processes, there are quite a few systems that are impacted either, you
know, information flowing or needs needs testing in an environment. So the
idea here is that we've got a table, we've asked Canvas for some feedback
from the work streams, workstream leads and yourselves. So what we want to
do is review those systems and make sure that we've got those lined up as,
you know, either BRV or BRV adjacent and make sure that we've got the right
function or the work stream supporting it. We've got the right testers and
owners of those systems identified. So I think this is where we'd be
looking for the workstream leads to help identify some of that here. We
also want to talk through some of the test windows and test periods that
we've identified. I know there's very much a draft here, but several of you
sent back your SID and UAT dates. At least for the UAT dates. We want to
make sure that we're lining that up with some of the test periods that
Sriram and the team are looking at as, as, as they go through the process.
I added on here the entry exit criteria perhaps a bit, you know, again it's
a, it's a starting point here. Want you all to take a look at that and
perhaps that may need a little bit more work or alignment individually to
understand with the test leads and the function leads what the entry exit
criteria is. As you come out of and get into and come out of uat. In the
sign off there is a roles and responsibilities matrix that we flashed up in
one of the kickoffs. I do want to bring that back up again to talk through,
you know, as we talk through, you know, the tool to use, who's going to
load the scripts, who's going to sign off and who's going to validate, etc.
So we just want to talk through that. The other piece of this is really
talk through the test scenarios and approach where we are across several
functions and work streams is there are test scenarios that have been
developed. I think different work streams are in different phases of
validating that the test scenarios have been translated to test scripts.
We'll talk through some of the logistics on, you know, what tools are we
using. I know the ERP team, Srinivas Sri, Jab ET Cetera SRI Bill, you know,
you've already started conversations on how do you automate these scripts,
what tools do you use, etc. So I want to make sure that we have a holistic
conversation and talk through precisely that, that we align on what are the
tools, you know, what are the logistics around it. I know there was some
virtual windows and some physical, you know, couple of windows, one
virtual, one physical. You know, we also have the security team here just
to provide us, you know, as we look at logins, as we look at user Access,
testers access, etc. Do we need devices, you know, what sort of
connectivity is there, remote testing involved, etc. So they'll able to
align or at least loop in and take some action items for us if needed to
make sure that the right users get the right access to enable the testing.
So I said quite a lot there. I do want this to very much be a working
session, you know, particularly the, we've got the erp, the ccex, the data
analytics teams in here and the supply chain IT teams. So I do want us to
talk through that. You know, those are the key work streams, functions, if
you will, that impact supply chain. So before we get started into working
session and talking through the systems. Sriram, any other comments or
outcomes you would like from this conversation? No. First of all, thank you
Rakesh for setting this up. Team this up. This was an important meeting
from a supply chain stakeholder perspective. So there are a lot of
functions that are on this call from the business side as well as from the
supply chain functions across planning, CX logistics and procurement and
operations. So there, there are, so I want to give us some time for Q and
A. Maybe we can do it during these individual agenda items which, which I
think is. Okay, right, like. Or you want to reserve questions for the late.
No, no, no, let's keep the questions coming. We'll answer them, we'll take
notes, but very much a working session. Perfect. Okay. All right, so if you
go to the next slide and this is going to be a busy slide and so we'll
start using your Excel for this. Again, sore for the eyes but what this is
and we'll pull up the sheet and walk through this. So let me do that here.
Or would you prefer to do that? Sriram? No, go ahead. All right. As you
said, this is a, this is an important view that I personally wanted to
ensure to define the scope of what systems are critically important for
isc. And so the way we develop this, there are, by the way there start off
with we have 300 plus systems and so there was no way that we have time to
go and test all of those systems. So the teams went back and did a touch
point on what are the systems that are extremely critical for us to ensure
that we are ready for 8.1 or 11.1, depending on the system. And each of the
process owners from Logistics, cx, procurement and planning came back with
a short list of say five to 10 systems each. And this is a list of about 40
systems that have various dispositions, Buildpack, Movasis, mostly TSA that
we have organized here. And the intent is to ensure everybody has common
understanding of what are those systems a which IT work streams and the PMs
are leading the effort. From an IT perspective, who are the business UAT
leads? And really I think one thing that we're like you see column F is
very, very critical because there are some systems that we don't really
need to do a whole lot of full testing. It's just a question of ensuring
that the users have access and that the systems are cut over because there
is really no development that is significantly worthy to go full uat. But
there are several systems that we do need to do a full uat. And so we want
to understand what those systems are and ensure that we have a proper test
plan for that. So that's why I set up this System and with EY's help and
with the IT Workstream leads help, we're trying to fill this out so we all
have the same understanding of what we're testing for and to what extent
we're testing these systems for. That's the intent of this file. Great,
thanks Sriram. Now if some of you already have this information and I'm
looking at you, Bill and Srinivas, you know some of this, you may already
have all this information. If so, you know, we can certainly send you the
link and have you have you fill that as well. But I think the idea is to
walk through this and make sure that, you know, these are the systems that
are getting touched as part of, you know, Sriram's and functional scope,
ISE's functional scope. So if there's anything else that you think, think
from our perspective, from an IT perspective, the systems should be
included here. You know, let's have that conversation as well. So Rakesh, I
have two questions. Number one, before this call, I think we had a internal
IT connect where we were talking about the business availability for the
upcoming uat. Right? Okay. And then when the closest, the close, I
understand is starts I think the week of the 23rd of June and then probably
it should close by 30th. Right. Then when the business will be available
for the UAT that is number one. And then the window that we are looking
currently, 7th to 11th, July 7th to 11th. Right. Again it depends based on
list of scenarios scope that one used one want to execute for each of these
processes. Right. Number two, why do we have collections twice on your
spreadsheet one it says and then there is one banking port which I
understand that's the cash app collections. So what is those two different
collections here? What is the scope of those two collections here? Yep, so
we can talk through those. So the first thing first. Yes. So Your point on
July 7th to 11th? I think so the action item here is to understand business
availability, to be able to support that. So I think Shriram, that's
probably a takeaway. Either we can address it here or have that as a
takeaway to come back and validate business availability. Now shreem, are
you looking for any specifics on that or is that more of a. And by that I
mean, you know, do we need business availability across certain regions,
across certain locations. When I say business availability across the
process. Right. Processes could be someone involving with AP or it could be
someone from the collections disputes, credit management or anyone who will
be engaged from order management from again this explicitly for business.
Right, right. So what is their availability today when the users will be
available? I think that is key. Right. For me to have my test scripts
ready. I'll have to go back and work with the business because list of
scenarios needs to be documented what they want me to cover in the testing
the scope. Therefore I wanted to understand their availability. Based on
that we can come up is like one week window is enough or two weeks window
of your interview business. Yeah, got it. I mean I think it's a good, good
question Srinivas. I think that's why in column G we have identified the
business UAT for that specific sub function lead. For CX it would be Mihala
Preeta and then for collections it'd be Unis. You can come to me overall
from an ISE point of view and I'll be happy to set some time to go and get
those details and the answer can be different for each function. So. So
let's take that offline. The contact names are given here for that reason
specifically so that the IT team and the business team can talk to each
other and ensure that your test scenarios are aligned and the owners of
actual Testers and the timeline is all aligned. Right. So I think we can do
that. Not in this meeting, but I'm happy to have additional conversations
offline with you. Okay. Okay. And for everyone's benefit. And some of you
may not have access to the ITAthens folder, but if you do, at least the IT
team will. Srinivasan team. I've posted this particular file. I'm sharing
in there for your reference. Now, the second question you asked about the
systems. So this was a. These were the systems identified and we went back
and looked at this as master app inventory. So that what you see in column
A are the systems that Sriram and the team and the functions have
identified as impacted by their scope of testing. So if there's something
that is either a duplicate or needs validation or rectifying here, we can
certainly do that and clarify if there are certain things that are wrongly
called out here or if it's a wrong system in your. In your opinion, then we
can certainly modify it here and correct it if there's something missing as
well. We can do that. So you were talking about, you said Jira on top.
Correct for collections. Yeah, I know that's more of a process where they
use Zira corrections, but then we have one more. So here is where we create
a work list for the. The collection specialist to go test based on company
or based on what they wanted us to cover in that. In that. So just wanted
to double check the expectation for those two line items. That's the reason
why I asked you that question. Fair enough. And I think Harry, you're on as
well. So. So I know we said Banking Portals is not just one nice little
app, it's perhaps a series of them. Correct. I'll get that clarified with
Eunice. On what? All portals are included in there. Take an action there.
This is a collection. So I believe that they need to validate the bank
statement ally as well as the system like hrc. So Units Hurricane is really
managing the hrc. You know, that's another app. Let me cover here. It's not
just for the portal itself. So. Sorry, what was that? What was that? Okay,
so this is high radius. Okay. Yeah. Okay, let me make a comment here. That.
Yeah, so this is not a specific specific. It's access to bank portal as is.
Got it. Okay. And I think you mentioned hrc. Right. So that's from Harry.
And then the other part here we mentioned, and I know I pulled in Gary in
here. So this is really more of a process. So maybe we need to have A
follow up here as well with Eunice on now to your point, Srinivasi said the
requirement for the use of this. Yes. All right. I think. I think that one,
if I remember correctly maybe somebody from the CX organization might be
able to back me up here. But I. I think if customers end up paying to the
wrong company, they would have. The collections team would have to make an
entry in JIRA for the reconciliation process. So. And then the. The monies
would then be flowing to the correct entity after the approval via jira.
That is my recollection of what unis needs that for, but I can confirm that
there are that or other applications as well. Okay. I think this is more of
a. My understanding is the JIRA is more of a tracking right. For any
request that they want to get reviewed or approved. So yeah, probably to
get it clarified between Srira. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Now sh. We do have a few
other ERP apps. I think there were a couple that got thrown over to you
from when we spoke with Goku in Pramod from a couple of days ago. I believe
Optivision. Do you want to. Do you mind. Sorry for the interruption. Do you
want to filter out specific? We certainly can. Okay, let's do this. Let's
make sure again these are the right ones. So sus portal was a lib without
and we note that as a dcom we need to understand what is in scope or what
would replace it in the scope of this testing. So whether it's even in
scope to be tested. Would you or Bill have a view on that? I'm not aware
about this app, Bill. You know I suggest let's. Let's circle back serum on
this. I might touch base on this if I recollect correctly. It was agreed
that only it is not needed for solidus because of the volume and the other
details that we have. Additionally using the apo, I think we share the
forecast with the BW portal, with the BICs, with our vendors or suppliers.
That could be another reason why why it was not suggested. But then let's
circle back to close this gap. Okay. So can you just kill a call with you
me and Siram include Jesus on that please? Yeah. These are business from
procurement point of view. Okay, perfect. And promotion this one. This
might need to be used from soft spin is to hard spin. So for readiness we
will need to make sure that this continue to work until we get the final
migration to Ariba and EDI other portals. But overall it will be the
commission for the hard spin. Yes, fair enough. Good point you're making
because this is a day one disposition of a dcom for day one. But yeah, or
live without for day one. So at soft spin then you're. You're. You're spot
on. But if it's still live, then there might be some testing or some. Some
requirement there. Okay. So I've taken it as a follow up. Optavision is the
other one. Optivision. If I understand correctly. This should be with
Engineering. Okay, but Zariba is with the erp, right? I mean that's what we
already categorized. Which one you're talking Goku. We were talking about
Ariba before Ariba. No, no, we will come back. No, yeah, yeah, let's get to
that. Optivision. So we see Engineering. Okay, I'm just gonna make a note
here. Is. Is Optavision not the. The planning tool used in Huntsville?
Yeah, it is. That's what I was going to say. It's their erp. Yeah, it's
there. Okay. It's erp. Oh okay. Yeah. So let me make sure then. So, so, so
when we say it's erp. But. But here. There's a team here in erp. Yeah,
yeah. But the thing about it is they use it for, for advanced planning.
They use it like for apo. They don't really use apo. They use Optavision
and then put the data into APO from Optavision. There's an integration.
There's an integration between Optavision and CAP 900. I get it. I think
what I meant was the IT work stream that is involved with Athens migration
of these systems. Right. So it's an ERP work stream led by SRI and Bill.
Right. Like I want to make. Make sure that they discussed this one
Optivision long time back when we are dispositioning all our applications
and this is a planning tool. So I don't. That's the reason why I think this
did not come up to erp. Let me understand. JD you say when it's planning
tool what is. We do out of. We did the advanced planning. It is all that.
The planning. The optimization is planning for possible plan. Basically how
the to. How do they plan all the roles and all the different variant
configuration materials from Optimism from Optavision and then that data
will be transferred back to SAP. Yeah. So what is the disposition? SRI is
it move as is. I would imagine optimization is more as is. Yes. And who.
Who owns it SRI today? No, that is. Yeah, that's what I'm so wondering
right now. That is that is categorized and under planning applications no,
it's not planning. Okay. I mean, at least from the service category on your
perspective, I know this is not. But then, Jerry, let's connect. It might
be treated as a planning tool, but it might be a scheduling tool. Let's
understand that. Let's have a meeting with Jerry and we will walk through
this. Okay, perfect. This is the exact benefit of this meeting. I just
wanted to make sure. Yeah. So you need to understand, I mean, why it's
falling under planning and cmd. It is not. It is not under planning for
sure. Same as the support last one, right? The previous one that you
mentioned. Yeah, yeah. Different stakeholders in terms of the meeting. So
Jerry, thank you. Appreciate it. Basically to reconfirm that with the
stakeholders to align this template. Right? Yeah, yeah. Even if it is live
without. We need to make sure if those are aligned with relevant. Take a
look. Yeah, thank you. So we've got a couple here. So apo. Yep. Yeah, put
it in the chat. I mean, we're working with Burna on that. We're not working
with Bill on the apo. Yeah, that's correct. So it is. There it is. Right.
Okay. So. So it's not Bill. Who is it? I put it in Bill. Bill is the pm.
Is. Right. Okay. All right. It may be somebody as a POC you're working
with. So we'll poor. Okay. Ariba. Ariba is. No, it's. Ariba is the rpr.
That's right. Okay, so SRI and Bill, as you go through this, I. I would
like maybe after this meeting would like your input on the testing
requirement call column. Right. Something as simple as full UAT or basic
testing. What is the extent of it testing that we need to do with business
on. On each of these apps. Okay. Ariba. I don't know. Again, let me check
with hi moms for me. A lot of surprises today's call. Basically, so I don't
know why. Bill, did you hear anything on Ariba coming to your feet? It's
not coming sri. We agreed this like four months back. One second. I'm
asking Bill, basically. Bill, you there? I am. Yeah. I don't know. It was
giving me some sort of warning every time I tried to come off mute. Yeah,
it must be the co pilot messing up. Apologize. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry. So
the question was, are we going to be testing Ariba? Yeah, that's what the
question is. Right. I mean it was not in our full end to end testing scope.
No. Right. That's what I'm saying. It's a tsa, right? Which means we're not
changing or just paying for the service. Correct. So for TSAs, do you need
any testing at this point? In one or two exceptions we're finding that is
the case. But on the whole, no. Right. So one of the ISE applications, even
though it's tsa, there are some minor changes that are being done September
wise which is forcing us to do a uat. User asset control should be that in
place. But we need to make sure if this particular instance is dedicatedly
for am. If so no testing of course not going to be. But then you still need
to validate the logical separation and you still need to validate the sso.
So there will be some still minor U. But then it's needed. That's my,
that's my suggestion. User control to be done for sure. As you mentioned.
Yes. The sso, they have to validate. Correct. So yeah, I mean there's no
lot of testing. But then the testing needs to be done. So. Brian Davis. Go
ahead. Brian, are you having difficulty unmuting as well? Yeah, somehow
when you unmute, if you're getting some messages. I'm also having the same
thing. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay. No, I'm. I'm the. For those who
don't know, I'm the systems lead for Spectra, so I kind of oversee. And
there's other people on the call. Jay over for Jason Boyd basically. And so
I'm looking at Spectra and pack out and chi and there's four. There's three
or four applications and LIMs. Our team, to my knowledge, we're at a loss
as to what is going on here, where testing is going to be done, what's the
extent of the testing. We need a. A reboot here for. For our local team to
get on the same page with what you are discussing. Okay. So we need to take
it offline to another call. But we're. Of course this seems to be at a very
high level and not at the point level. Yeah, I think Brian, the problem is
we need to align on the high level first before we encourage. Get to what
you're asking. Right. So like we need to agree what testing is required for
a given system and then we need to decide what plants we need to test it
at. Right. But they need to tell us. What I don't understand is what is
changing. Depending on what is changing will drive what we need to test.
That's what this meeting is about, Brian. But what I'm. What I'm saying is
I don't. I don't know what their what system? What are they changing in
this? We're, I'm assuming we're gonna have, we're gonna get access to a new
server and we're gonna test on I, I, I don't even know what the
connectivity is between all. Yeah Brian, no one's asking me to make
assumptions. So the team needs to come back with the scope of the change.
Yeah, I think it's clear that they owe you that. But you're asking us to
test in 13 days. No, I'm not. I'm not. That's why we asked for this meeting
Brian. Because we are not aligned as a leadership team on what needs to be
tested, who needs to be involved. Okay, so what we're trying to get at here
is to clarify just what you said. What is changing on these systems like,
for example, ERP, CIP 900, it's a TSA. Do we need what kind of testing do
we need? Because that's a pretty generic system. Right. It's everything. So
you know, we need someone on this team to come back to us and I guess what
trio I'm starting to drive at is what testing is needed and then we can
identify okay, these are the people that need to be involved. We're not
even close to that right now. Correct? That's right. We're building that so
that, that's. Thanks, thanks Jason for clarifying that. That's why it pms.
We need your help to fill that column F as soon as possible. Like today if
possible explain you know what level of testing we need. Okay. All right.
Chase. Chase. Hey. Hey guys. Also representing the Spectra business. It
seems that there's entire systems that are critical to day to day Spectra
business that are just not listed at all. What if we have situations like
that is the ask kind of for the users at the site level and the LOB level
to make sure that basically this is accurate. I guess a concern I have is
that there just maybe is some systems that aren't even included right now.
So I'm happy to take your input Chase. Like I think once you unfilter and
take a look at it, see if there are systems that you think are important
and not showing here. The whole funneled that to me and I'm happy to take
that back to the team and go look at it. But we've asked the functional
teams for what systems are critical. I'm not going to say this is foolproof
and 100% done. I think this is a good starting point and if there's edits
that need to be done to add more systems. Let's work and get that full list
done here. Got it. The other, the other thing is too. We need to understand
what needs to be tested for the 8.1go live and the 1027 go live because
there's two different lines. That's the other piece that needs to be. That
would help add clarity. That's a good point. Yeah, good point. We'll add
that column. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. No, very good discussion. Thank you. I
think these are relevant questions and as you can see it's, it's, you know
we're just working through it. So. But yes, so I think the other point you
made Stephen as well ERP quite generic but we know 8. 1 all the legal
entity changes happening in ERP. So Sri and Bill are all over that in terms
of the scope of testing etc. So again, you know, let us know there. Bill,
IBM, Sterling, Srinivasa, Sri, IBM Sterling is an EDI one and we need to do
that is already part of our. Our activities. Okay. And then you've got see
1. 1 comment. I assume that Christ is involved in that. Christina Delko But
I just wanted to. Yeah, he's involved in that. He's helping us to build
that. So. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, there was a couple of other ones. I mean
this one, see, this one's under planning. So it's. It's. I don't know the
difference between this one. But I again, Shiram, maybe you can help me
here. It's the same. It looks like it's the same ECC SIP 900 but it's a
separate line item. So. Yeah, ECC and BW are separate systems, but they're
all in. Okay. Okay. Itself is a one system. Right. One application. Right.
So. Right, right across the board. Yeah. All right. So okay. Wind Shuttle.
That just seems again from a CX tool. I think Prita. I think someone from.
I don't know anything. Erica is working with the contract renewal for
windshuttle. That is what the latest information. I got it. We are
extremely conceivably using in master Data management and cx. Yeah. But is
there any testing required for venture business? Nothing is changing for.
No, no, no testing. Testing is not required at all. Stream. Yeah. Because
that is just a renewal. Contract is just from the license standpoint.
That's a license, right. Not from the testing standpoint. No. Yeah, you are
right. There is no testing. Yeah, yeah. Because this is the standalone
tool. This is basically. They use this tool to automate all the master data
Activities to upload customer master to upload material master to make
changes to any other master data. So yeah, we can do a quick glance, but
nothing is changing over there. Okay, but we're keeping the access to the
same people that have the access. We're not changing anything regarding
that. Right. Licenses are the same. Will access need to change Right now
Erica is. Is controlling everything and she is part of this attendance team
and the. Sounds like moving. So she's already working as part of the
license renewal. Oh, how many. That's a separate topic, right? I don't want
to. Okay, okay. We have a separate topic. We have a separate communication
going on. This one. Yeah, the license renewal and all those things. License
itself is a separate topic all by itself. So I'm talking more accurate. So
yeah, a license all sorted out hopefully. But will access change to using
the tool? Everything is from CIP 900 only. Exactly. Yeah. All these things
are currently CIP 900. There is no different access AP 900. Understood.
Thank you. There were a couple of others on apo, BW and snp. These are also
on to the ERP team. So. Correct. That BW is not part of erp. That BW should
be part of ima. Okay. Yeah. Rajesh is probably not here, but then. Yeah, I
mean we are. We are Siri. We all are. All are reviewing that with Rajesh.
So he knows it. They're the one. They are. They are working through the
dispensation for it. Okay. One who are working through the reporting. The
report that we have. The planning organization uses the reports, the S
reports. So they are the ones who are who are working through that. Okay,
so it's not so Rajesh. G. Okay. Snp. I don't know. I mean it's again a
duplicate entry. I'm okay that if you want to have that. But then it's part
of the rule number 16 only. Oh, SEM. Yeah, yeah, it's. It's together we can
remove it. Yeah. Okay. So pramo, just one quick question over here because
obviously apo, you know, we have demand planning, we have snp. That is all
comes under APO only anyway. Right. So what is the plan? You guys will be
doing some testing and then they need to be an end to end testing from SAP
standpoint also. Correct. That's what it is. And it is only everything from
the IS system standpoint. It is part of the erp. EP is part of the ERP work
stream on the IT and Purna and my team as coordinating that putting the
efforts with the partners that we have in the project. Okay. And I just
want to call out that we got an integration between CIP 900 and CAP 900. So
we whatever changes in CIP 900, we got to make sure it can still talk to
the CAP 900. Correct. And that's the reason we have that under TSA. And
Jerry and Poorna are definitely coordinating it very well. Yeah. Okay. Got
it. Okay, cool. This is great. Thank you. Again, the action item. We'll
have the teams go back in here and populate what sort of testing or the
scope of testing required. Jerry, this is Kathryn Hart. I do want to
mention that in the test environment, CAP 900 and CIP 900 don't talk to
each other the way they do in the live environment. So testing is going to
be very difficult. We've got some work to do to make sure we can test that
integration. So you bring up a good point. Just a general question for the
team, and we may not solve it here, but are all of these in a QA
environment or test environment? Where is testing going to happen? Because
I think what I heard in prior conversations is there isn't necessarily a
neat little environment for testing for one or two of these. And we may
have to use sandbox environment for testing. So I want to make sure that.
That we have that in our minds as well as we go through this. Yes, testing
is required, but some of those, you know, the environment availability and
data availability is also something that we need to have in the back of our
minds as we discuss this. Yeah, yeah. Let me start from the ERP standpoint
and then I will get into the standard way, at least from our standpoint,
how we normally do this, setting these UAT sign offs. Right. So what we do
is from the ERP standpoint, we are planning to start our integration
testings. When I call integration testings. Whatever has been done,
everything is in cix, which is our sandbox. So we do validation in the
sandbox, making sure that everything is okay. Right. Including the forms,
the changes, the terms and conditions, whatever we are planning from that
workstream standpoint. So everything will be validated in CIX as part of
the integration testing. So the goal is basically use that. The whatever we
are discussing from July 7th to 11th is basically move everything to CAQ.
But the end to end testing need to be signed off in ciq because that is
where we take all our programs or whatever validated from Sandbox, move to
ciq, and then CIQ is the one that we have almost integrations, almost with
all the Systems in cix we may not have integrations with all the third
party systems, but Q is the key one. But end to end UAT sign off is the
ciq. Yeah, but CIQ APO will not push our planned orders to ecc. Yeah. From
APO standpoint, I think we need to see what, what needs to be done
basically because that is. That plays a different role. Yeah, those
connections will have to be set up because right now when we do one off
testing, we do a manual push between the two systems. But we'll need to
automate that so that we can simulate production. Yeah. How we need to
coordinate the testing activities for APO standpoint. Okay, so takeaway
here for those exceptions. So what I understood, if I translate you right,
SRI is it will be in ciq, the quality environment. That's where end to end
testing will happen and sign offs will happen by exception. We where that
is not the case, we will have to find the workarounds or the temporary
integrations to be built to complete that testing. Exactly. Because at the
end of the day when we do an end to end, somebody is signing off. That
means that all the flow has been validated. That's the reason why we need
to pick one system. If we do it in two places, I don't know when we move
back, I don't know whether behaving the same or anything has been changed.
Okay. Now in terms. Okay, so we'll document that and make sure. Now who's
following up on that? Is that you, SRI or your team that will have the
ownership on that as you work with each of the other ownership, obviously.
Right. As you know, we are the ERP ones and majority comes to ERP only at
some point. But we just definitely need, you know, I need to talk to Corona
for example if it is AP or. Right. You know. Yeah, but from our. We have
the ownership. Okay, got it. Perfect. How about data? What sort of data
needs to be seeded, where, et cetera? Again, not to get into the details of
it, but each of these scenario requirements. I presume you're already
having the conversations on the data requirements that need to be there.
Yeah, data from data standpoint. Again, CIQ is a recent refreshed of CIP in
the site. Yeah, ciq, CIX got refreshed sometime in CIQ got refreshed
sometime end of fifth and CIX got refreshed sometime in March, basically.
So it's almost like, like, almost like a fresh copy of a production date.
Okay, yeah, fresh copy of. So data standpoint, whatever we have it in cip
all the material master, customer, vendor or below materials, whatever it
from master data from pricing, whatever we have it in P that should be good
in Q. Okay so data standpoint. So at least what I am thinking if somebody
please correct me from maybe Prita from your standpoint or any from the ISC
standpoint that is you know CAQ is already is a fresh off CIP so I'm
assuming that should not be a problem. And from ERP standpoint what is
happening right now? Bill is working with the team to build automated test
scripts. Right. Getting all the different different scenarios. So what the
team is planning as soon as the scripts are available? Maybe. I'm not sure
Bill, it should be sometime mid next week that the plan is these test
scripts will be coordinated to Sriram and then you know that is the
starting validation point from us to give the basic scenarios. These are
the scenarios what we are planning to do if business wants to add anything
and they can let us know. We'll see whether. How can we automate so that we
can save time when we move to ciq? Yep, thank you. That's the way it's
gonna go. Sorry, just a quick one Rakesh. I know we have 15 minutes to go.
15 minutes. Yes. Several other topics to touch but Brian, I have a quick
question. Please go ahead. Yeah. So are we going to be using our. The
existing CIX 900 and CIQ 900. Yes. Okay. Yes, yes. So we are. We are still
doing development work right now in CIX and CIQ for current projects. When
is is that going to get turned off on before the 23rd pointing to a
different place or what development are you referring any specific project?
Yeah, we have our own project going on in Spectra they said was good
through July. Whatever we we told. Maybe I need to follow up on that. We.
We were asking all our teams whatever development projects that is
happening they need to wrap it up by June 27th. That is the last date they
have. We cannot take anything to July because of the cutover activities. We
need to lock all the. No new code should be done. Right. So maybe from
your. If you can send me the details I will check with. Is this anything
related to the toller portal? Yeah, it's between the portal and SAP. It's
Prashad. Prashad's leading it right now I guess. Yeah, I'll send you the
details but I thought you're going to start some testing on June 23rd,
right? No, no, no. Let's not confuse. Right. Whatever activities what is
happening June 23 is for project Athens basically. Right, so what Prasad is
working. That's not project items, that's a separate activity for Toller
Pro project. I will check with Prasad. When are they planning to move to
production so that we can coordinate. But the goal is whatever is the new
code should be done before end of June. Great, thank you for the question
and clarity. Appreciate it. Okay. All right, so going other work streams?
Yeah, let's do. And I know we've only got you know, 13 minutes so I do want
to circle back. So you know, lots of good conversations here, lots of
action items we're taking on. I think you know, we'll parking lot the entry
exit criteria and some of the, the access issues. But let's go through, you
know, we'll set up a follow up session for specific teams and I think
Stephen, I think you may be still on. I doubt there's very little on CCEX
here, here in terms of scope of testing. But can you opine on where we are
with, you know, what we may or may not need to do with hybris, magento,
sftc, alemica, etc. Yeah. Hey. Hi team. So for BRV, I don't think we've got
really anything that we, that we need to accommodate because all of these
applications are you know, TS8 right now. One question I wanted to ask the
team is we're already in ccex, we're already building out all of our test
scenarios, right. For user, for SIT and then uat. So you know, we're
looking at, you know, every application and you know, application testing
and then complete end to end testing and we are engaging with the business
to build those, you know, complete the complete inventory of test
scenarios, you know, as we, as we move forward over the next couple of
weeks. So is this over and above that, Rakesh? Because we are, you know,
we're kind of, we're kind of moving along that line as it stands, knowing
we'll have, you know, if you take Hybris as an example, obviously we've got
some changes in there that we're going to test. You know, a complete end to
end cycle. And for you that's a day one activity, correct? It's not a BRV
activity. Nice. Correct, yeah. So I think this one, in this case, this is
all the systems that as part of ISE are getting touched. So I think this to
if my understanding then Stephen would be like, so let's say Hybris,
there's no change in hybrids, it's a TSA on Day one. But you're working
towards a UAT for your day one. So for brv, you know, the scope of testing
may be minimal to none here. We may have to look at what the scope of
testing is for day one and sync up with Sriram on that. So we may need to
make that distinction. Correct. Somebody correct me if I'm. If I'm
mispeaking. I have a question. Okay, go ahead. So as far as we understood,
we understood that I think the same question Prita has because Ioana was
asking us from Salesforce. You want to stand for the email addresses. I
understand that we will need to have them with the Solstice domain in
Salesforce. And my understanding was that would that happen after or on the
1st of August or a bit after 1st of August. So would we need to test that
now? Very good point. What we've been told on the ERP side is that it's not
an eight. One deliverable. Right. I have heard the same thing that email
addresses is going to be post 8. 1. Yes. So my question here is Sri. My
question was like, like do we really need to test reframe and Magento and
Hybris perspective when they place an order from these platform? It does
because they're not changing anything other than email id and from 1st of
August nothing is changing. So do we really need to test that? No, no, no.
That's what it is. Right. We have some cases like we do not have any
changes but at least what suggesting, right. You know you need to get into
all detailed level of testing. But at least if you can run a phase scenario
just to make sure that everything is okay, that's what it is. Because this
is not a physical separation, right. You know nothing, nothing is
happening. Exactly. Everything remains the same. No. No network changes, no
IP changes. Everything remains the same. So you don't need to test anything
but at least for the purpose of like making sure that. Yeah, the flow is
there just to validate the flow. Maybe you can just run, run one simple
scenario and say that I'm good to go. Okay. So you can displace one order
from this. Who, who, who would do that? Simple test scenario. Is it a
business? We have to do CX business? Yeah. Okay. So three, do they need to
do the SSO testing? SSO is which one? This one is. You are talking about E
Commerce Portal only, right? Or a different one? No. Yes. Single sign on
will be part of the overall testing scenario. That's already in scope.
Yeah, single sign on is part of their scope. Yes, that's correct. In
Rakesh. I'm going to sort of challenge a couple of things on this sheet.
Right. Yeah, yeah. Because the EDI Elenica, that was MERT erp. Right. As a
solution as the service. That's most definitely. That was, that was a while
back. Okay. The RPA Automation should be ima. Okay. Right. And then I
actually think the gen. I'm not 100% sure what that application is
referencing to. I think we've got to check that. I was just looking at the
background that the, the master inventory sheet and there's you know,
there's several, several references to gen, you know, generically. So I
think we probably need to just look at that and see well, what exactly does
that mean? Because we don't, we've got sort of, you know. So I don't think
we need to test anything on the 1st of August there because ideally again
nothing is changing. What we're using Genai for is classifying cases that
are going through Salesforce. So it's hosted on Salesforce. So if testing
on Generic will have or on Salesforce starts in Morocco anyways in mid
August or something then that's when you test that as well. Now I still
have a question. I'm sorry Stephen, I see you have your hands up and I
jumped here. But still regarding emails, I will go back to that because
there are some emails coming from sales saying that from communications
with customers that they're in order to set up their vendor id which is a
very important thing for us in the Esso cut over and in everything that
we're going after the 1st of August they will need us to have the new
domain email addresses in some of the cases like the automotive customers.
So we will need to have the domain available on 1st of August. And I'm just
raising this here, I don't know if this is a possibility or not, but this
is what just raised today. Okay. No, thank you for bringing that to our
attention. Let me do a follow up. And, and Vince, not to put put you on the
spot here, from an, from an IAM perspective those emails would be
available. Correct. And in the system by 8.1. I don't know in the system
but certainly available prior to 8.1. Yes. So email addresses are available
now. That's Saurabh Khanna and the Dex Messaging team. It's not IAM but
understood are available. The mailboxes however have not been created yet.
Okay so all right, so email address is available. Mailbox is not created
yet. So we need to understand, perhaps dig dip. But maybe I will drop it
here and we can catch up offline so that we don't. So we, we don't block
the discussion on this now. Understood. I will record you. Yeah, the
request. Okay, so we'll have a. Yes. Stephen, just time's wrapping up. I
want to make sure we clarity on go forward to start getting some items
addressed here. Make sure we're working on that. Let's get organized going
forward. Understood. So again, quite a bit of work to do here. So I know we
wanted to talk through. If we go back to our, you know, let me go back to
the content we were sharing earlier. Right. So if we go back to our agenda
here. So test dates and windows, you know, we have a list here of the test
dates and windows that we've gotten from the teams. We will send that out.
We just write it. Yeah. Okay. Slide's a little slower then you're kind of.
Is that good? Are you able to see my screen now or no? No. Okay, give me
one second. Again. How about now? Yeah. Okay. All right. So again the first
item, I think we're making progress but we still need quite a bit of work.
So there's, there's a homework for everyone here to go back in and complete
that. And at least the column on, you know, the testing required, the test
dates and windows, we will send that out. This is what the teams have
published as the sit UAT dates. We'll send that out. Make sure that's again
a follow up conversation that's needed on aligning the windows and business
availability. So I think we have an action item there certainly, you know,
for ERP 23rd to 30th June and then 7 to 11th of July. So we'll have to
follow up on the business availability across processes, the entry exit
criteria. I think this is something we'll also send out. Please take a look
at that. And for particularly the folks that will be signing off and the
function leads, take a look and see what may or may not need to be adjusted
there. We didn't really get around too much. I know we have a few couple of
follow ups on test scripts. Automating of test scripts, finalizing the test
scripts and understanding. So there's quite a few follow ups. I think sri
you and the team. What I heard from was clearly the IT team will send what
test scripts they have, the business will validate and then add on top of
that or align with whatever the test scope scripts that the IT has. Right.
So I'm Waiting for SRI to send us what the starting point is. Likewise when
we'll take action. Yeah, as soon as they're available mid next week. That's
what we're targeting. Okay. And it's not just for erp and I want to make
sure EX and IMA and others are all doing the same thing. Yeah. So Stephen,
I think for you it may be a bit later because your UAT is and your plan
calls for that for a bit later than now. I don't think we have IMA
representation, Rajesh or anyone else in the sport. So that's a follow up
that will lead and then certainly promote. You've got that. And then the
next steps really in terms of. I don't think we ever discussed or you know,
discussed the tools, some of the logistics and some of the, the access
requirements. So that's a, that's a follow up. So perhaps that warrants a
subset of our team here to have that conversation on the logistics, etc. So
war will set that up as an, as a follow up as well. So I think those are
the things that I captured here notes and we'll certainly get the recording
out and the copilot notes out as well. Anything else I missed team?
Anything else you'd like to discuss here? Because we'll set up a follow up
session clearly lots of good things to discuss and align and finalize over
the next five, seven days. So certainly a follow up session warranted here.
But if there's anything else pertinent, the critical or anything I missed,
I missed here. Rakesh, one thing I want a question for Stephen really is
Stephen, we have connected with planning, procurement and logistics to get
the list of all the systems that are available for is. Right, like in the
scope but outside of this, are there any operationally from, from a
individual factory perspective or from a, like the systems that for example
Brian put out in the chat area, Chase put up in the chat here and Brian put
that in the chat. Now those, those things, are they aligned to operations
from your standpoint for the particular factories or is there, is there a
list that we have to compile from that viewpoint that may not be aligned to
the functions I mentioned before? Yeah, because we got some questions on
the MES that you connect into cip, but I didn't know how to approach that
answer. Have we not. Yeah, I'll connect you to that part of that. Have we
not engaged with the Gary Hamby's and the Joe Ryan's and I mean the
manufacturing IT folks on this because they have Pretty strong knowledge of
what you're talking about. We have and we haven't. Right. So it looks like
things that expanded we have to do like probably, I would say back up a bit
and walk through the work that has been done. Going to look at these apps.
A lot of these were, you know, brought up by the sites. We're going back to
like November, December time frame where a large list was populated and
then a lot of work was done to reconcile what needed the action. So I'm
kind of thinking we need to back up and maybe walk the ISC team through
that work. Why we're at where we are today. Okay, Stephen, so is there a
follow up with Gary Handy? We can set up that call? Because if a lot of
these are site apps and just move as is, there's nothing really necessarily
changing from a process perspective for brv. So it may be just that
alignment. But some of the things are integrated with erp, with SAP that
Chase was bringing up. So, you know, bandwidth is changing on SAP. You
always need to make sure the integration is not changing. But again, if you
guys can walk us through what is and is not changing with ERP SAP, so it
makes sense. That's a good call out, Jason. Thank you. We'll set that
follow up with the site specific apps and the integration with erp. Great.
Okay. No, thank you all very much. This is super helpful, useful. We'll set
up a follow up call and then send, send out the notes and action items.
Quite a few things coming out here. So again, thank you for your
participation. Thank you. Thanks guys.

 the screen. Yep, sharing. I&#39;ll kick things off. Hey, good morning. Goo=
d evening, team. Hi, Rakesh. Good morning again, everyone. Good morning eve=
ryone. Morning. Shreem us. Thanks for making it. You are. You&#39;re one of=
 the most important people on this call. So. And sri. Too many conflicting.=
 I. Yeah, yeah. But no, thank you for making the time for it. Yeah, absolut=
ely. SRI and Srinivas and all the active leads actually, Stephen and others=
. This is fantastic. So. Yep. Bill, thank you. This is going to make us hav=
e a really good conversation with the supply chain stakeholders, with ISC s=
takeholders. So thank you very, very much for making time. Rakesh, could yo=
u record the session or is it not. No, I do have copilot on so I&#39;m goin=
g to bear with me while it turns off everybody&#39;s audio and camera for a=
 second. I think recording should be on. Great, thank you. Appreciate it. A=
nd I want to make sure it is a case can. I didn&#39;t get a note. I know it=
 muted me, but I want to make sure that it is. Cisco Pilot is in use. So I =
think we&#39;re okay. Perfect. All right, so we&#39;ll give it one more min=
ute and then we&#39;ll get started here. So. And I&#39;ll let people in her=
e. So quite a few more others joining in. So. All right, I think we can get=
 started. We do have very good participation. So again, thank you all so mu=
ch for making the time for this. This is quite, quite important, critical t=
hat you are all here and supporting us. So I want this very much to be an a=
lignment session, working session with the function. So what we&#39;ve done=
 over the past couple of weeks is if you recall, many of you were or some o=
f you were in the UAT kickoff sessions back in late April and May. And we s=
tarted working towards aligning all of the IT work streams with the functio=
ns in terms of UAT readiness. So what we wanted to do here, and we&#39;ve b=
een working again in this case with Sriram and the EISC function, we&#39;re=
 similarly doing something with Will and the finance function and, and the =
HR function as well. So what we want to do starting with this is have a ser=
ies of conversations with all of the stakeholders involved in the systems, =
both from a systems and process perspective with a supply chain function. S=
o if you&#39;ll go to the next slide, Mac. So again, very much a working se=
ssion. What we&#39;ve done over the past week or so is work with Sriram and=
 the team to identify all of the systems that are getting touched by supply=
 chain as part of this BRB and uat. Now, from a purely systems perspective,=
 there is a slew of systems that are, you know, build back, move as is, et =
cetera, that have those dispositions that are getting touched. But in addit=
ion to that, for the end to end supply chain processes, there are quite a f=
ew systems that are impacted either, you know, information flowing or needs=
 needs testing in an environment. So the idea here is that we&#39;ve got a =
table, we&#39;ve asked Canvas for some feedback from the work streams, work=
stream leads and yourselves. So what we want to do is review those systems =
and make sure that we&#39;ve got those lined up as, you know, either BRV or=
 BRV adjacent and make sure that we&#39;ve got the right function or the wo=
rk stream supporting it. We&#39;ve got the right testers and owners of thos=
e systems identified. So I think this is where we&#39;d be looking for the =
workstream leads to help identify some of that here. We also want to talk t=
hrough some of the test windows and test periods that we&#39;ve identified.=
 I know there&#39;s very much a draft here, but several of you sent back yo=
ur SID and UAT dates. At least for the UAT dates. We want to make sure that=
 we&#39;re lining that up with some of the test periods that Sriram and the=
 team are looking at as, as, as they go through the process. I added on her=
e the entry exit criteria perhaps a bit, you know, again it&#39;s a, it&#39=
;s a starting point here. Want you all to take a look at that and perhaps t=
hat may need a little bit more work or alignment individually to understand=
 with the test leads and the function leads what the entry exit criteria is=
. As you come out of and get into and come out of uat. In the sign off ther=
e is a roles and responsibilities matrix that we flashed up in one of the k=
ickoffs. I do want to bring that back up again to talk through, you know, a=
s we talk through, you know, the tool to use, who&#39;s going to load the s=
cripts, who&#39;s going to sign off and who&#39;s going to validate, etc. S=
o we just want to talk through that. The other piece of this is really talk=
 through the test scenarios and approach where we are across several functi=
ons and work streams is there are test scenarios that have been developed. =
I think different work streams are in different phases of validating that t=
he test scenarios have been translated to test scripts. We&#39;ll talk thro=
ugh some of the logistics on, you know, what tools are we using. I know the=
 ERP team, Srinivas Sri, Jab ET Cetera SRI Bill, you know, you&#39;ve alrea=
dy started conversations on how do you automate these scripts, what tools d=
o you use, etc. So I want to make sure that we have a holistic conversation=
 and talk through precisely that, that we align on what are the tools, you =
know, what are the logistics around it. I know there was some virtual windo=
ws and some physical, you know, couple of windows, one virtual, one physica=
l. You know, we also have the security team here just to provide us, you kn=
ow, as we look at logins, as we look at user Access, testers access, etc. D=
o we need devices, you know, what sort of connectivity is there, remote tes=
ting involved, etc. So they&#39;ll able to align or at least loop in and ta=
ke some action items for us if needed to make sure that the right users get=
 the right access to enable the testing. So I said quite a lot there. I do =
want this to very much be a working session, you know, particularly the, we=
&#39;ve got the erp, the ccex, the data analytics teams in here and the sup=
ply chain IT teams. So I do want us to talk through that. You know, those a=
re the key work streams, functions, if you will, that impact supply chain. =
So before we get started into working session and talking through the syste=
ms. Sriram, any other comments or outcomes you would like from this convers=
ation? No. First of all, thank you Rakesh for setting this up. Team this up=
. This was an important meeting from a supply chain stakeholder perspective=
. So there are a lot of functions that are on this call from the business s=
ide as well as from the supply chain functions across planning, CX logistic=
s and procurement and operations. So there, there are, so I want to give us=
 some time for Q and A. Maybe we can do it during these individual agenda i=
tems which, which I think is. Okay, right, like. Or you want to reserve que=
stions for the late. No, no, no, let&#39;s keep the questions coming. We&#3=
9;ll answer them, we&#39;ll take notes, but very much a working session. Pe=
rfect. Okay. All right, so if you go to the next slide and this is going to=
 be a busy slide and so we&#39;ll start using your Excel for this. Again, s=
ore for the eyes but what this is and we&#39;ll pull up the sheet and walk =
through this. So let me do that here. Or would you prefer to do that? Srira=
m? No, go ahead. All right. As you said, this is a, this is an important vi=
ew that I personally wanted to ensure to define the scope of what systems a=
re critically important for isc. And so the way we develop this, there are,=
 by the way there start off with we have 300 plus systems and so there was =
no way that we have time to go and test all of those systems. So the teams =
went back and did a touch point on what are the systems that are extremely =
critical for us to ensure that we are ready for 8.1 or 11.1, depending on t=
he system. And each of the process owners from Logistics, cx, procurement a=
nd planning came back with a short list of say five to 10 systems each. And=
 this is a list of about 40 systems that have various dispositions, Buildpa=
ck, Movasis, mostly TSA that we have organized here. And the intent is to e=
nsure everybody has common understanding of what are those systems a which =
IT work streams and the PMs are leading the effort. From an IT perspective,=
 who are the business UAT leads? And really I think one thing that we&#39;r=
e like you see column F is very, very critical because there are some syste=
ms that we don&#39;t really need to do a whole lot of full testing. It&#39;=
s just a question of ensuring that the users have access and that the syste=
ms are cut over because there is really no development that is significantl=
y worthy to go full uat. But there are several systems that we do need to d=
o a full uat. And so we want to understand what those systems are and ensur=
e that we have a proper test plan for that. So that&#39;s why I set up this=
 System and with EY&#39;s help and with the IT Workstream leads help, we&#3=
9;re trying to fill this out so we all have the same understanding of what =
we&#39;re testing for and to what extent we&#39;re testing these systems fo=
r. That&#39;s the intent of this file. Great, thanks Sriram. Now if some of=
 you already have this information and I&#39;m looking at you, Bill and Sri=
nivas, you know some of this, you may already have all this information. If=
 so, you know, we can certainly send you the link and have you have you fil=
l that as well. But I think the idea is to walk through this and make sure =
that, you know, these are the systems that are getting touched as part of, =
you know, Sriram&#39;s and functional scope, ISE&#39;s functional scope. So=
 if there&#39;s anything else that you think, think from our perspective, f=
rom an IT perspective, the systems should be included here. You know, let&#=
39;s have that conversation as well. So Rakesh, I have two questions. Numbe=
r one, before this call, I think we had a internal IT connect where we were=
 talking about the business availability for the upcoming uat. Right? Okay.=
 And then when the closest, the close, I understand is starts I think the w=
eek of the 23rd of June and then probably it should close by 30th. Right. T=
hen when the business will be available for the UAT that is number one. And=
 then the window that we are looking currently, 7th to 11th, July 7th to 11=
th. Right. Again it depends based on list of scenarios scope that one used =
one want to execute for each of these processes. Right. Number two, why do =
we have collections twice on your spreadsheet one it says and then there is=
 one banking port which I understand that&#39;s the cash app collections. S=
o what is those two different collections here? What is the scope of those =
two collections here? Yep, so we can talk through those. So the first thing=
 first. Yes. So Your point on July 7th to 11th? I think so the action item =
here is to understand business availability, to be able to support that. So=
 I think Shriram, that&#39;s probably a takeaway. Either we can address it =
here or have that as a takeaway to come back and validate business availabi=
lity. Now shreem, are you looking for any specifics on that or is that more=
 of a. And by that I mean, you know, do we need business availability acros=
s certain regions, across certain locations. When I say business availabili=
ty across the process. Right. Processes could be someone involving with AP =
or it could be someone from the collections disputes, credit management or =
anyone who will be engaged from order management from again this explicitly=
 for business. Right, right. So what is their availability today when the u=
sers will be available? I think that is key. Right. For me to have my test =
scripts ready. I&#39;ll have to go back and work with the business because =
list of scenarios needs to be documented what they want me to cover in the =
testing the scope. Therefore I wanted to understand their availability. Bas=
ed on that we can come up is like one week window is enough or two weeks wi=
ndow of your interview business. Yeah, got it. I mean I think it&#39;s a go=
od, good question Srinivas. I think that&#39;s why in column G we have iden=
tified the business UAT for that specific sub function lead. For CX it woul=
d be Mihala Preeta and then for collections it&#39;d be Unis. You can come =
to me overall from an ISE point of view and I&#39;ll be happy to set some t=
ime to go and get those details and the answer can be different for each fu=
nction. So. So let&#39;s take that offline. The contact names are given her=
e for that reason specifically so that the IT team and the business team ca=
n talk to each other and ensure that your test scenarios are aligned and th=
e owners of actual Testers and the timeline is all aligned. Right. So I thi=
nk we can do that. Not in this meeting, but I&#39;m happy to have additiona=
l conversations offline with you. Okay. Okay. And for everyone&#39;s benefi=
t. And some of you may not have access to the ITAthens folder, but if you d=
o, at least the IT team will. Srinivasan team. I&#39;ve posted this particu=
lar file. I&#39;m sharing in there for your reference. Now, the second ques=
tion you asked about the systems. So this was a. These were the systems ide=
ntified and we went back and looked at this as master app inventory. So tha=
t what you see in column A are the systems that Sriram and the team and the=
 functions have identified as impacted by their scope of testing. So if the=
re&#39;s something that is either a duplicate or needs validation or rectif=
ying here, we can certainly do that and clarify if there are certain things=
 that are wrongly called out here or if it&#39;s a wrong system in your. In=
 your opinion, then we can certainly modify it here and correct it if there=
&#39;s something missing as well. We can do that. So you were talking about=
, you said Jira on top. Correct for collections. Yeah, I know that&#39;s mo=
re of a process where they use Zira corrections, but then we have one more.=
 So here is where we create a work list for the. The collection specialist =
to go test based on company or based on what they wanted us to cover in tha=
t. In that. So just wanted to double check the expectation for those two li=
ne items. That&#39;s the reason why I asked you that question. Fair enough.=
 And I think Harry, you&#39;re on as well. So. So I know we said Banking Po=
rtals is not just one nice little app, it&#39;s perhaps a series of them. C=
orrect. I&#39;ll get that clarified with Eunice. On what? All portals are i=
ncluded in there. Take an action there. This is a collection. So I believe =
that they need to validate the bank statement ally as well as the system li=
ke hrc. So Units Hurricane is really managing the hrc. You know, that&#39;s=
 another app. Let me cover here. It&#39;s not just for the portal itself. S=
o. Sorry, what was that? What was that? Okay, so this is high radius. Okay.=
 Yeah. Okay, let me make a comment here. That. Yeah, so this is not a speci=
fic specific. It&#39;s access to bank portal as is. Got it. Okay. And I thi=
nk you mentioned hrc. Right. So that&#39;s from Harry. And then the other p=
art here we mentioned, and I know I pulled in Gary in here. So this is real=
ly more of a process. So maybe we need to have A follow up here as well wit=
h Eunice on now to your point, Srinivasi said the requirement for the use o=
f this. Yes. All right. I think. I think that one, if I remember correctly =
maybe somebody from the CX organization might be able to back me up here. B=
ut I. I think if customers end up paying to the wrong company, they would h=
ave. The collections team would have to make an entry in JIRA for the recon=
ciliation process. So. And then the. The monies would then be flowing to th=
e correct entity after the approval via jira. That is my recollection of wh=
at unis needs that for, but I can confirm that there are that or other appl=
ications as well. Okay. I think this is more of a. My understanding is the =
JIRA is more of a tracking right. For any request that they want to get rev=
iewed or approved. So yeah, probably to get it clarified between Srira. Sur=
e. Yeah. Okay. Now sh. We do have a few other ERP apps. I think there were =
a couple that got thrown over to you from when we spoke with Goku in Pramod=
 from a couple of days ago. I believe Optivision. Do you want to. Do you mi=
nd. Sorry for the interruption. Do you want to filter out specific? We cert=
ainly can. Okay, let&#39;s do this. Let&#39;s make sure again these are the=
 right ones. So sus portal was a lib without and we note that as a dcom we =
need to understand what is in scope or what would replace it in the scope o=
f this testing. So whether it&#39;s even in scope to be tested. Would you o=
r Bill have a view on that? I&#39;m not aware about this app, Bill. You kno=
w I suggest let&#39;s. Let&#39;s circle back serum on this. I might touch b=
ase on this if I recollect correctly. It was agreed that only it is not nee=
ded for solidus because of the volume and the other details that we have. A=
dditionally using the apo, I think we share the forecast with the BW portal=
, with the BICs, with our vendors or suppliers. That could be another reaso=
n why why it was not suggested. But then let&#39;s circle back to close thi=
s gap. Okay. So can you just kill a call with you me and Siram include Jesu=
s on that please? Yeah. These are business from procurement point of view. =
Okay, perfect. And promotion this one. This might need to be used from soft=
 spin is to hard spin. So for readiness we will need to make sure that this=
 continue to work until we get the final migration to Ariba and EDI other p=
ortals. But overall it will be the commission for the hard spin. Yes, fair =
enough. Good point you&#39;re making because this is a day one disposition =
of a dcom for day one. But yeah, or live without for day one. So at soft sp=
in then you&#39;re. You&#39;re. You&#39;re spot on. But if it&#39;s still l=
ive, then there might be some testing or some. Some requirement there. Okay=
. So I&#39;ve taken it as a follow up. Optavision is the other one. Optivis=
ion. If I understand correctly. This should be with Engineering. Okay, but =
Zariba is with the erp, right? I mean that&#39;s what we already categorize=
d. Which one you&#39;re talking Goku. We were talking about Ariba before Ar=
iba. No, no, we will come back. No, yeah, yeah, let&#39;s get to that. Opti=
vision. So we see Engineering. Okay, I&#39;m just gonna make a note here. I=
s. Is Optavision not the. The planning tool used in Huntsville? Yeah, it is=
. That&#39;s what I was going to say. It&#39;s their erp. Yeah, it&#39;s th=
ere. Okay. It&#39;s erp. Oh okay. Yeah. So let me make sure then. So, so, s=
o when we say it&#39;s erp. But. But here. There&#39;s a team here in erp. =
Yeah, yeah. But the thing about it is they use it for, for advanced plannin=
g. They use it like for apo. They don&#39;t really use apo. They use Optavi=
sion and then put the data into APO from Optavision. There&#39;s an integra=
tion. There&#39;s an integration between Optavision and CAP 900. I get it. =
I think what I meant was the IT work stream that is involved with Athens mi=
gration of these systems. Right. So it&#39;s an ERP work stream led by SRI =
and Bill. Right. Like I want to make. Make sure that they discussed this on=
e Optivision long time back when we are dispositioning all our applications=
 and this is a planning tool. So I don&#39;t. That&#39;s the reason why I t=
hink this did not come up to erp. Let me understand. JD you say when it&#39=
;s planning tool what is. We do out of. We did the advanced planning. It is=
 all that. The planning. The optimization is planning for possible plan. Ba=
sically how the to. How do they plan all the roles and all the different va=
riant configuration materials from Optimism from Optavision and then that d=
ata will be transferred back to SAP. Yeah. So what is the disposition? SRI =
is it move as is. I would imagine optimization is more as is. Yes. And who.=
 Who owns it SRI today? No, that is. Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m so wonde=
ring right now. That is that is categorized and under planning applications=
 no, it&#39;s not planning. Okay. I mean, at least from the service categor=
y on your perspective, I know this is not. But then, Jerry, let&#39;s conne=
ct. It might be treated as a planning tool, but it might be a scheduling to=
ol. Let&#39;s understand that. Let&#39;s have a meeting with Jerry and we w=
ill walk through this. Okay, perfect. This is the exact benefit of this mee=
ting. I just wanted to make sure. Yeah. So you need to understand, I mean, =
why it&#39;s falling under planning and cmd. It is not. It is not under pla=
nning for sure. Same as the support last one, right? The previous one that =
you mentioned. Yeah, yeah. Different stakeholders in terms of the meeting. =
So Jerry, thank you. Appreciate it. Basically to reconfirm that with the st=
akeholders to align this template. Right? Yeah, yeah. Even if it is live wi=
thout. We need to make sure if those are aligned with relevant. Take a look=
. Yeah, thank you. So we&#39;ve got a couple here. So apo. Yep. Yeah, put i=
t in the chat. I mean, we&#39;re working with Burna on that. We&#39;re not =
working with Bill on the apo. Yeah, that&#39;s correct. So it is. There it =
is. Right. Okay. So. So it&#39;s not Bill. Who is it? I put it in Bill. Bil=
l is the pm. Is. Right. Okay. All right. It may be somebody as a POC you&#3=
9;re working with. So we&#39;ll poor. Okay. Ariba. Ariba is. No, it&#39;s. =
Ariba is the rpr. That&#39;s right. Okay, so SRI and Bill, as you go throug=
h this, I. I would like maybe after this meeting would like your input on t=
he testing requirement call column. Right. Something as simple as full UAT =
or basic testing. What is the extent of it testing that we need to do with =
business on. On each of these apps. Okay. Ariba. I don&#39;t know. Again, l=
et me check with hi moms for me. A lot of surprises today&#39;s call. Basic=
ally, so I don&#39;t know why. Bill, did you hear anything on Ariba coming =
to your feet? It&#39;s not coming sri. We agreed this like four months back=
. One second. I&#39;m asking Bill, basically. Bill, you there? I am. Yeah. =
I don&#39;t know. It was giving me some sort of warning every time I tried =
to come off mute. Yeah, it must be the co pilot messing up. Apologize. Okay=
, yeah, I&#39;m sorry. So the question was, are we going to be testing Arib=
a? Yeah, that&#39;s what the question is. Right. I mean it was not in our f=
ull end to end testing scope. No. Right. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. It=
&#39;s a tsa, right? Which means we&#39;re not changing or just paying for =
the service. Correct. So for TSAs, do you need any testing at this point? I=
n one or two exceptions we&#39;re finding that is the case. But on the whol=
e, no. Right. So one of the ISE applications, even though it&#39;s tsa, the=
re are some minor changes that are being done September wise which is forci=
ng us to do a uat. User asset control should be that in place. But we need =
to make sure if this particular instance is dedicatedly for am. If so no te=
sting of course not going to be. But then you still need to validate the lo=
gical separation and you still need to validate the sso. So there will be s=
ome still minor U. But then it&#39;s needed. That&#39;s my, that&#39;s my s=
uggestion. User control to be done for sure. As you mentioned. Yes. The sso=
, they have to validate. Correct. So yeah, I mean there&#39;s no lot of tes=
ting. But then the testing needs to be done. So. Brian Davis. Go ahead. Bri=
an, are you having difficulty unmuting as well? Yeah, somehow when you unmu=
te, if you&#39;re getting some messages. I&#39;m also having the same thing=
. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay. No, I&#39;m. I&#39;m the. For those w=
ho don&#39;t know, I&#39;m the systems lead for Spectra, so I kind of overs=
ee. And there&#39;s other people on the call. Jay over for Jason Boyd basic=
ally. And so I&#39;m looking at Spectra and pack out and chi and there&#39;=
s four. There&#39;s three or four applications and LIMs. Our team, to my kn=
owledge, we&#39;re at a loss as to what is going on here, where testing is =
going to be done, what&#39;s the extent of the testing. We need a. A reboot=
 here for. For our local team to get on the same page with what you are dis=
cussing. Okay. So we need to take it offline to another call. But we&#39;re=
. Of course this seems to be at a very high level and not at the point leve=
l. Yeah, I think Brian, the problem is we need to align on the high level f=
irst before we encourage. Get to what you&#39;re asking. Right. So like we =
need to agree what testing is required for a given system and then we need =
to decide what plants we need to test it at. Right. But they need to tell u=
s. What I don&#39;t understand is what is changing. Depending on what is ch=
anging will drive what we need to test. That&#39;s what this meeting is abo=
ut, Brian. But what I&#39;m. What I&#39;m saying is I don&#39;t. I don&#39;=
t know what their what system? What are they changing in this? We&#39;re, I=
&#39;m assuming we&#39;re gonna have, we&#39;re gonna get access to a new s=
erver and we&#39;re gonna test on I, I, I don&#39;t even know what the conn=
ectivity is between all. Yeah Brian, no one&#39;s asking me to make assumpt=
ions. So the team needs to come back with the scope of the change. Yeah, I =
think it&#39;s clear that they owe you that. But you&#39;re asking us to te=
st in 13 days. No, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not. That&#39;s why we asked for th=
is meeting Brian. Because we are not aligned as a leadership team on what n=
eeds to be tested, who needs to be involved. Okay, so what we&#39;re trying=
 to get at here is to clarify just what you said. What is changing on these=
 systems like, for example, ERP, CIP 900, it&#39;s a TSA. Do we need what k=
ind of testing do we need? Because that&#39;s a pretty generic system. Righ=
t. It&#39;s everything. So you know, we need someone on this team to come b=
ack to us and I guess what trio I&#39;m starting to drive at is what testin=
g is needed and then we can identify okay, these are the people that need t=
o be involved. We&#39;re not even close to that right now. Correct? That&#3=
9;s right. We&#39;re building that so that, that&#39;s. Thanks, thanks Jaso=
n for clarifying that. That&#39;s why it pms. We need your help to fill tha=
t column F as soon as possible. Like today if possible explain you know wha=
t level of testing we need. Okay. All right. Chase. Chase. Hey. Hey guys. A=
lso representing the Spectra business. It seems that there&#39;s entire sys=
tems that are critical to day to day Spectra business that are just not lis=
ted at all. What if we have situations like that is the ask kind of for the=
 users at the site level and the LOB level to make sure that basically this=
 is accurate. I guess a concern I have is that there just maybe is some sys=
tems that aren&#39;t even included right now. So I&#39;m happy to take your=
 input Chase. Like I think once you unfilter and take a look at it, see if =
there are systems that you think are important and not showing here. The wh=
ole funneled that to me and I&#39;m happy to take that back to the team and=
 go look at it. But we&#39;ve asked the functional teams for what systems a=
re critical. I&#39;m not going to say this is foolproof and 100% done. I th=
ink this is a good starting point and if there&#39;s edits that need to be =
done to add more systems. Let&#39;s work and get that full list done here. =
Got it. The other, the other thing is too. We need to understand what needs=
 to be tested for the 8.1go live and the 1027 go live because there&#39;s t=
wo different lines. That&#39;s the other piece that needs to be. That would=
 help add clarity. That&#39;s a good point. Yeah, good point. We&#39;ll add=
 that column. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. No, very good discussion. Thank you. I=
 think these are relevant questions and as you can see it&#39;s, it&#39;s, =
you know we&#39;re just working through it. So. But yes, so I think the oth=
er point you made Stephen as well ERP quite generic but we know 8. 1 all th=
e legal entity changes happening in ERP. So Sri and Bill are all over that =
in terms of the scope of testing etc. So again, you know, let us know there=
. Bill, IBM, Sterling, Srinivasa, Sri, IBM Sterling is an EDI one and we ne=
ed to do that is already part of our. Our activities. Okay. And then you&#3=
9;ve got see 1. 1 comment. I assume that Christ is involved in that. Christ=
ina Delko But I just wanted to. Yeah, he&#39;s involved in that. He&#39;s h=
elping us to build that. So. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, there was a couple of oth=
er ones. I mean this one, see, this one&#39;s under planning. So it&#39;s. =
It&#39;s. I don&#39;t know the difference between this one. But I again, Sh=
iram, maybe you can help me here. It&#39;s the same. It looks like it&#39;s=
 the same ECC SIP 900 but it&#39;s a separate line item. So. Yeah, ECC and =
BW are separate systems, but they&#39;re all in. Okay. Okay. Itself is a on=
e system. Right. One application. Right. So. Right, right across the board.=
 Yeah. All right. So okay. Wind Shuttle. That just seems again from a CX to=
ol. I think Prita. I think someone from. I don&#39;t know anything. Erica i=
s working with the contract renewal for windshuttle. That is what the lates=
t information. I got it. We are extremely conceivably using in master Data =
management and cx. Yeah. But is there any testing required for venture busi=
ness? Nothing is changing for. No, no, no testing. Testing is not required =
at all. Stream. Yeah. Because that is just a renewal. Contract is just from=
 the license standpoint. That&#39;s a license, right. Not from the testing =
standpoint. No. Yeah, you are right. There is no testing. Yeah, yeah. Becau=
se this is the standalone tool. This is basically. They use this tool to au=
tomate all the master data Activities to upload customer master to upload m=
aterial master to make changes to any other master data. So yeah, we can do=
 a quick glance, but nothing is changing over there. Okay, but we&#39;re ke=
eping the access to the same people that have the access. We&#39;re not cha=
nging anything regarding that. Right. Licenses are the same. Will access ne=
ed to change Right now Erica is. Is controlling everything and she is part =
of this attendance team and the. Sounds like moving. So she&#39;s already w=
orking as part of the license renewal. Oh, how many. That&#39;s a separate =
topic, right? I don&#39;t want to. Okay, okay. We have a separate topic. We=
 have a separate communication going on. This one. Yeah, the license renewa=
l and all those things. License itself is a separate topic all by itself. S=
o I&#39;m talking more accurate. So yeah, a license all sorted out hopefull=
y. But will access change to using the tool? Everything is from CIP 900 onl=
y. Exactly. Yeah. All these things are currently CIP 900. There is no diffe=
rent access AP 900. Understood. Thank you. There were a couple of others on=
 apo, BW and snp. These are also on to the ERP team. So. Correct. That BW i=
s not part of erp. That BW should be part of ima. Okay. Yeah. Rajesh is pro=
bably not here, but then. Yeah, I mean we are. We are Siri. We all are. All=
 are reviewing that with Rajesh. So he knows it. They&#39;re the one. They =
are. They are working through the dispensation for it. Okay. One who are wo=
rking through the reporting. The report that we have. The planning organiza=
tion uses the reports, the S reports. So they are the ones who are who are =
working through that. Okay, so it&#39;s not so Rajesh. G. Okay. Snp. I don&=
#39;t know. I mean it&#39;s again a duplicate entry. I&#39;m okay that if y=
ou want to have that. But then it&#39;s part of the rule number 16 only. Oh=
, SEM. Yeah, yeah, it&#39;s. It&#39;s together we can remove it. Yeah. Okay=
. So pramo, just one quick question over here because obviously apo, you kn=
ow, we have demand planning, we have snp. That is all comes under APO only =
anyway. Right. So what is the plan? You guys will be doing some testing and=
 then they need to be an end to end testing from SAP standpoint also. Corre=
ct. That&#39;s what it is. And it is only everything from the IS system sta=
ndpoint. It is part of the erp. EP is part of the ERP work stream on the IT=
 and Purna and my team as coordinating that putting the efforts with the pa=
rtners that we have in the project. Okay. And I just want to call out that =
we got an integration between CIP 900 and CAP 900. So we whatever changes i=
n CIP 900, we got to make sure it can still talk to the CAP 900. Correct. A=
nd that&#39;s the reason we have that under TSA. And Jerry and Poorna are d=
efinitely coordinating it very well. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Okay, cool. This i=
s great. Thank you. Again, the action item. We&#39;ll have the teams go bac=
k in here and populate what sort of testing or the scope of testing require=
d. Jerry, this is Kathryn Hart. I do want to mention that in the test envir=
onment, CAP 900 and CIP 900 don&#39;t talk to each other the way they do in=
 the live environment. So testing is going to be very difficult. We&#39;ve =
got some work to do to make sure we can test that integration. So you bring=
 up a good point. Just a general question for the team, and we may not solv=
e it here, but are all of these in a QA environment or test environment? Wh=
ere is testing going to happen? Because I think what I heard in prior conve=
rsations is there isn&#39;t necessarily a neat little environment for testi=
ng for one or two of these. And we may have to use sandbox environment for =
testing. So I want to make sure that. That we have that in our minds as wel=
l as we go through this. Yes, testing is required, but some of those, you k=
now, the environment availability and data availability is also something t=
hat we need to have in the back of our minds as we discuss this. Yeah, yeah=
. Let me start from the ERP standpoint and then I will get into the standar=
d way, at least from our standpoint, how we normally do this, setting these=
 UAT sign offs. Right. So what we do is from the ERP standpoint, we are pla=
nning to start our integration testings. When I call integration testings. =
Whatever has been done, everything is in cix, which is our sandbox. So we d=
o validation in the sandbox, making sure that everything is okay. Right. In=
cluding the forms, the changes, the terms and conditions, whatever we are p=
lanning from that workstream standpoint. So everything will be validated in=
 CIX as part of the integration testing. So the goal is basically use that.=
 The whatever we are discussing from July 7th to 11th is basically move eve=
rything to CAQ. But the end to end testing need to be signed off in ciq bec=
ause that is where we take all our programs or whatever validated from Sand=
box, move to ciq, and then CIQ is the one that we have almost integrations,=
 almost with all the Systems in cix we may not have integrations with all t=
he third party systems, but Q is the key one. But end to end UAT sign off i=
s the ciq. Yeah, but CIQ APO will not push our planned orders to ecc. Yeah.=
 From APO standpoint, I think we need to see what, what needs to be done ba=
sically because that is. That plays a different role. Yeah, those connectio=
ns will have to be set up because right now when we do one off testing, we =
do a manual push between the two systems. But we&#39;ll need to automate th=
at so that we can simulate production. Yeah. How we need to coordinate the =
testing activities for APO standpoint. Okay, so takeaway here for those exc=
eptions. So what I understood, if I translate you right, SRI is it will be =
in ciq, the quality environment. That&#39;s where end to end testing will h=
appen and sign offs will happen by exception. We where that is not the case=
, we will have to find the workarounds or the temporary integrations to be =
built to complete that testing. Exactly. Because at the end of the day when=
 we do an end to end, somebody is signing off. That means that all the flow=
 has been validated. That&#39;s the reason why we need to pick one system. =
If we do it in two places, I don&#39;t know when we move back, I don&#39;t =
know whether behaving the same or anything has been changed. Okay. Now in t=
erms. Okay, so we&#39;ll document that and make sure. Now who&#39;s followi=
ng up on that? Is that you, SRI or your team that will have the ownership o=
n that as you work with each of the other ownership, obviously. Right. As y=
ou know, we are the ERP ones and majority comes to ERP only at some point. =
But we just definitely need, you know, I need to talk to Corona for example=
 if it is AP or. Right. You know. Yeah, but from our. We have the ownership=
. Okay, got it. Perfect. How about data? What sort of data needs to be seed=
ed, where, et cetera? Again, not to get into the details of it, but each of=
 these scenario requirements. I presume you&#39;re already having the conve=
rsations on the data requirements that need to be there. Yeah, data from da=
ta standpoint. Again, CIQ is a recent refreshed of CIP in the site. Yeah, c=
iq, CIX got refreshed sometime in CIQ got refreshed sometime end of fifth a=
nd CIX got refreshed sometime in March, basically. So it&#39;s almost like,=
 like, almost like a fresh copy of a production date. Okay, yeah, fresh cop=
y of. So data standpoint, whatever we have it in cip all the material maste=
r, customer, vendor or below materials, whatever it from master data from p=
ricing, whatever we have it in P that should be good in Q. Okay so data sta=
ndpoint. So at least what I am thinking if somebody please correct me from =
maybe Prita from your standpoint or any from the ISC standpoint that is you=
 know CAQ is already is a fresh off CIP so I&#39;m assuming that should not=
 be a problem. And from ERP standpoint what is happening right now? Bill is=
 working with the team to build automated test scripts. Right. Getting all =
the different different scenarios. So what the team is planning as soon as =
the scripts are available? Maybe. I&#39;m not sure Bill, it should be somet=
ime mid next week that the plan is these test scripts will be coordinated t=
o Sriram and then you know that is the starting validation point from us to=
 give the basic scenarios. These are the scenarios what we are planning to =
do if business wants to add anything and they can let us know. We&#39;ll se=
e whether. How can we automate so that we can save time when we move to ciq=
? Yep, thank you. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s gonna go. Sorry, just a quick=
 one Rakesh. I know we have 15 minutes to go. 15 minutes. Yes. Several othe=
r topics to touch but Brian, I have a quick question. Please go ahead. Yeah=
. So are we going to be using our. The existing CIX 900 and CIQ 900. Yes. O=
kay. Yes, yes. So we are. We are still doing development work right now in =
CIX and CIQ for current projects. When is is that going to get turned off o=
n before the 23rd pointing to a different place or what development are you=
 referring any specific project? Yeah, we have our own project going on in =
Spectra they said was good through July. Whatever we we told. Maybe I need =
to follow up on that. We. We were asking all our teams whatever development=
 projects that is happening they need to wrap it up by June 27th. That is t=
he last date they have. We cannot take anything to July because of the cuto=
ver activities. We need to lock all the. No new code should be done. Right.=
 So maybe from your. If you can send me the details I will check with. Is t=
his anything related to the toller portal? Yeah, it&#39;s between the porta=
l and SAP. It&#39;s Prashad. Prashad&#39;s leading it right now I guess. Ye=
ah, I&#39;ll send you the details but I thought you&#39;re going to start s=
ome testing on June 23rd, right? No, no, no. Let&#39;s not confuse. Right. =
Whatever activities what is happening June 23 is for project Athens basical=
ly. Right, so what Prasad is working. That&#39;s not project items, that&#3=
9;s a separate activity for Toller Pro project. I will check with Prasad. W=
hen are they planning to move to production so that we can coordinate. But =
the goal is whatever is the new code should be done before end of June. Gre=
at, thank you for the question and clarity. Appreciate it. Okay. All right,=
 so going other work streams? Yeah, let&#39;s do. And I know we&#39;ve only=
 got you know, 13 minutes so I do want to circle back. So you know, lots of=
 good conversations here, lots of action items we&#39;re taking on. I think=
 you know, we&#39;ll parking lot the entry exit criteria and some of the, t=
he access issues. But let&#39;s go through, you know, we&#39;ll set up a fo=
llow up session for specific teams and I think Stephen, I think you may be =
still on. I doubt there&#39;s very little on CCEX here, here in terms of sc=
ope of testing. But can you opine on where we are with, you know, what we m=
ay or may not need to do with hybris, magento, sftc, alemica, etc. Yeah. He=
y. Hi team. So for BRV, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve got really anything tha=
t we, that we need to accommodate because all of these applications are you=
 know, TS8 right now. One question I wanted to ask the team is we&#39;re al=
ready in ccex, we&#39;re already building out all of our test scenarios, ri=
ght. For user, for SIT and then uat. So you know, we&#39;re looking at, you=
 know, every application and you know, application testing and then complet=
e end to end testing and we are engaging with the business to build those, =
you know, complete the complete inventory of test scenarios, you know, as w=
e, as we move forward over the next couple of weeks. So is this over and ab=
ove that, Rakesh? Because we are, you know, we&#39;re kind of, we&#39;re ki=
nd of moving along that line as it stands, knowing we&#39;ll have, you know=
, if you take Hybris as an example, obviously we&#39;ve got some changes in=
 there that we&#39;re going to test. You know, a complete end to end cycle.=
 And for you that&#39;s a day one activity, correct? It&#39;s not a BRV act=
ivity. Nice. Correct, yeah. So I think this one, in this case, this is all =
the systems that as part of ISE are getting touched. So I think this to if =
my understanding then Stephen would be like, so let&#39;s say Hybris, there=
&#39;s no change in hybrids, it&#39;s a TSA on Day one. But you&#39;re work=
ing towards a UAT for your day one. So for brv, you know, the scope of test=
ing may be minimal to none here. We may have to look at what the scope of t=
esting is for day one and sync up with Sriram on that. So we may need to ma=
ke that distinction. Correct. Somebody correct me if I&#39;m. If I&#39;m mi=
speaking. I have a question. Okay, go ahead. So as far as we understood, we=
 understood that I think the same question Prita has because Ioana was aski=
ng us from Salesforce. You want to stand for the email addresses. I underst=
and that we will need to have them with the Solstice domain in Salesforce. =
And my understanding was that would that happen after or on the 1st of Augu=
st or a bit after 1st of August. So would we need to test that now? Very go=
od point. What we&#39;ve been told on the ERP side is that it&#39;s not an =
eight. One deliverable. Right. I have heard the same thing that email addre=
sses is going to be post 8. 1. Yes. So my question here is Sri. My question=
 was like, like do we really need to test reframe and Magento and Hybris pe=
rspective when they place an order from these platform? It does because the=
y&#39;re not changing anything other than email id and from 1st of August n=
othing is changing. So do we really need to test that? No, no, no. That&#39=
;s what it is. Right. We have some cases like we do not have any changes bu=
t at least what suggesting, right. You know you need to get into all detail=
ed level of testing. But at least if you can run a phase scenario just to m=
ake sure that everything is okay, that&#39;s what it is. Because this is no=
t a physical separation, right. You know nothing, nothing is happening. Exa=
ctly. Everything remains the same. No. No network changes, no IP changes. E=
verything remains the same. So you don&#39;t need to test anything but at l=
east for the purpose of like making sure that. Yeah, the flow is there just=
 to validate the flow. Maybe you can just run, run one simple scenario and =
say that I&#39;m good to go. Okay. So you can displace one order from this.=
 Who, who, who would do that? Simple test scenario. Is it a business? We ha=
ve to do CX business? Yeah. Okay. So three, do they need to do the SSO test=
ing? SSO is which one? This one is. You are talking about E Commerce Portal=
 only, right? Or a different one? No. Yes. Single sign on will be part of t=
he overall testing scenario. That&#39;s already in scope. Yeah, single sign=
 on is part of their scope. Yes, that&#39;s correct. In Rakesh. I&#39;m goi=
ng to sort of challenge a couple of things on this sheet. Right. Yeah, yeah=
. Because the EDI Elenica, that was MERT erp. Right. As a solution as the s=
ervice. That&#39;s most definitely. That was, that was a while back. Okay. =
The RPA Automation should be ima. Okay. Right. And then I actually think th=
e gen. I&#39;m not 100% sure what that application is referencing to. I thi=
nk we&#39;ve got to check that. I was just looking at the background that t=
he, the master inventory sheet and there&#39;s you know, there&#39;s severa=
l, several references to gen, you know, generically. So I think we probably=
 need to just look at that and see well, what exactly does that mean? Becau=
se we don&#39;t, we&#39;ve got sort of, you know. So I don&#39;t think we n=
eed to test anything on the 1st of August there because ideally again nothi=
ng is changing. What we&#39;re using Genai for is classifying cases that ar=
e going through Salesforce. So it&#39;s hosted on Salesforce. So if testing=
 on Generic will have or on Salesforce starts in Morocco anyways in mid Aug=
ust or something then that&#39;s when you test that as well. Now I still ha=
ve a question. I&#39;m sorry Stephen, I see you have your hands up and I ju=
mped here. But still regarding emails, I will go back to that because there=
 are some emails coming from sales saying that from communications with cus=
tomers that they&#39;re in order to set up their vendor id which is a very =
important thing for us in the Esso cut over and in everything that we&#39;r=
e going after the 1st of August they will need us to have the new domain em=
ail addresses in some of the cases like the automotive customers. So we wil=
l need to have the domain available on 1st of August. And I&#39;m just rais=
ing this here, I don&#39;t know if this is a possibility or not, but this i=
s what just raised today. Okay. No, thank you for bringing that to our atte=
ntion. Let me do a follow up. And, and Vince, not to put put you on the spo=
t here, from an, from an IAM perspective those emails would be available. C=
orrect. And in the system by 8.1. I don&#39;t know in the system but certai=
nly available prior to 8.1. Yes. So email addresses are available now. That=
&#39;s Saurabh Khanna and the Dex Messaging team. It&#39;s not IAM but unde=
rstood are available. The mailboxes however have not been created yet. Okay=
 so all right, so email address is available. Mailbox is not created yet. S=
o we need to understand, perhaps dig dip. But maybe I will drop it here and=
 we can catch up offline so that we don&#39;t. So we, we don&#39;t block th=
e discussion on this now. Understood. I will record you. Yeah, the request.=
 Okay, so we&#39;ll have a. Yes. Stephen, just time&#39;s wrapping up. I wa=
nt to make sure we clarity on go forward to start getting some items addres=
sed here. Make sure we&#39;re working on that. Let&#39;s get organized goin=
g forward. Understood. So again, quite a bit of work to do here. So I know =
we wanted to talk through. If we go back to our, you know, let me go back t=
o the content we were sharing earlier. Right. So if we go back to our agend=
a here. So test dates and windows, you know, we have a list here of the tes=
t dates and windows that we&#39;ve gotten from the teams. We will send that=
 out. We just write it. Yeah. Okay. Slide&#39;s a little slower then you&#3=
9;re kind of. Is that good? Are you able to see my screen now or no? No. Ok=
ay, give me one second. Again. How about now? Yeah. Okay. All right. So aga=
in the first item, I think we&#39;re making progress but we still need quit=
e a bit of work. So there&#39;s, there&#39;s a homework for everyone here t=
o go back in and complete that. And at least the column on, you know, the t=
esting required, the test dates and windows, we will send that out. This is=
 what the teams have published as the sit UAT dates. We&#39;ll send that ou=
t. Make sure that&#39;s again a follow up conversation that&#39;s needed on=
 aligning the windows and business availability. So I think we have an acti=
on item there certainly, you know, for ERP 23rd to 30th June and then 7 to =
11th of July. So we&#39;ll have to follow up on the business availability a=
cross processes, the entry exit criteria. I think this is something we&#39;=
ll also send out. Please take a look at that. And for particularly the folk=
s that will be signing off and the function leads, take a look and see what=
 may or may not need to be adjusted there. We didn&#39;t really get around =
too much. I know we have a few couple of follow ups on test scripts. Automa=
ting of test scripts, finalizing the test scripts and understanding. So the=
re&#39;s quite a few follow ups. I think sri you and the team. What I heard=
 from was clearly the IT team will send what test scripts they have, the bu=
siness will validate and then add on top of that or align with whatever the=
 test scope scripts that the IT has. Right. So I&#39;m Waiting for SRI to s=
end us what the starting point is. Likewise when we&#39;ll take action. Yea=
h, as soon as they&#39;re available mid next week. That&#39;s what we&#39;r=
e targeting. Okay. And it&#39;s not just for erp and I want to make sure EX=
 and IMA and others are all doing the same thing. Yeah. So Stephen, I think=
 for you it may be a bit later because your UAT is and your plan calls for =
that for a bit later than now. I don&#39;t think we have IMA representation=
, Rajesh or anyone else in the sport. So that&#39;s a follow up that will l=
ead and then certainly promote. You&#39;ve got that. And then the next step=
s really in terms of. I don&#39;t think we ever discussed or you know, disc=
ussed the tools, some of the logistics and some of the, the access requirem=
ents. So that&#39;s a, that&#39;s a follow up. So perhaps that warrants a s=
ubset of our team here to have that conversation on the logistics, etc. So =
war will set that up as an, as a follow up as well. So I think those are th=
e things that I captured here notes and we&#39;ll certainly get the recordi=
ng out and the copilot notes out as well. Anything else I missed team? Anyt=
hing else you&#39;d like to discuss here? Because we&#39;ll set up a follow=
 up session clearly lots of good things to discuss and align and finalize o=
ver the next five, seven days. So certainly a follow up session warranted h=
ere. But if there&#39;s anything else pertinent, the critical or anything I=
 missed, I missed here. Rakesh, one thing I want a question for Stephen rea=
lly is Stephen, we have connected with planning, procurement and logistics =
to get the list of all the systems that are available for is. Right, like i=
n the scope but outside of this, are there any operationally from, from a i=
ndividual factory perspective or from a, like the systems that for example =
Brian put out in the chat area, Chase put up in the chat here and Brian put=
 that in the chat. Now those, those things, are they aligned to operations =
from your standpoint for the particular factories or is there, is there a l=
ist that we have to compile from that viewpoint that may not be aligned to =
the functions I mentioned before? Yeah, because we got some questions on th=
e MES that you connect into cip, but I didn&#39;t know how to approach that=
 answer. Have we not. Yeah, I&#39;ll connect you to that part of that. Have=
 we not engaged with the Gary Hamby&#39;s and the Joe Ryan&#39;s and I mean=
 the manufacturing IT folks on this because they have Pretty strong knowled=
ge of what you&#39;re talking about. We have and we haven&#39;t. Right. So =
it looks like things that expanded we have to do like probably, I would say=
 back up a bit and walk through the work that has been done. Going to look =
at these apps. A lot of these were, you know, brought up by the sites. We&#=
39;re going back to like November, December time frame where a large list w=
as populated and then a lot of work was done to reconcile what needed the a=
ction. So I&#39;m kind of thinking we need to back up and maybe walk the IS=
C team through that work. Why we&#39;re at where we are today. Okay, Stephe=
n, so is there a follow up with Gary Handy? We can set up that call? Becaus=
e if a lot of these are site apps and just move as is, there&#39;s nothing =
really necessarily changing from a process perspective for brv. So it may b=
e just that alignment. But some of the things are integrated with erp, with=
 SAP that Chase was bringing up. So, you know, bandwidth is changing on SAP=
. You always need to make sure the integration is not changing. But again, =
if you guys can walk us through what is and is not changing with ERP SAP, s=
o it makes sense. That&#39;s a good call out, Jason. Thank you. We&#39;ll s=
et that follow up with the site specific apps and the integration with erp.=
 Great. Okay. No, thank you all very much. This is super helpful, useful. W=
e&#39;ll set up a follow up call and then send, send out the notes and acti=
on items. Quite a few things coming out here. So again, thank you for your =
participation. Thank you. Thanks guys.</div></div></div><div style=3D"margi=
