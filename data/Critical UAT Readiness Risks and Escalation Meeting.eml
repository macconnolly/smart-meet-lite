Meeting Summary: Athens UAT and Hypercare MOS

*Date:* June 13, 2025
*Meeting Title:* Athens UAT and Hypercare MOS - Jeff/Sukai
*Duration:* Morning session (as per transcript and Teams screenshot)
------------------------------

   - Jeff Hopkins (external; key stakeholder)
   - Sukai Crook (external; key stakeholder)
   - Bill Miller (EY; escalated support/focus on organization)

   expert)

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *UAT and SIT Schedule Updates*

   - *Original UAT plan:* 6/21=E2=80=937/15
   - *New dates (as updated with ERP team):*
      - SIT: 6/23=E2=80=937/2
      - UAT:** 7/7=E2=80=937/11 (only 1 week, significantly compressed; pre=
viously
      two windows)
   - The initial UAT window was longer and more flexible, but now is highly
   compressed, increasing project risk.
   - Participation in UAT will require on-site attendance at the Morris
   Plains location.

*Risks Identified:*

   - Compression means reduced time for defect resolution and re-tests.
   - Potential conflicts due to vacation season; importance of resource
   coverage emphasized.
   - The group=E2=80=99s comfort and confidence in schedule viability has d=
ecreased
   due to these latest changes.

------------------------------
2. *Readiness and Preparation for UAT*

   - *Readiness Factors:* All pre-UAT activities (mapping applications,
   people, processes, inventory, logistics, scripts, tester assignment, etc=
.)
   are at various stages of completion or delay.
   - *Current Status (as of 6/12 - per status chart):*
      - Many preparatory tasks are still "In Progress" (yellow) and a few
      are "Not Started" (red), causing concern.
      - Applications, people mapped: Complete (green).
      - Critical tasks like process mapping, inventory preparation,
      defining scripts, and functional reviews remain incomplete or are onl=
y
      partially done.
   - *Concerns Specifically Cited:*
      - Lack of clear, accessible progress tracking and translation of test
      scenarios to actionable scripts.
      - Difficulty in integrating or extracting data/reporting from tools
      such as Capital Edge, Smartsheets, Tosca.
      - Absence of central orchestration and a unified view for leadership
      decision-making.

------------------------------
3. *Resource Alignment, Communications, and Accountability*

   - *Coverage for UAT:*
      - Functional leads have been tasked with ensuring tester coverage
      (including for absences).
      - If assigned testers are unavailable, the onus is on them (with
      their leadership=E2=80=99s support) to find substitutes.
      - Matt Bernstein newly announced as Solstice PMO lead; to act as a
      "mirror" to drive project performance with Rakesh.
   - *All-Hands Focus:*
      - A sense of "all hands on deck": willingness to reassign or escalate
      resources (e.g., potential involvement of Jessica Grusen).
      - The need for stronger orchestration and clear central
      accountability was repeatedly stressed by several leaders.

------------------------------
4. *Tooling and Automation Considerations*

   - Introduction of Tosca, an AI-based automated testing tool, for SIT/UAT=
.
      - Some leaders expressed concern over introducing a major new tool in
      such a compressed window.
      - Own experience said Tosca can be risky to integrate under tight
      timelines, especially without full team familiarity.
   - Importance of drawing on previous experience (from Honeywell and
   elsewhere) and ensuring regression and process scenario coverage.

------------------------------
5. *Test Scope and Test Script Documentation*

   - *Areas to Cover:*
      - Asset and liability movement, payroll, banking system changes.
      - Ensuring all impact areas are defined and have corresponding test
      scripts, especially areas with structural (entity-level) changes.
   - *Current State:*
      - Functional teams (Finance, Supply Chain, Commercial, HR, etc.) have
      partially provided scenarios; integration into test scripts was
incomplete
      or unclear.
      - Central registry/report with all script counts, assignments, and
      readiness is lacking/late.
   - *Reporting and Tracking:*
      - Stakeholders demand immediate improvement in reporting=E2=80=94what=
=E2=80=99s
      tested, what remains, who=E2=80=99s executing, and progress status.

------------------------------
6. *Leadership Expectations, Escalations, and Next Steps*

   - *Escalation:*
      - Direct expressions of dissatisfaction with the lack of progress,
      clarity, and missing data at this stage.
      - Bill Miller (EY) explicitly tasked with making project organization
      and information flow his "primary focus" until the blockers are clear=
ed.
      - Demand for daily progress meetings until all issues are remediated,
      as any further delays are unacceptable.
   - *Expectations for Next Meeting (Fri, June 20):*
      - Fully detailed, up-to-date status on:
         - Test scripts by function/work stream
         - Named testers and their coverage
         - UAT schedule and logistics
         - Confirmed access, data availability, and environment readiness
         - Entry/exit criteria
         - Risk analysis and remediation plan
      - Transparent, "well-oiled machine" reporting for leadership.
   - *Hypercare Process:*
      - Will begin post-UAT (trial between 7/11 and 8/1), pending go-live
      of legal entities on August 1st.

------------------------------

Summary Statement

This meeting was a critical escalation regarding UAT schedule compression,
readiness gaps, tool integration risks, and urgent expectations for process
organization and communication. Leadership has set forth a daily meeting
cadence and demanded immediate action to rectify data gaps, fully organize
testing efforts, and clarify all remaining risks ahead of UAT and legal
entity go-live. The collective message: there is no option but to deliver
on schedule, and full transparency, clarity, and cross-functional
cooperation are now demanded at the highest level.
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Sukhai0:00
She's here to definitely help this group. So with that I am going to hand
it over to Rakesh to talk about where we are, what are next steps and then
we can go from there.
Rakesh0:13
Yes. So and let me. Good morning everyone. Let me share a slide just to set
the agenda. Again, it's lit up like a Christmas tree and rightfully so. So
again Sukhai, we spoke about this last night but what you see, Jeff, Sukhai
and Vicky, is a heat map of what we've learned over the past few days and a
lot of the alignment calls between functions and it. So if you recall a few
weeks ago when we started this, we had this roadmap, you know, back in end
of April we, we would have an initial homework for teams to the kickoff and
then coming into the mid, mid May workshop we would align on a lot of
things and then take it forward in terms of readiness for 625 and then
certainly for UAT execution. So when we started off then, first thing I
want to say our UAT dates that we planned initially was 621 to 7 15. What
we've since learned over the last day or so is that the UAT dates have the
calendar shifted. What we thought there were two windows that the team gave
us, the ERP team gave on, you know, 6:23 to 7:2 and 7:11 to 7:15 were the
dates that they gave us yesterday. We were told that the UAT date window
has been shortened to just 711 to 17, 715 and that the 623 to 72 dates is
the SIT. So everything I told prior in terms of, you know, our tracker to
say, okay, there are systems in SIT or you know, systems in SIT right now
that was inaccurate because apparently it's now unit testing. So what that
brings me to this point that, you know, the calendar has shifted. So a lot
of these systems are in unit testing right now. SIT is expected to start
623 and UAT is expected to be a week 77 to 7 11. So let me take a pause
there, get your initial thoughts, reactions and then I will walk through
the rest of this as to, you know, what we have aligned things on and then
where there are gaps that we need to align on the rest.
Jeff2:41
Now Rakesh, are they saying they only.
Rakesh2:43
Need a week for the uat? That's what the ERP team told us yesterday, that
this is their plan, that they expect to complete this in a week and it will
be physical. So their initial communication to us was that there'll be two
windows, 623 to 6 will be virtual a couple of hours, two, three hours a day
where teams will come in or rather test it and then the, the 7, 7 to 711 is
physical in Morris Plains where function leads, UAT leads will be there
present to complete the testing end to end testing.
Jeff3:21
So they're still within the original window. It's just, it seems like
they're starting a little late and they've actually shortened the cycle on
it, correct?
Bill3:28
Yeah, they're compressing. That's. That's correct. And it's, it's one of
those things where, you know, given, given how tight the timeline is in
general, that compression is, is obviously going to create risk. Right.
Anything that leads past that. Right. And it's rather than say, oh, we're
still okay because the end date's okay, like I don't think any of us on
this call feel comfortable just saying, oh yeah, we're okay. So we're,
that's why we're, we're, you know, we're going through this last night said
let's make sure we have very clear view of what the status is so we can
start to, you know, push where we need to push, give support where we need
to give support, etc.
Vicki4:04
Are we clear who the, who the testers are for the uat?
Rakesh4:08
Yes, the functions have gone in and identified all of the UAT test leads.
Vicki4:15
Okay. So my only, you know, you know, thought there is, you know, we need
to have clear communication to the testers because we're also in vacation
season and my expectation would be if they're not available for test, it's,
it's on them to find a replacement, a suitable replacement. They can't just
kind of delegate that back on you guys or on Pierce. They're going to have
to work with their functional leader to find an alternate like we. There's
4,000 people in this business. I'm sure there's somebody who can step in if
the customer is not there. So. But you just gotta have that really clear
communication and you know, that's. I know Pierce is out, you know, on, on
pto, but I mean that's the piece that he's got to be driving from day one.
Rakesh5:14
Yeah, I want 150 degrees.
Vicki5:17
Yeah, Matt's got his name there. So Matt's the, We're, we'll announce him
shortly as the solstice PMO leader. So he'll help.
Rakesh5:26
Oh, welcome Matt.
Vicki5:27
Kind of be my mirror on the solstice side to help drive some of those
things.
Matt5:32
Hi everyone. So Just happy to be here. Getting rapidly up to speed. My one
question kind of being really cold, cold eyes is with the schedule
compression, do we know what the risk is where our risk points are
identified because of that compression?
Sukhai5:51
We do not. Because I literally found out last night. So I need to connect
with me and Paul need to connect with the ERP IT team under Dinesh to
better understand why we compressed it, to better understand what is the
risk and to better understand what we do to remediate it. So that is on my
to do to do today and then we'll get back to this team.
Vicki6:13
Okay, But I think, you know what you the risk is going to come from things
that are changing, right? So the ERP sound changing, it's that we're going
to go live with the entities, we're moving assets and liabilities and
we're, we'll be changing payroll, there's banking that's changing
underneath it. So the things that are changing are the things that we need
to test and because we're testing them to make sure that we don't have risk
there, but we're not adding new functionality. So I guess my question there
from the ERP side and from the business side, particularly finance, we
should have test scripts that align to what's going to be. So how are we
going to test that the bank accounts are working? How are we going to test
that the assets and liabilities wanted. How are we going to test that the
other transactions that we're assuming are not going to be impacted?
Because if the entities change and that all goes well, everything else
should just flow naturally underneath it. These are the end to end stories
or test scripts that we should be leveraging. Are all those adequately
documented?
Rakesh7:24
Before I answer part of that, Jeff, Vicki, you had your hand up as well.
Any questions?
Stephen Neal7:30
Yes, I do have a question and you know, haven't done many of these before.
You know, UAT is at one point, but before you get to UAT is a whole lot of
preparation. What is the risk of the pre activities to the UAT to get
started? That is also a risk that could push us further away. I mean, I
think that as we look at this holistically, it's great to talk about. We're
supposed to start UAT at this point, but it's not just the risk during uat,
it's the things leading up to uat. Are we prepared, are we ready? Are the
schedules there? Do we know what we're going to do logistically, et cetera.
So those are all the concerns around because if you look just at uat, you
can potentially leave a lot out of the perspective because we think, okay,
yes, we got this identified. So I would just like to understand, stand to
make sure that prior uat, we have no risk, so we don't have to think about
that so that we're not just looking at the uap.
Bill8:32
Rakesh, do you mind if I, if I answer that one?
Rakesh8:34
No, please, please.
Bill8:35
Yeah, so it's a great point, Vicki. That's the point of this. When Rakesh
started with, hey, here are all the things as far as readiness that we have
to get to so we're 100% aligned with you. There's a long, long list of
tasks that have to get addressed before for that. Everything from do we
even know what applications we're looking at? Do we have the people, as
Jeff mentioned, do we have logistics set up, do we have the test window set
up, do we have the sequence set up, the scripts, all those kinds of things,
we have the data in the systems, do we have access to the systems, do the
testers have access to the right systems, et cetera. So that's what we're
endeavoring to show here. So if you start going through this list and you
look at things like people map, process mapped, air, the SIT and UIT test,
inventory, functional reviews, logistics test, windows aligned, et cetera,
we're going through this entire list to make sure that all those items are
getting addressed because we're 100% aligned with you. And then on top of
that, what's happening is we're having the concern around the compression
and inevitably all of us know what's going to happen is tests bring up
faults or issues and those things have to get resolved and then that's
going to take time and then retest time. Right. All of us haven't been
through this. We all know what that compression means. So now, given the
fact that it's the 13th of June, what are the things we do to pull that
forward, get more time, make sure people are involved. And to Jeff's other
point about vacations and things like that, any glitch when these things
are often sequential becomes a push. And so that's what we're trying to
avoid. So to your point about prep, we're 100% with you. That's why I want
to be very open and close, clear about what we've heard over the last 24,
48 hours, etc on all these things and trying to make sure we get ahead of
it to the extent that we can.
Stephen Neal10:22
And so thanks for that background and feedback, Bill, and I appreciate
that, and I'm glad we are aligned because some of the things that I'm
looking on this chart where we're in yellow, that's supposed to be there.
There's a lot of yellow on this chart. There's a lot and then there's red.
So those. Those bring me quite a bit of concern in terms of, to your point,
getting prep. And I do know that in the last 24:48 hours has been new
learnings, new things, doing, et cetera. So you're right. We got a lot to
mitigate in terms of making this happen. So I'm glad that we all understand
that the potential of making these dates are limited.
Vicki11:04
Well, they're not limited because there's no option not to hit the dates.
Right. So even if we've got to go 247 or bring in additional people.
Stephen Neal11:14
Okay.
Vicki11:14
You know, there is. There is no moving of the state. We are going live with
the legal entities on A1. We will be ready. So now there's. There's been a
fair amount of work that's been done already by each of the functions to
think through. What do they need to test? Finance has done a pretty
detailed. I will say this needs more organization. This is. We've been
having this conversation for several weeks, and the lack of progress here
is disappointing. This isn't that hard to organize. And so I'm trying to
figure out, like, where we're getting stuck. We've got clear UAT leaders
for each function. The functions have been going through their day one
operating models. We know what's happening from an IT point of view, what's
changing. I mean, the things that are changing are well understood. So
there shouldn't be any uncertainty around what needs to be tested.
Sukhai12:13
So I'm just.
Vicki12:14
I'm at a bit of a loss of why it feels like we're so far behind where we
should be and what can I do to help? I mean, that's like, what can I do to
help? Cause this feels like we should be having very clear. Here's the
testers. This is what they're gonna test. They're gonna start on this day.
They're gonna complete their test scripts by this day. This is how we're
gonna report how well that's going. So that if there's any intervention
that I or Matt need to do with the team, we can do that with the team. I'll
have. I mean, what. What, Bill? What. What are your. Your thoughts? Right?
You kind of come into this to provide the, you know, high power ey muscle
to it. What do we need to do?
Bill13:04
I'm aligned with you. First of all, I think the organization is going to
be, I'll be very blunt with you, my primary focus now until this is cleared
or at least to the point where we feel comfortable that it's going to
clear. So that'll be, you know, my primary focus. Just so you know, my view
is we have, there's been a lot of good work done to Paul's earlier point.
We still have the, the end date that we intend to hit and we're going to
hit it, you know, as we all would agree. And then what we're going to do is
we're going to go through this list, we're going to use it as a checklist
and say what is still in the way and make sure that anything that's in the
way, we address it. If it's a people issue, if it's a decision that we
need, if it's something that we don't understand, we're gonna put that on
the table and get the right people there to understand it and just start
knocking them out one by one until we get this thing back where it needs to
be, which it needs to be green in the story. Right. And that'll be my
primary focus to work through that, the organization part of it. Like I
said, I think we were kind of clicking along. The teams are obviously very,
very busy, et cetera. Everybody knows that, understands that. So we're at a
point now. We just got it. We've got to get the issues on the table,
understand them, get the right people in the room, make the decisions we
need to make and move forward.
Vicki14:24
Yeah, I just would like to see a layer because I don't know all of the
details behind what's tested or what's changing from an IT point of view.
So Sukai, I think as you think about SIP firing into uat, right. So unit
testing I did sit is kind of a bit multi step. UAT is end to end process
testing. You know, what are the things that are changing and therefore what
are the processes that need to be tested in the uat. I would just like to
see that laid out. Very limited. I know the entities are going live or
moving assets in life like Joe. Joe's done a bunch of these things. Right.
So Joe could probably define the test breaks that he wants people to do.
You know, between Joe and Will and others on the commercial side, the ISC
side and finance side, you know, Stephen Neal and versus Stephen, Neal,
Will and John Ruder and the commercial team, Hillary and that group. What
they need to pass certainly the things that are changing, we need to test
those. I think they do penny testing for the bank accounts. So who's doing
that?
Rakesh15:47
So Jeff, from a scenario perspective the functions are ahead of them. So
they have given the scenarios. So the ERP team for example is already
developing, they have a laundry a list of test scripts that they're
developing, the functions in the alignment calls have given them. So Will
for example sent over all the scenarios they've developed, the supply chain
SRIRAM has sent over. So what SRI and the ERP team are doing is taking a
look at against what they've developed, aligning against, you know, what
needs to be newly developed, what needs to be modified, etc. So that is
well in progress and their actual internal goal is to knock it off by end
of today. So we've given them I think Monday, end of Monday, Tuesday
morning to sync back with them to see their current status. So that is well
in progress. So those scenarios translated to test scripts are well in
progress and we expect to receive those by midweek next week. The other
part we learned and so I think part of the thing then is tracking that. Now
I know pre from a tracking perspective we have tools to display that and
say OK, where are we? We have 15 scenarios defined for this process,
touching these seven systems and things just a matter of going in and then
saying ok, scenarios defined, scenarios uploaded and then executed against.
The other piece from an IT perspective, Jeff, is that, you know, they're
using this new tool tosca, relatively new, I guess it's an automation
engine that, you know, they said it's different than what they've done in
Honeywell prior. They're leveraging this tool. This is, you know, the tools
being set up and this.
Vicki17:26
Is this a regression? Like what is. I've not heard. So what is tosca? What
does it do?
Sukhai17:30
What it's using AI and it's going to do testing. I found out we were using
IT last night as well. I think it's highly risky.
Vicki17:41
It's regression testing. It's regression.
Rakesh17:44
No, it's S I T S I T Testing. Testing. Yes, it's like jira but I guess, you
know it's, it's. Yeah, it's AI based and it's automated and they, they want
everyone to use that.
Sukhai17:59
Correct. It's one of the tools that I deployed in front of Gen AI so I know
it well. I just, again, I think it's Risky. I'm going to reach out to
Dinesh because we already have condensed the timeline. Now within a
condensed timeline we're using trust up. It's just risk on this. I need to
reach out to him to better understand they may be further along on this
than I know because I've been kind of disconnected from it and come back to
this team. I think what I shared with the team last night, I think the
orchestration, the one person orchestrating all of this is not executing
well. So it's just not. And so we have got to get our arms around a very
well orchestrated machine and we don't have that. So that's one. So that's
the reason why I think it's important as Pierce gets back, he has 50 but we
get these pieces like crystal clear. Then I want to be able to see for a
particular work straight strips, have they been written? How many are they
completely done uat I mean by work stream detail, that's the other piece.
And I know I shared this with the team last night that we just don't see. I
just gotta depend on Rakeshe. We've got. Okay, you got it. So that's
perfect.
Rakesh19:10
What I'm trying to do that is again wireframe here. But this is what we
want to get onto a visibility to say okay, for every work stream, if you
will. Or in this case I put this by functions, you know, where we have the
scenarios developed, where we have the count of it, where it's automated
going into capital. It's the process track is validated. The test we've
aligned on all the test environments. That will be the QA environment.
We've aligned that the data is available in all the functional calls this
week. The next piece of this is around. You know, have we signed off on the
entry exit criteria? Have we identified the pitchers and catchers both for
an IT and a function perspective? From a process perspective, the functions
have identified the pitchers and catchers. Some are to be filled but at
least they've identified them from a systems perspective. We've got, you
know, umpteen systems that are. That are built back move as is for all of
those. And you know, have we identified the pitchers and catchers
similarly? And then you know, we. We're going to add a few more columns in
here but again, sit UAT etc. So again this is how we're planning for it to
take shape. All of this will go into a front end that will be able to
display this. The progress tracking for you Sukai very shortly.
Jeff20:26
Yeah, just make IT make this a heat map. This should be yellow.
Rakesh20:29
It is. It is, yes, it is very much a heat map. And the one other thing I do
want to show you and what we're trying to force is Jeff trying to develop
dashboards like these very quickly on smartsheets, because our IT work
plans in smartsheets, again, there's a work plan hygiene that needs to be
taken care of. But what we're doing, Mac and the team on our side have done
is, you know, develop these quick dashboards to say, okay, where is this
progression of, you know, what does my SIT schedule look like? What is my.
Vicki21:01
I'm sorry, number of UAT scenarios? Na, na, TBC Finance 51. Na, TBC, TBC.
It is unacceptable that that column is not filled out at this point. We've
been talking about UAT and talking about getting this this for four weeks.
We had the UAP kick off three or four weeks ago in Charlotte. It's
completely unacceptable for that to be incomplete at this point.
Rakesh21:31
Sorry. So this dashboard doesn't show it. It's in Capital Edge. I've not
pulled it from in for this display. Paul. Jeff, I get your point.
Vicki21:40
You can't come to this meeting. I was very clear on my expectations
yesterday of what I expected to see in this meeting. I haven't seen
anything of what I asked for and expected to see. I wanted to see where are
we on sip? Right, okay, well, now we're not even started sip. Where are we
unit testing, you know, where are we under development from an IT point of
view and then these other pieces. We can't have this conversation without
data. And if it's in Capital Edge, then why haven't we extracted it into
this? If we have all these tools, we're paying ey a lot of money for all of
these tools. If they can't provide the information, then I'm not getting
value out of that environment. Wrestling. We can't be at this point, guys,
at this point, we cannot be there. Bill, I need you. Like this is like
flaming red, flaming red alert. This needs like you need to pull in who you
need to pull in from ey to. To get this fixed. And I'm going to set up some
time. I'm going to be in Ireland next week, but I'm the seventh, so I'll
speak time. We're going to go through this and I expect this to be filled
out and clear like this doesn't take more than a couple of days to get this
sorted. We're way over complicating this, this is not that complicated of a
uat. And I don't why we keep running around the bush on this one. I just
can't figure it out.
Bill23:04
Hunter said we're on it.
Vicki23:09
Paul, what happens at 7 11? So n u A T n what happens? Right, what's, what
happens between 711 and 8 1?
Jeff23:23
Well, we're going to trial the hypercare process as we spoke about. Right.
We're going to kick that in.
Vicki23:29
Well, yeah, I know, but my submit, my question is how hard is the 11?
Because the reality where we are and a short time period. Uat, uat. If we
get really, really lucky and it's super straightforward, we get a clean
bill of health on the UAT. It's highly unlikely. With a four day UAT, if
you identify a defect on 7 7, it's probably not even going to be fixed by 7
11. It's a serious defect. We're allowing one to two cycles of testing. So
if there's anything that goes wrong on day one or someone doesn't start
their testing until day two, day three, you're not going to be complete
with the UAT by 7 11. Now maybe Dinesh is like, guys, you overthinking
this? This is falling off a lot easy. Okay. If that's his point of view,
that's, that's great. That'd be good to hear. I wouldn't be terribly
surprised. Like, we've done this kind of stuff a lot. There may not be that
bunch. It's risks that we need to mitigate. We may be confident that
everything downstream of this is going to work just fine and this is really
confirmatory. Okay, but I don't know that Supai and I could make that
argument based on our understanding. So maybe we need to get Dinesh and Joe
into this conversation to say like, you know, as they may have a different
perspective. That would cause me to think about this there. Right, but, but
we like that perspective isn't coming in here, right. Paul, you've got to
bring that perspective in. Right? Whether you bring Dinesh or Joe into this
meeting or you know yourself, you've got to bring that perspective in. What
is the risk? What are we testing? What should we be watching out for so
that we can integrate this together? But right now, this, this team is just
not winning together. Like there's just critical pieces of information that
Sukai and I need to adequately manage the risk that are not coming into
this call. So billing red purple. This has got to get fixed next, like
today, over the weekend, Monday, Tuesday, I will find some time. I'm flying
back on Thursday, certainly this Friday, next week, have this meeting
again. This has got to be completely bugged up. Every function. What are
the test scripts? We have the people. When's the UAT kickoff? Right. When
we bring those people in, what access do they need? You know, all of this
has got to be sorted out by next Friday.
Sukhai26:10
And I'm going to schedule a daily meeting because I just don't want to have
a meeting like we had last night. And unfortunately, as you all know, I
told you, he's not going to be happy. So we're having that meeting today.
So let's just meet every day, you know, just so that we make sure. I'll
bring you the national. Pinging him now, whatever other risk we bring in.
So every single day for 30 minutes, let's see where we are. So that. That
way we have a more productive next Friday than we are today. So that will
be my ass. And I'll have him to schedule that. There's a subset of the
people on this call.
Vicki26:44
Yeah, I can, you know, if you need me, I mean su. You. You've got it, you
know, under control. So. So we do have somebody. Howita just hired Jessica
Grusen, who's been helping kind of HR. She. She did all my UAPs for. For
us. She knows my expectations. I don't know if they can free her up from
her HR stuff, but I think this is all hands on deck.
Sukhai27:12
I agree. If we can bring everyone on, we got Vicki for a month. We'll take
anyone we can take at this point because again, I don't want too many
cooks. But we right now, I think we need all hands on deck. So. So yes, if
you can send her information to me and I'll make sure I connect with Hoeda
as well. That'll be much appreciated.
Vicki27:30
I'll just throw it in the chat right now.
Jeff27:32
Okay.
Vicki27:38
Okay. If you need me or you want me to look at something, I will make the
time next week to join you from. From Ireland. Other otherwise like we'll.
I'm expecting we get back together next Friday. This is a well oiled
machine. Everyone on this team is working, winning together, working
together to get this done. Pulling. You know, if you're not getting what
you need from the Solstice team, pull that in. He can help. But I don't
think that's the problem, guys. I mean, I know. I've seen what I see what
will happen. Scenarios. He had those scenarios three or four weeks ago. I
John Ruder is super on top of all this. If you've asked him to do
something, it is done. If it's not reflected here, it's because we're not
integrating that data well enough. So. All right, peace. Thank you, Sukhai.
Sukhai28:36
Thanks, guys.
Stephen Neal28:36
Bye.
Matt28:37
All right, thank you.
Vicki1:29:01
Are you able to go with me?
Bill1:29:03
Yeah, I can go with you.
Rakesh1:32:39
Why are the tornado sirens going off?
Stephen Neal1:39:56
It's.
Vicki1:42:36
What are you going to do to.
Bill1:42:37
Go get the car?

tement</h1><p>This meeting was a critical escalation regarding UAT schedule=
 compression, readiness gaps, tool integration risks, and urgent expectatio=
ns for process organization and communication. Leadership has set forth a d=
aily meeting cadence and demanded immediate action to rectify data gaps, fu=
lly organize testing efforts, and clarify all remaining risks ahead of UAT =
and legal entity go-live. The collective message: there is no option but to=
 deliver on schedule, and full transparency, clarity, and cross-functional =
cooperation are now demanded at the highest level.</p>

ust to set the agenda. Again, it&#39;s lit up like a Christmas tree and rig=
htfully so. So again Sukhai, we spoke about this last night but what you se=
e, Jeff, Sukhai and Vicky, is a heat map of what we&#39;ve learned over the=
 past few days and a lot of the alignment calls between functions and it. S=
o if you recall a few weeks ago when we started this, we had this roadmap, =
you know, back in end of April we, we would have an initial homework for te=
ams to the kickoff and then coming into the mid, mid May workshop we would =
align on a lot of things and then take it forward in terms of readiness for=
 625 and then certainly for UAT execution. So when we started off then, fir=
st thing I want to say our UAT dates that we planned initially was 621 to 7=
 15. What we&#39;ve since learned over the last day or so is that the UAT d=
ates have the calendar shifted. What we thought there were two windows that=
 the team gave us, the ERP team gave on, you know, 6:23 to 7:2 and 7:11 to =
7:15 were the dates that they gave us yesterday. We were told that the UAT =
date window has been shortened to just 711 to 17, 715 and that the 623 to 7=
2 dates is the SIT. So everything I told prior in terms of, you know, our t=
racker to say, okay, there are systems in SIT or you know, systems in SIT r=
ight now that was inaccurate because apparently it&#39;s now unit testing. =
So what that brings me to this point that, you know, the calendar has shift=
ed. So a lot of these systems are in unit testing right now. SIT is expecte=
d to start 623 and UAT is expected to be a week 77 to 7 11. So let me take =
a pause there, get your initial thoughts, reactions and then I will walk th=
rough the rest of this as to, you know, what we have aligned things on and =
then where there are gaps that we need to align on the rest.</div></div><di=

 we&#39;re going to go live with the entities, we&#39;re moving assets and =
liabilities and we&#39;re, we&#39;ll be changing payroll, there&#39;s banki=

he things that we need to test and because we&#39;re testing them to make s=
ure that we don&#39;t have risk there, but we&#39;re not adding new functio=
nality. So I guess my question there from the ERP side and from the busines=
s side, particularly finance, we should have test scripts that align to wha=
t&#39;s going to be. So how are we going to test that the bank accounts are=
 working? How are we going to test that the assets and liabilities wanted. =
How are we going to test that the other transactions that we&#39;re assumin=

 Vicki. That&#39;s the point of this. When Rakesh started with, hey, here a=
re all the things as far as readiness that we have to get to so we&#39;re 1=
00% aligned with you. There&#39;s a long, long list of tasks that have to g=
et addressed before for that. Everything from do we even know what applicat=
ions we&#39;re looking at? Do we have the people, as Jeff mentioned, do we =
have logistics set up, do we have the test window set up, do we have the se=
quence set up, the scripts, all those kinds of things, we have the data in =
the systems, do we have access to the systems, do the testers have access t=
o the right systems, et cetera. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re endeavoring to=
 show here. So if you start going through this list and you look at things =
like people map, process mapped, air, the SIT and UIT test, inventory, func=
tional reviews, logistics test, windows aligned, et cetera, we&#39;re going=
 through this entire list to make sure that all those items are getting add=
ressed because we&#39;re 100% aligned with you. And then on top of that, wh=
at&#39;s happening is we&#39;re having the concern around the compression a=
nd inevitably all of us know what&#39;s going to happen is tests bring up f=
aults or issues and those things have to get resolved and then that&#39;s g=
oing to take time and then retest time. Right. All of us haven&#39;t been t=
hrough this. We all know what that compression means. So now, given the fac=
t that it&#39;s the 13th of June, what are the things we do to pull that fo=
rward, get more time, make sure people are involved. And to Jeff&#39;s othe=
r point about vacations and things like that, any glitch when these things =

I would just like to see that laid out. Very limited. I know the entities a=

Stephen, Neal, Will and John Ruder and the commercial team, Hillary and tha=

are ahead of them. So they have given the scenarios. So the ERP team for ex=
ample is already developing, they have a laundry a list of test scripts tha=
t they&#39;re developing, the functions in the alignment calls have given t=
hem. So Will for example sent over all the scenarios they&#39;ve developed,=
 the supply chain SRIRAM has sent over. So what SRI and the ERP team are do=
ing is taking a look at against what they&#39;ve developed, aligning agains=
t, you know, what needs to be newly developed, what needs to be modified, e=
tc. So that is well in progress and their actual internal goal is to knock =
it off by end of today. So we&#39;ve given them I think Monday, end of Mond=
ay, Tuesday morning to sync back with them to see their current status. So =
that is well in progress. So those scenarios translated to test scripts are=
 well in progress and we expect to receive those by midweek next week. The =
other part we learned and so I think part of the thing then is tracking tha=
t. Now I know pre from a tracking perspective we have tools to display that=
 and say OK, where are we? We have 15 scenarios defined for this process, t=
ouching these seven systems and things just a matter of going in and then s=
aying ok, scenarios defined, scenarios uploaded and then executed against. =
The other piece from an IT perspective, Jeff, is that, you know, they&#39;r=
e using this new tool tosca, relatively new, I guess it&#39;s an automation=

 question is how hard is the 11? Because the reality where we are and a sho=
rt time period. Uat, uat. If we get really, really lucky and it&#39;s super=
 straightforward, we get a clean bill of health on the UAT. It&#39;s highly=
 unlikely. With a four day UAT, if you identify a defect on 7 7, it&#39;s p=
robably not even going to be fixed by 7 11. It&#39;s a serious defect. We&#=
39;re allowing one to two cycles of testing. So if there&#39;s anything tha=
t goes wrong on day one or someone doesn&#39;t start their testing until da=
y two, day three, you&#39;re not going to be complete with the UAT by 7 11.=
 Now maybe Dinesh is like, guys, you overthinking this? This is falling off=
 a lot easy. Okay. If that&#39;s his point of view, that&#39;s, that&#39;s =
great. That&#39;d be good to hear. I wouldn&#39;t be terribly surprised. Li=
ke, we&#39;ve done this kind of stuff a lot. There may not be that bunch. I=
t&#39;s risks that we need to mitigate. We may be confident that everything=
 downstream of this is going to work just fine and this is really confirmat=
ory. Okay, but I don&#39;t know that Supai and I could make that argument b=
ased on our understanding. So maybe we need to get Dinesh and Joe into this=
 conversation to say like, you know, as they may have a different perspecti=
ve. That would cause me to think about this there. Right, but, but we like =
that perspective isn&#39;t coming in here, right. Paul, you&#39;ve got to b=
ring that perspective in. Right? Whether you bring Dinesh or Joe into this =
meeting or you know yourself, you&#39;ve got to bring that perspective in. =
What is the risk? What are we testing? What should we be watching out for s=
o that we can integrate this together? But right now, this, this team is ju=
st not winning together. Like there&#39;s just critical pieces of informati=
on that Sukai and I need to adequately manage the risk that are not coming =
into this call. So billing red purple. This has got to get fixed next, like=
 today, over the weekend, Monday, Tuesday, I will find some time. I&#39;m f=
lying back on Thursday, certainly this Friday, next week, have this meeting=
 again. This has got to be completely bugged up. Every function. What are t=
he test scripts? We have the people. When&#39;s the UAT kickoff? Right. Whe=
n we bring those people in, what access do they need? You know, all of this=
 has got to be sorted out by next Friday.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-b=
