Meeting Summary: Separation Projects Costing =E2=80=93 Detailed DiscussionD=
ate &
Time

   - Meeting occurred prior to *Memorial Day 2024* (week of May 20)
   - Initial calls at *6:30 AM* and ongoing daily calls at *7:00 AM
   Mountain / 9:00 AM Eastern*
   - Gate-specific deliverables discussed, especially relevant for *Gate 3*
   and ongoing work toward *Gate 4*

------------------------------
Attendees

   - Corey (main presenter on costing, facilitator)
   - Mac (new team member being onboarded)
   - References to: Rakesh (client lead), Paul (client stakeholder), Arpit
   (GDS team, will assist with transition), Andrew Young and YOG (procureme=
nt
   workstream)

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Project Focus and Context

   - *Separation Projects:* Deliverables are part of the larger separation
   process for Athens from Honeywell.
   - *Primary Focus:* Identifying, estimating, and tracking IT-related
   costs associated with the separation and transition of Athens.
   - *Workstreams:* Approximately *17 workstreams* cover areas from
   Customer Experience (CCX), Commercial, Databases, to general IT
   infrastructure.

------------------------------
2. High-Level Cost Bucketsa. *One-Time Costs*

   - *Definition:* All expenses required to get Athens systems and
   infrastructure ready for "Day One" separation.
   - *Examples:* System separations, infrastructure adjustments, data
   partitioning (e.g., separating Salesforce data for Athens vs. Honeywell)=
.
   - *Budget:* Approximately *$70 million* (as per latest estimate; subject
   to iteration across gates).
   - *Process:* Teams provided estimates, mapped spend timelines, and
   execution is being tracked against budget/actuals, currently at *Gate 3*=
.

b. *Standalone Costs*

   - *Definition:* Ongoing "run" costs incurred by Athens to operate as an
   independent business, as of Day One.
   - *Components:* Software licenses, hardware, data storage, circuits,
   staffing costs (internal and external).
   - *Estimation Approaches:*
      - *Top-Down Allocation:* Honeywell=E2=80=99s IT spend (~$700 million)=
, with *$50
      million* allocated to Athens; used in earlier gates.
      - *Bottom-Up Build:* Current focus in *Gate 4* =E2=80=93 gathering gr=
anular
      cost data (e.g., actual license unit costs, quantities) for each
function.
   - *Status:* Data collection is in progress; standalone costing is a
*secondary
   priority* compared to TSA costing due to other dependencies.

c. *TSA (Transition Service Agreement) Costs*

   - *Definition:* Costs for services provided by Honeywell to Athens on or
   after Day One, until full operational separation.
   - *Process:* A detailed, bottoms-up data gathering effort, involving
   license data and vendor-specific input.
   - *Previous Submission:* Last TSA cost submitted was *$32 million* (Gate
   3).
   - *Status:* Closer to completion relative to standalone costing; many
   inputs gathered, but several categories are still awaiting final numbers=
.

d. *Stranded Costs*

   - *Definition:* Costs remaining with Honeywell after Athens=E2=80=99 sep=
aration
   that cannot be immediately removed or reallocated.
   - *Examples:* Corporate staff or licenses supporting Athens
   proportionally, but not transferable/predundant.
   - *Estimation:* Involves calculations starting with allocations,
   identifying the portion that may be "stranded," and evaluating mitigatio=
n
   potential (e.g., license right-sizing, staff redeployment, penalties).
   - *Key Stakeholders:* Procurement is heavily involved (e.g., Andrew
   Young), working to renegotiate contracts/vendor agreements.
   - *Process:* For example, if Honeywell pays $10M for SAP and Athens is
   10%, mitigation might involve license renegotiations; TSA billing covers
   part, but post-TSA, remaining =E2=80=9Cstranded=E2=80=9D costs must be a=
bsorbed or
   mitigated.
   - *Challenges:* Gathering accurate data for all lines remains difficult;
   mitigation plans are under development.

------------------------------
3. Costing Methodology

   - *Gate Structure:* Costings are done and refined at project gates (Gate
   2, 3, and now 4).
   - *Measurement & Tracking:* Status of each bucket is compared against
   models (top-down or bottom-up as appropriate).
   - *Models:* Models are kept updated as new data arrives; missing line
   items are identified and tracked for follow-up.
   - *Tools:* Cost models/summary files (Excel/Sheets) track progress and
   pending inputs for all categories.

------------------------------
4. Current Status and Challenges

   - *Data Collection:* Primary activity is collecting granular cost data
   for all buckets but particularly for TSA and Standalone costs.
   - *Data Gaps:* There remain significant data gaps, especially in the
   Standalone category. Inputs are at various stages: some fully entered,
   others received but not categorized, the rest outstanding.
   - *Dependencies:* Follow-ups with Rakesh, Paul, other leads, and
   procurement teams are ongoing to close gaps.
   - *Workload:* Teams are stretched due to concurrent separation projects,
   making data-gathering more time-consuming.

------------------------------
5. Onboarding and Next Steps for New Team Member (Mac)

   - *Immediate Tasks:* Mac to begin reviewing costing models, summary
   views, and source data once links are provided.
   - *Support Structure:* Mac will receive context and assignments from
   Rakesh and Arpit (when available). Arpit will be unavailable this week f=
or
   training but has history working with Mac.
   - *Engagement:* Mac will join daily calls, review models, begin hands-on
   inputting as soon as familiar with approach.

------------------------------
Scheduling and Logistics

   - *Daily IT Call:* 7:00 AM Mountain / 9:00 AM Eastern (entire 25-person
   IT team)
   - *Daily Standup:* 9:30 AM Eastern (deliverables/gate-focused standup).
   - *Flexibility:* Early calls preferred for now, but may be adjusted
   post-onboarding.
   - *Upcoming Meetings:* Potential in-person in New York planned for next
   week, pending Rakesh's schedule and Mac's availability.
   - *Vacation Notice:* Corey out of office next week for vacation
   (Memorial Day/school break =E2=80=93 travel to Utah, May 24=E2=80=9331 a=
pprox.).
   - *Availability:* Arpit to provide coverage/context during Corey=E2=80=
=99s
   absence; Mac to work with Arpit and Rakesh as needed.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1. *Data Collection & Follow-up:*
      - Continue to *chase down detailed cost data* across all
      functions/workstreams, especially for Standalone and TSA (Rakesh, Pau=
l,
      procurement teams).
      - Update models as new data arrives; track any outstanding/missing
      items.
      - Input newly received data into costing models and summarize.
   2. *Onboarding Tasks for Mac:*
      - Corey to *send relevant documents, links, and reading materials* to
      Mac (access via EY/Honeywell SharePoint).
      - Mac to review background materials, begin learning the cost input
      process, and prepare questions.
      - Mac to start inputting data into the models as appropriate.
   3. *Meeting Participation:*
      - Mac to join all relevant daily calls and gate deliverable standups.
      - Prepare for early calls (6:30=E2=80=937:30 AM Mountain as needed fo=
r now).
   4. *Scheduling/Coordination:*
      - Coordinate with Rakesh for detailed onboarding, role clarification,
      and roadmap for supporting costing efforts.
      - Plan handover/coverage during Corey=E2=80=99s vacation week.
   5. *Procurement Follow-ups:*
      - Andrew Young, YOG, and procurement to continue working with vendors
      to identify possible license right-sizing/mitigations for Stranded Co=
sts.

------------------------------
Follow-ups & Future Meetings

   - *Next Steps:* Rapid onboarding of Mac so he can meaningfully
   contribute ahead of Corey=E2=80=99s vacation.
   - *Early Calls:* Stand up initial early calls per the agreed schedule.
   Revisit time slots as needed once team is stable.
   - *New York Meeting:* Pending confirmation for in-person strategy
   meeting with Rakesh next week.
   - *Arpit Engagement:* Use Arpit=E2=80=99s GDS knowledge=E2=80=94he will =
bridge context
   for Mac during Corey=E2=80=99s vacation.
   - *Ongoing Status Review:* Continue daily standups and integrate Mac
   into reporting/data entry procedure.
   - *Documentation:* Corey to send summary links and model references for
   Mac=E2=80=99s self-study.

------------------------------
Key Figures and Dates

   - *One Time Cost Estimate:* ~$70 million
   - *Allocated Honeywell IT Spend to Athens:* $50 million (from $700
   million total)
   - *TSA Cost (prior submission):* $32 million
   - *Vacation (Corey):* Week of May 24=E2=80=9331 (first week kids out of =
school,
   Memorial Day holiday)
   - *Daily Calls:* 7:00 AM Mountain / 9:00 AM Eastern; standup at 9:30 AM
   Eastern

------------------------------
Notes

   - Many cost estimates are still being refined, with bottom-up analysis
   replacing previous high-level allocations, particularly for Gate 4
   submissions.
   - The process is highly iterative and relies heavily on follow-up,
   vendor negotiations, and ongoing communication between different workstr=
eam
   leads.
   - Mitigation of stranded costs is a high priority for Honeywell,
   especially after TSA agreements expire.
   - The next few days are critical for onboarding and closing data gaps
   before Corey's scheduled absence for vacation.

Corey0:00
You are now connected. You can merge your calls when ready on their
separation projects and everything for it. The main focus is these
deliverables here and TSA has a lot going on with it, but this is
specifically costing. And so back in September I believe it was Rakesh and
a few others developed some high level views of a one time cost, a
standalone cost and a stranded cost. And then a little later we developed a
first view at TSA costs as well. So like you said, I mean I'll just give
you like a five year old version of this and we can breeze over it if you
have context or have some idea on it. If not we can talk more about it. But
the one time cost work stream is like all the projects to get Athens ready
for day one. And that means like getting either systems or infrastructure
either physically or logically separated to prepare for either a TSA or for
Athens to perform a specific function or use a to host their own
application or something like that. So an example of that would be
Salesforce, let's say that will be a TSA on day one. But they do need to do
some work ahead of time to make sure that they can have the data separated
between Honeywell and Athens. And so all the teams, I think there's about
17 work streams or something between all the way from CCX or customer
experience or commercial to database and some other infrastructure work
streams. They all created one time cost estimates and we collected those
and put them on a calendar on what that spend would look like and it's
about, what is it, 70 million. And that's been, we've iterated on that over
the, over the different gates but they're currently executing those day one
separation projects against this one time cost budget. And currently we're
like it says here in gate three and on we're tracking the spend on those
projects based on, you know, budget versus actuals. And so that's kind of
where we're at now. It's going to be more of that as we go on just
tracking, making sure the projects are being executed and spending
according to plan and making sure they're adjusting any budgets accordingly=
.
Mac3:04
Cool.
Corey3:06
Any questions on that one?
Mac3:08
Nope.
Corey3:11
Yeah, we can, I can, I'll show you more context on these to help you better
visualize these in a minute. But just as an overview, that's, that's
basically one time cost. A standalone cost is run costs. So it's what
Athens it will need to run the business on day one or standalone could mean
at different time periods. But the way we're looking at it right now is a
day one view. So you know, it's the same across all the work streams. What
they, what they need to, you know, for licensing, what kind of software
licenses will they need? What kind of hardware do they need to either host
or store data or you know, circuits and that all, whatever it is, as well
as personnel costs and external, external personnel costs, you know, all
those different buckets all together per function. So it's getting what
it's going to cost on day one. And so with that one as well, we've iterated
on that one. And for standalone and TSA cost we've used an allocation
approach. So overall IT spend for Honeywell is like 700 million and they've
allocated I think 50 million of that to Athens. And so for the standalone,
Athens has its own costs, you know, things that it pays to vendors itself
or has its own people that are dedicated to that line of business. And then
Honeywell also has like a corporate it, you know, kind of a peanut butter
spread across all the different businesses. And so that's their, that's
their baseline of like whatever corporate allocates to Athens and then
whatever they spend themselves. And then to build it back up we take
whatever's like existing Athens that's going to just move as is over to the
new company and then anyone else from corporate or other business lines
that are also moving to Athens, plus any TSA costs, you know, things that
are eventually going to make it over there but aren't ready to do. So day
one there's a TSA and then any like, oh, can't touch that, sorry, there we
go. And so, and then any like additional people they need to hire,
additional software, they need that kind of thing. All those come together
to make a standalone estimate. Okay, so we did that first with an
allocation, allocation view. And so we have a, I can get a quick, quick
view of it. Honeywell has like, you know, has a view on allocations, you
know that 50 million that I mentioned allocated to Athens, they have it
organized pretty well, but not to the level of detail where we can just.
Oh, it's not in here, sorry. It's a good starting place but it's not super
accurate. So it's what they think they spent on Athens today. And it's a
top down view. And so that's what we did in previous gates and now in gate
four. We are, we are now looking at a, Sorry, where'd it go? A bottoms up
view on this. So it's a bottoms up here. No it doesn't, but we're doing a
bottoms up. So we're getting like all the licensing costs that they've
negotiated with the vendors. So then we know that it's going to be, you
know, 3,500 people times a hundred dollars a license a month. We use that
to build up a cost for each, each function. And so that's, that's kind of
where we're at. We're in the middle of that process for both for standalone
and TSA as a bottom bottoms up build.
Mac7:37
Okay.
Corey7:41
Any, any questions on that so far?
Mac7:44
No, I mean that makes sense. So what are you doing? Just collecting. Like,
do you have a good idea of where the gaps are or like where you need to
fill in the detail as you said, like, is your like primary focus right now
driving on that, like chasing down all of the detailed cost data?
Corey8:06
Yeah, that's it. Right. And it's not like something functions for this
round. It's not like someone can just go find it. A lot of times they
either they have to estimate it and use new data or come up with it. So
it's a little more time consuming for them, a little trickier. And now that
everyone's really busy with the project, no one seems to have time, time
for this, which is understandable, but you know, makes it a little tough to
get everything together. So we do have a good, a good view on what gaps we
have and we have, you know, followed up with Rakesh and Paul, who's the
client to, to communicate those and we're just kind of waiting to hear back
on those and see the data. Yeah, so like if I give you, let's look at, I go
here, this is the file for our standalone cost model for gate four, for
gate three, gate two and gate three. We have a summary of costs here. So
this right here is what we submitted last time for our one time cost. And
it's combined, you see like a standalone cost here and then a TSA cost here
in a total. And that's because the view we're creating is a day one view.
And on day one it's not just the standalone cost or just a tsa, it's both.
Anything that the business is supporting fully, the Athens is supporting
fully is captured here and then anything that's on the TSA for day one is
here. So we, we submitted a number that's kind of everything to show what
their all in cost on day one would be. And then further down the road, you
know, like on a, on a day two or you know when things are completely off
TSA or there's been some level of synergies captured a standalone cost is
also, they also kind of, that's also typical but not what we're pulling up
today.
Mac10:21
Okay.
Corey10:22
What we're working on today. So yeah, these were, these were done with a
top down method. And now for Gate three we've asked the functions to, let
me give an example here. We've asked the functions to do the exercise from
bottoms up. And so, you know, in some cases for all the hardware and
software, for example, they've gone in and analyzed what they've used or
specific license counts times dollar per license, you know, so they're
pretty specific on the cost that the teams have added here. And this for
example is just going to plug in similar to this one. So this is just the
digital employee experience function that's just going to plug in for that
function for gate 4 as this number, for example.
Mac11:23
Cool.
Corey11:24
And so we have a few of those built out. Some are ready, most are not. And
yeah, we're just trying to drive towards completion for these and
collecting data. I would say standalone is kind of a second priority next
to TSA right now. Tsa, there's you know, exit planning and other activities
that are happening that are, that have at least have some dependency on the
costing for the TSA run. And so that's been kind of the bigger focus thus
far in getting the data. So we're a lot closer with getting all the inputs
for TSA costing. Okay, sweet. And we're still a ways off. And you know,
actually there's a lot of blanks here. As you can see. This is probably our
summary view of the model. But that's not to say all these are just we
don't have anything for a lot of these are close and we're waiting on like
a few licensing costs or a few support costs for each of these. So it's not
as empty, it's not as far off as it looks here. But this is kind of our
summary view that we have for each category of the different buckets. And a
reference of like this is that the TSA cost that we submitted last time at
32 million. So anyway, that's kind of a high level of those costing
buckets. So one time standalone and TSA and the last one is Stranded and
that's Stranded is a Honeywell cost that is like once if they have 100
people that are supporting Honeywell as a whole and the equivalent of 15
FTE support Athens. But those are corporate employees and they're going to
stay with Honeywell once Athens leaves, what are they going to do? And
those are like, without mitigation, those people are stranded cost. And so
the activity is to identify first the stranded costs, those 15 employees,
what they cost, and then the next activity is a mitigation plan. So if it's
as simple as, well, we're just going to reallocate them to other businesses
or we're going to send some of them to Athens or, you know, we're going to
let people go, whatever that is. Those are all mitigations to what the
stranded cost is for Honeywell.
Mac14:12
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. So those are cost to Honeywell, right? The
stranded costs.
Corey14:19
Yes. Yep, yep.
Mac14:21
Okay.
Corey14:23
And I'll pull up our model here. And this one has been a little tougher to
get more data on. So we're kind of, we have a model where we again, start
with our allocations for each of the functions and then based on, you know,
if we take like SAP is a big one. If Honeywell has a license with
Honeywell, that's, I don't know, 10 million a year. And if Athens
represents 10% of that, how are they going to mitigate that? Are they going
to be able to negotiate with the SAP to get a 10% smaller license to like,
account for those that are people that are leaving licenses that they won't
use? That's, that's kind of like a big question for all the, all the
licensing costs for applications. And so procurement is a function. And
Andrew Young and YOG and our team are on that work stream identifying those
costs and trying to like, work with vendors and negotiate those terms so
that they can either right. Size the Honeywell contract or transfer
licenses to a new contract for Athens or something like that. And so we
have an estimate of what Athens spend is. And if Athens leaves, you know,
Honeywell would be left with this 5 million allocation for ERP through TSAs
for the first, you know, first six months or year. We have the one
mitigation is TSA costs because they get to build those out. And there's
also in this grouping a cost for procurement mitigation here. So that's
where procurement has identified. Yeah, we can right size and license. We
can move them over without any penalty or, you know, if there's a penalty,
that's included here too. But basically it's, you know, this, minus this
issue, this to get to a real stranded cost.
Mac16:38
Okay.
Corey16:41
And, you know, that's, that's all broken down here. If I go to ERP for This
first one, we have a stranded cost. This our corporate allocation, which is
5 million for. For Honeywell. And then we have some line items in here that
some are blank because we don't have data yet. But these are all
mitigations that wouldn't. That would. That would reduce the overall impact
of stranded cost. And so, you know, if there's a SAP license that they can
renegotiate, that's the line item here. If there's, you know, similar to
the other buckets, there's something they can do for these that's a net
change that we can add here. The billing right now is like the big one. So
the tsa, TSA billing will mitigate some of the stranded costs, not all of
it. And, you know, after that TSA ends, that's when the real, like the
heavy piece of that strain of cost hits. And unless there's some other
mitigation here, it's going to be a lot to take in for Honeywell.
Mac17:50
So that's cost we have.
Corey17:53
Yeah, sorry, you said, you said it.
Mac17:57
Will be a lot to take in for Highway. What will be that cost?
Corey18:02
Yeah, right. So, I mean, if they're paying 500,000 for Athens right now,
and once the TSA ends here, if they're only getting, like, mitigating, you
know, 15% of that, they're just going to eat the rest of this amount here.
So it'd be, you know, 362k a month just for the ERP work stream that they'd
have to pay out basically as a, as a lost, you know, sunk cost. Unless
there's some other methods to reduce that. Yeah.
Mac18:33
Yep, yep. Okay.
Corey18:37
So anyway, that's a lot. That's a lot of, like, stuff to take in. But, you
know, those four buckets is basically what our scope is from a costing
perspective. And yeah, we're writing gate for refining and getting data and
tracking for one time, cost. So that's a lot of words, a lot of things
said. So. But that's where we're at. We can dive into more detail on these
in the coming days to get you up to speed. But. But that's generally where
we are and we're in a data collection phase for most of these right now.
Mac19:22
Good. Dope. Yeah, this is really helpful and I'm definitely fine with
having. I think we should definitely get those early calls. Sorry. We
should definitely get those early calls going. I have no problem with the
6:30. I think it's good. I just wanted to at least have our first initial
few when I'M awake and like on rather than the morning. So, like, I think
once we have like a roadmap of like where I can plug in and what needs to
get done, that's fine. We can, we can stand that up and use that to sort of
like set the agenda for the day. So from here I think I'm going to look for
guidance from Rakesh on specifically what to support. And then potentially
he wanted to meet in New York next week, which I think would be good. And
I'm not sure. Where are you located again? I'm sorry.
Corey20:30
Yeah, I'm in Dallas, but next week I am out of office.
Mac20:34
Okay, that's fine. So we'll try and get stood up this week then. Do you
want to?
Corey20:43
Yeah, and I think.
Mac20:45
Yeah, go ahead.
Corey20:47
No, I was just going to say, yeah, I mean, there's Arpit as well, who's on
the GDS team, who has some context and has been involved in the process,
especially the last few weeks. And so I think we can get up to speed on
where we're at and I can get you all the details and, and documents and
everything. And then certainly next week Rakesh and Arpit have context to,
you know, get you in full swing. But yeah, this was certainly.
Mac21:17
Yeah, I know Arpit. Him and I worked on it. Yeah, we were on healthcare
together. So I know Arpit, so that will be good. We'll probably spend as
much time then this week as possible getting going. What are you, what are
you doing next week? Are you vacation or something?
Corey21:34
Yeah, yeah, I'm on vacation.
Mac21:36
That's sick.
Corey21:36
That's good. Yeah.
Mac21:39
Yeah, I guess with the holiday, it does make sense. This really snuck up on
me. I, I feel like I always thought Memorial Day weekend was like the
first. I thought Memorial Day was like the. I don't know, I thought it
would be next weekend. I guess I'm surprised. I guess the way the calendar
falls this year, it's a little bit early. So this really, really snuck up
on me. People were asking, like, what are you doing for Memorial Day
weekend? I'm like, isn't that two weeks away? No, wrong. So. Well, that's
good.
Corey22:11
Yeah. Yeah, I'm, I'm, you know, obviously it's not the best timing, but
yeah, I'll be off just that week. We're taking, the kids are out of school
on this Friday and, and then, you know, so we're, we're taking that first
week off and we're going to like southern Utah to Zion's national park and,
you know, doing some Golfing and all sorts of fun stuff so it should be a
hoot. But yeah I think we can, we can get a lot of time together this the
next couple of days and get you up to speed and get you going.
Mac22:48
Yep, yep, definitely tactically I guess like what's next? Like what are
your priorities for this week? It sounded like there's a lot of information
that you're waiting for sort of trying to chase down where are we at? Like
what's your tactical list look like?
Corey23:11
Yeah so yeah the one thing on like schedule and stuff, just logistics. So
there was that one early call this morning that is the overall SML call for
it for our team tomorrow. It's, it's, it's at seven your time or nine
Eastern and so that's the daily call for everyone so that's like the whole
25 person IT team and then right after that so at 9:30 Eastern is when we
have like our gate deliverables connection and so that's our like daily
stand up for that. So just tactically I think like the daily, the daily
stand up is going to be early for, for Mountain time and you know if, if
the, the 7:30 mountain time call is too early that's, that's you know we
can push that out too. That's one of the big deals.
Mac24:06
No, it's good now. It's good now. Like I, I, yeah it's, it's definitely
fine I think going forward and I don't know is there a call is Arpit
usually on at that point?
Corey24:22
He, he is but he is, but he's not even, he's doing a training this week so
he won't be in this week but yeah we'll, we'll talk about like honestly the
later the better for me too. I, this, this Monday morning 7:30 call catches
me off guard and I, I'd like to push it back but anyway yeah so we can, we
can talk about schedule but that's that, that's what it is currently and as
far as like next steps or what I'm what I'm high priorities are right now.
Yeah it's like it's pushing our you know Rakesh and team to help us out
getting, getting data sources and follow and following up with all the, all
the leads that still owe us stuff. So that's been a constant thing and
where we have gotten data it's making sure that we have input into the
models or we have any questions that we're following up on those. So I'm
you know for A lot of them, we have them in the model. There's, there's
another, I'd say like for tsa, there's probably about a third that's input
into the model. There's a, there's probably a little less than a third
that's we have and that we need to like categorize or like, you know,
figure out how to input that. And then there's the rest that we're waiting
on. So you know, it's just working through each stage of that data there
and then for standalone it's just like a little, we have, we have less of
each and more of more. Outstanding. So yeah, that's, that's kind of where
that's at and yeah, so just in various stages there.
Mac26:06
Okay, sweet. What's the best way for me to get plugged in? I guess.
Corey26:15
I think probably the best way, I mean I think any, any like follow ups
obviously doesn't make sense for you to do, but for some of the things that
we have kind of that we received that need to be input, we can, we can
maybe talk about that tomorrow morning and.
Mac26:36
Kind.
Corey26:37
Of get a lay of the land of how we've been inputting it and what, you know,
if we have like an email or if there's a sheet that, that needs to be
input, we can maybe get, just get you up to speed to be able to add those
in and get those areas finalized and everything. So maybe that's the best,
best way to get you involved there.
Mac27:01
Cool. Yeah, that would be awesome.
Corey27:05
Cool. Alrighty.
Mac27:08
Okay, cool. Well, thank you, Corey.
Corey27:10
Talk to your.
Mac27:12
Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean this is great. I'm really looking forward to
it and I definitely want to help out as much as I can. If you have links to
any of these things just for me to peruse through or start to peruse
through, I think that would be really helpful too. So I can try and get a
land and then once I'm in it it will be easier to ask questions. So forgive
probably a lot of dumb questions at first, but I would love to just have
some reading materials, homework that I can page through and start to get
my head around it.
Corey27:43
Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah. And that's, you know, getting up to speed
especially on a new like because the costing for me is I've done a little
bit of it here and there, but not as like my work stream. So it's, it was
new to me at the beginning of this project too. So I know there's a lot of,
there's a lot of things that you don't. You. You're not gonna. You're not
gonna. It's. It's not. It's not intuitive in some cases. So it's. Yeah, I
expect a lot of questions and so no. No big deal there.
Mac28:13
Cool.
Corey28:14
Yeah. I'll send you a bunch of links and you don't have. I'm sure you have.
Ey. SharePoint access, but not Honeywell. Is that right?
Mac28:26
I've got Honeywell. Yeah. I've got both.
Corey28:29
No way. That's a really good time. Okay.
Mac28:31
I know.
Corey28:32
That makes it so much easier. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll get. I'll get a sheet
together with all the links and stuff and so you can start looking through
those and getting up to speed.
Mac28:45
Okay, Sounds great. Amazing.
Corey28:49
Awesome, Mac. Thanks, man.
Mac28:51
Cool. Thanks, man.
Corey28:53
We'll see you here at the end of the day. Call.
Mac28:55
Yeah, definitely. Let's do it. Thanks so much.
Corey28:58
Alrighty. Thanks. All right, bye.

t; separation.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Examples:</strong> System separation=

ce data for Athens vs. Honeywell).</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Budget:</strong> Approximately <stro=
ng style=3D"font-weight:bold">$70 million</strong> (as per latest estimate;=
 subject to iteration across gates).</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Process:</strong> Teams provided est=

<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Definition:</strong> Ongoing &quot;r=
un&quot; costs incurred by Athens to operate as an independent business, as=
 of Day One.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Components:</strong> Software licens=
es, hardware, data storage, circuits, staffing costs (internal and external=

 with Honeywell after Athens=E2=80=99 separation that cannot be immediately=
 removed or reallocated.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Examples:</strong> Corporate staff o=
r licenses supporting Athens proportionally, but not transferable/predundan=
t.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Estimation:</strong> Involves calcul=
ations starting with allocations, identifying the portion that may be &quot=
;stranded,&quot; and evaluating mitigation potential (e.g., license right-s=
izing, staff redeployment, penalties).</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key Stakeholders:</strong> Procureme=
nt is heavily involved (e.g., Andrew Young), working to renegotiate contrac=
ts/vendor agreements.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Process:</strong> For example, if Ho=
neywell pays $10M for SAP and Athens is 10%, mitigation might involve licen=
se renegotiations; TSA billing covers part, but post-TSA, remaining =E2=80=
=9Cstranded=E2=80=9D costs must be absorbed or mitigated.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Challenges:</strong> Gathering accur=

 Status of each bucket is compared against models (top-down or bottom-up as=

tivity is collecting granular cost data for all buckets but particularly fo=
r TSA and Standalone costs.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Data Gaps:</strong> There remain sig=

ected. You can merge your calls when ready on their separation projects and=
 everything for it. The main focus is these deliverables here and TSA has a=
 lot going on with it, but this is specifically costing. And so back in Sep=
tember I believe it was Rakesh and a few others developed some high level v=
iews of a one time cost, a standalone cost and a stranded cost. And then a =
little later we developed a first view at TSA costs as well. So like you sa=
id, I mean I&#39;ll just give you like a five year old version of this and =
we can breeze over it if you have context or have some idea on it. If not w=
e can talk more about it. But the one time cost work stream is like all the=
 projects to get Athens ready for day one. And that means like getting eith=
er systems or infrastructure either physically or logically separated to pr=
epare for either a TSA or for Athens to perform a specific function or use =
a to host their own application or something like that. So an example of th=
at would be Salesforce, let&#39;s say that will be a TSA on day one. But th=
ey do need to do some work ahead of time to make sure that they can have th=
e data separated between Honeywell and Athens. And so all the teams, I thin=
k there&#39;s about 17 work streams or something between all the way from C=
CX or customer experience or commercial to database and some other infrastr=
ucture work streams. They all created one time cost estimates and we collec=
ted those and put them on a calendar on what that spend would look like and=
 it&#39;s about, what is it, 70 million. And that&#39;s been, we&#39;ve ite=
rated on that over the, over the different gates but they&#39;re currently =
executing those day one separation projects against this one time cost budg=
et. And currently we&#39;re like it says here in gate three and on we&#39;r=
e tracking the spend on those projects based on, you know, budget versus ac=
tuals. And so that&#39;s kind of where we&#39;re at now. It&#39;s going to =
be more of that as we go on just tracking, making sure the projects are bei=
ng executed and spending according to plan and making sure they&#39;re adju=
sting any budgets accordingly.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;=

 I can, I&#39;ll show you more context on these to help you better visualiz=
e these in a minute. But just as an overview, that&#39;s, that&#39;s basica=
lly one time cost. A standalone cost is run costs. So it&#39;s what Athens =
it will need to run the business on day one or standalone could mean at dif=
ferent time periods. But the way we&#39;re looking at it right now is a day=
 one view. So you know, it&#39;s the same across all the work streams. What=
 they, what they need to, you know, for licensing, what kind of software li=
censes will they need? What kind of hardware do they need to either host or=
 store data or you know, circuits and that all, whatever it is, as well as =
personnel costs and external, external personnel costs, you know, all those=
 different buckets all together per function. So it&#39;s getting what it&#=
39;s going to cost on day one. And so with that one as well, we&#39;ve iter=
ated on that one. And for standalone and TSA cost we&#39;ve used an allocat=
ion approach. So overall IT spend for Honeywell is like 700 million and the=
y&#39;ve allocated I think 50 million of that to Athens. And so for the sta=
ndalone, Athens has its own costs, you know, things that it pays to vendors=
 itself or has its own people that are dedicated to that line of business. =
And then Honeywell also has like a corporate it, you know, kind of a peanut=
 butter spread across all the different businesses. And so that&#39;s their=
, that&#39;s their baseline of like whatever corporate allocates to Athens =
and then whatever they spend themselves. And then to build it back up we ta=
ke whatever&#39;s like existing Athens that&#39;s going to just move as is =
over to the new company and then anyone else from corporate or other busine=
ss lines that are also moving to Athens, plus any TSA costs, you know, thin=
gs that are eventually going to make it over there but aren&#39;t ready to =
do. So day one there&#39;s a TSA and then any like, oh, can&#39;t touch tha=
t, sorry, there we go. And so, and then any like additional people they nee=
d to hire, additional software, they need that kind of thing. All those com=
e together to make a standalone estimate. Okay, so we did that first with a=
n allocation, allocation view. And so we have a, I can get a quick, quick v=
iew of it. Honeywell has like, you know, has a view on allocations, you kno=
w that 50 million that I mentioned allocated to Athens, they have it organi=
zed pretty well, but not to the level of detail where we can just. Oh, it&#=
39;s not in here, sorry. It&#39;s a good starting place but it&#39;s not su=
per accurate. So it&#39;s what they think they spent on Athens today. And i=
t&#39;s a top down view. And so that&#39;s what we did in previous gates an=
d now in gate four. We are, we are now looking at a, Sorry, where&#39;d it =
go? A bottoms up view on this. So it&#39;s a bottoms up here. No it doesn&#=
39;t, but we&#39;re doing a bottoms up. So we&#39;re getting like all the l=
icensing costs that they&#39;ve negotiated with the vendors. So then we kno=
w that it&#39;s going to be, you know, 3,500 people times a hundred dollars=
 a license a month. We use that to build up a cost for each, each function.=
 And so that&#39;s, that&#39;s kind of where we&#39;re at. We&#39;re in the=
 middle of that process for both for standalone and TSA as a bottom bottoms=
 up build.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgro=

new data or come up with it. So it&#39;s a little more time consuming for t=
hem, a little trickier. And now that everyone&#39;s really busy with the pr=
oject, no one seems to have time, time for this, which is understandable, b=
ut you know, makes it a little tough to get everything together. So we do h=
ave a good, a good view on what gaps we have and we have, you know, followe=
d up with Rakesh and Paul, who&#39;s the client to, to communicate those an=
d we&#39;re just kind of waiting to hear back on those and see the data. Ye=
ah, so like if I give you, let&#39;s look at, I go here, this is the file f=
or our standalone cost model for gate four, for gate three, gate two and ga=
te three. We have a summary of costs here. So this right here is what we su=
bmitted last time for our one time cost. And it&#39;s combined, you see lik=
e a standalone cost here and then a TSA cost here in a total. And that&#39;=
s because the view we&#39;re creating is a day one view. And on day one it&=
#39;s not just the standalone cost or just a tsa, it&#39;s both. Anything t=
hat the business is supporting fully, the Athens is supporting fully is cap=
tured here and then anything that&#39;s on the TSA for day one is here. So =
we, we submitted a number that&#39;s kind of everything to show what their =
all in cost on day one would be. And then further down the road, you know, =
like on a, on a day two or you know when things are completely off TSA or t=
here&#39;s been some level of synergies captured a standalone cost is also,=
 they also kind of, that&#39;s also typical but not what we&#39;re pulling =
up today.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgrou=

 functions to, let me give an example here. We&#39;ve asked the functions t=
o do the exercise from bottoms up. And so, you know, in some cases for all =
the hardware and software, for example, they&#39;ve gone in and analyzed wh=
at they&#39;ve used or specific license counts times dollar per license, yo=
u know, so they&#39;re pretty specific on the cost that the teams have adde=

So this is just the digital employee experience function that&#39;s just go=

">And so we have a few of those built out. Some are ready, most are not. An=
d yeah, we&#39;re just trying to drive towards completion for these and col=
lecting data. I would say standalone is kind of a second priority next to T=
SA right now. Tsa, there&#39;s you know, exit planning and other activities=
 that are happening that are, that have at least have some dependency on th=
e costing for the TSA run. And so that&#39;s been kind of the bigger focus =
thus far in getting the data. So we&#39;re a lot closer with getting all th=
e inputs for TSA costing. Okay, sweet. And we&#39;re still a ways off. And =
you know, actually there&#39;s a lot of blanks here. As you can see. This i=
s probably our summary view of the model. But that&#39;s not to say all the=
se are just we don&#39;t have anything for a lot of these are close and we&=
#39;re waiting on like a few licensing costs or a few support costs for eac=
h of these. So it&#39;s not as empty, it&#39;s not as far off as it looks h=
ere. But this is kind of our summary view that we have for each category of=
 the different buckets. And a reference of like this is that the TSA cost t=
hat we submitted last time at 32 million. So anyway, that&#39;s kind of a h=
igh level of those costing buckets. So one time standalone and TSA and the =
last one is Stranded and that&#39;s Stranded is a Honeywell cost that is li=
ke once if they have 100 people that are supporting Honeywell as a whole an=
d the equivalent of 15 FTE support Athens. But those are corporate employee=
s and they&#39;re going to stay with Honeywell once Athens leaves, what are=
 they going to do? And those are like, without mitigation, those people are=
 stranded cost. And so the activity is to identify first the stranded costs=
, those 15 employees, what they cost, and then the next activity is a mitig=
ation plan. So if it&#39;s as simple as, well, we&#39;re just going to real=
locate them to other businesses or we&#39;re going to send some of them to =
Athens or, you know, we&#39;re going to let people go, whatever that is. Th=
ose are all mitigations to what the stranded cost is for Honeywell.</div></=

as been a little tougher to get more data on. So we&#39;re kind of, we have=
 a model where we again, start with our allocations for each of the functio=
ns and then based on, you know, if we take like SAP is a big one. If Honeyw=
ell has a license with Honeywell, that&#39;s, I don&#39;t know, 10 million =
a year. And if Athens represents 10% of that, how are they going to mitigat=
e that? Are they going to be able to negotiate with the SAP to get a 10% sm=
aller license to like, account for those that are people that are leaving l=
icenses that they won&#39;t use? That&#39;s, that&#39;s kind of like a big =
question for all the, all the licensing costs for applications. And so proc=
urement is a function. And Andrew Young and YOG and our team are on that wo=
rk stream identifying those costs and trying to like, work with vendors and=
 negotiate those terms so that they can either right. Size the Honeywell co=
ntract or transfer licenses to a new contract for Athens or something like =
that. And so we have an estimate of what Athens spend is. And if Athens lea=
ves, you know, Honeywell would be left with this 5 million allocation for E=
RP through TSAs for the first, you know, first six months or year. We have =
the one mitigation is TSA costs because they get to build those out. And th=
ere&#39;s also in this grouping a cost for procurement mitigation here. So =
that&#39;s where procurement has identified. Yeah, we can right size and li=
cense. We can move them over without any penalty or, you know, if there&#39=
;s a penalty, that&#39;s included here too. But basically it&#39;s, you kno=
w, this, minus this issue, this to get to a real stranded cost.</div></div>=

hat some are blank because we don&#39;t have data yet. But these are all mi=

input into the models or we have any questions that we&#39;re following up =
on those. So I&#39;m you know for A lot of them, we have them in the model.=
 There&#39;s, there&#39;s another, I&#39;d say like for tsa, there&#39;s pr=
obably about a third that&#39;s input into the model. There&#39;s a, there&=
#39;s probably a little less than a third that&#39;s we have and that we ne=

then there&#39;s the rest that we&#39;re waiting on. So you know, it&#39;s =
just working through each stage of that data there and then for standalone =
it&#39;s just like a little, we have, we have less of each and more of more=
