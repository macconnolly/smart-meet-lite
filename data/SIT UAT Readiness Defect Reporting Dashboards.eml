Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 13, 2025Attendees

Key voices include Rakesh, Bill, Srinivas, Anne, Mac, Audrey, and
references to Jeff, Sukai, Pierce, Caesar, Steve, and others.
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *SIT & UAT Schedules and Milestones**System
Integration Testing (SIT)*

   - *Unit Testing* is currently ongoing and will continue until June 23.
   - *End-to-End SIT* is scheduled for:
      - *Start:* Week of June 23, 2025
      - *End:* July 2, 2025 (Wednesday)
      - SIT may extend as needed up to July 4 to align with system close
      dates.
   - *Parallel Testing:* Not all development (especially form outputs) will
   complete before SIT begins. Some elements, such as contract creation for=
ms,
   will be completed during SIT.

*User Acceptance Testing (UAT)*

   - *Onsite UAT:* Scheduled for July 7=E2=80=9311, 2025 (Monday=E2=80=93Fr=
iday).
   - There was clarification that earlier planned virtual UAT sessions (2=
=E2=80=933
   hours) are not main UAT events; the primary UAT window is July 7=E2=80=
=9311.
   - Approximately one week is allocated for UAT, matching original
   expectations.

*Future Rollouts*

   - *Ireland* go-live: August 25, 2025
   - *Saudi and UAE:* Projected for September 29, 2025
      - Acknowledged need for multiple UAT cycles around these regional
      go-lives.

------------------------------
2. *Defect Tracking & Reporting Tools*

   - *Primary Tool:*
      - *Tricentis Tosca* chosen for test automation, defect capture, and
      reporting during SIT and UAT.
      - *JIRA* is not explicitly confirmed as the defect repository;
      typical usage acknowledged, but the current project is driving toward=
 an
      automation-led process.
   - *Access & Reporting:*
      - Weekly reporting required, particularly to fulfill Jeff=E2=80=99s r=
equest
      for visibility into defects and project status.
      - Plan to onboard business and IT participants into Tosca.
   - *Broader Integration:*
      - Desire to use Tosca=E2=80=99s automation not only for project execu=
tion but
      also to leverage in future physical separations (e.g., upcoming
LA event).
   - *Manual Backups / Supplements:*
      - Use of Smartsheets to track progress, SIT/UAT start/end dates, and
      inventory per system.
      - Plans underway to automate reporting through BI dashboards built on
      Smartsheets data.
      - Short-term manual updates (daily/regular Excel, status reports)
      expected until automation and tool integration mature.

------------------------------
3. *Test Scenarios and Script Management*

   - *Business Involvement:*
      - Business teams are maintaining scenario trackers for validation,
      expected to break down by subprocess, system touchpoint, and
scenario count.
      - Each system=E2=80=99s test script list to be finalized; *target to =
have all
      test scripts per system identified and ready by June 17=E2=80=9318, 2=
025*.
      - Active engagement with business owners and functional leads
      underway.
   - *IT Systems Scripts:*
      - As of the meeting, nine end-to-end ERP scenario scripts (widely
      reusable across nine companies) are in development and partially thro=
ugh
      unit testing.
      - Additional scripts will continue to be built out, with status
      reporting on progress.
   - *Challenges:*
      - Varied business participation: =E2=80=9CCash up=E2=80=9D team highl=
y supportive;
      =E2=80=9CCredit Collection Disputes=E2=80=9D team not engaged, posing=
 a business
alignment
      risk.
      - Lack of ownership or replacement in certain areas (e.g., Workiva,
      with Peter Tompkins=E2=80=99 departure) creates UAT preparation gaps.
      - *Lease Accelerator:* Behind schedule; due to recently executed
      PO/SOW, will miss July 7=E2=80=9311 UAT, as one month is needed for b=
uild.
      - Blackline and Hyperion (EPM) seen as =E2=80=9Con track.=E2=80=9D

------------------------------
4. *Preparation & Readiness Risks*

   - *Readiness Assessment:*
      - Some areas judged =E2=80=9Cnot that great=E2=80=9D in preparation; =
honest feedback
      given about needing stronger business-IT alignment.
      - Importance of umbrellas roles (e.g., UAT coordinators like Pierce)
      to connect IT and business requirements and close gaps.
   - *Communication Gaps:*
      - Jeff and Sukai are notably concerned with low information flow and
      the lack of a clear, summary plan for UAT and defect reporting.
      - Strong recommendation articulated for clear summary slides and
      planning documentation to alleviate leadership concerns.
   - *Tracker Usage:*
      - Validation that Smartsheets-based dashboards will be produced as
      short-term solutions for leadership insight (=E2=80=9Cwhat started, w=
hat=E2=80=99s at
      risk,=E2=80=9D 30/60 day UAT lookaheads).
      - Plan to evolve beyond system-level tracking to include
      process-level metrics via integration with Capital Edge (PMO tool).

------------------------------
5. *Dashboarding & Reporting Structure*

   - *Dashboard Features:*
      - Visual tracking of SIT/UAT progress per system; identification of
      systems at risk or lagging.
      - Ability to =E2=80=9Cdouble click=E2=80=9D (drill down) to see which=
 work
      streams/functions are facing issues.
   - *Data Integration:*
      - Smartsheets serve as the base system-level dashboard (e.g., 82
      systems tracked, 21 in SIT as of now).
      - Process-level detail tracked by PMO via Capital Edge (mapping
      subprocesses to systems and test scenarios), supporting cross-validat=
ion.
   - *Data Maintenance:*
      - Request to Bill and Srinivas to help keep Smartsheets accurate and
      up to date (SIT/UAT dates, script status).
      - BI dashboard under construction to automate reporting in future
      phases.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Defect Tracking & Reporting*
   - Ensure Tosca setup for defect logging and access is complete,
      including provisioning business and IT users before SIT starts.

d,
      including risks and status per system.
      - Build or integrate BI dashboards for ongoing automated reporting
      (medium-term).
      - Share offline tracker/excel with Bill and Srinivas to populate
      missing or outdated information.
   5.

   *Leadership Communications*
   - Prepare and distribute a UAT summary slide/plan explaining approach,
      tool usage, automation, and supporting structure for leadership

and schedule follow-up discussions as needed.*
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Rakesh0:00
More importantly, for all the SIT execution that's happening, where do we
track? Is there a JIRA or another instance where you're tracking defects
and you know, reporting on that?
Srinivas0:17
So Bill, I think I'll comment on the SIT uat, what we have aligned and then
maybe you can comment. Okay. So Rakesh, the schedule is. Schedule looks
like this now.
Bill0:29
Right.
Srinivas0:30
The on site UAT is scheduled to start on 7th and 8th by 11. So basically
one week of UAT is what we are planning for now. Okay.
Rakesh0:40
Okay.
Srinivas0:41
Then technically the SIT will, I mean now team, I mean team is doing a unit
testing and etc. But the end to end SIT will start I believe from 23rd,
June 23rd, the week of June 3rd. And it could go all the way until the 4th
of July. Considering the close, we wanted to make sure that we take
advantage of the close to have the systems have the SIT completed.
Rakesh1:09
Okay then, so sorry, so if I. Sorry, let me, let me replay what I heard. So
UAT is 74 to 7 11.
Srinivas1:20
Nope.
Rakesh1:21
Across your. No, no, sorry, sorry. 777 to 7 11. July 7th to July 11th.
Okay. Sit would be 23rd to the 4th or the 2nd. Okay. Yeah, the Friday. Yep.
Or is it Wednesday? 2nd is Wednesday somewhere there. Right. So 23rd to the
2nd. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So. So 23rd is. Yeah, it's 23rd to the 2nd and then
you've got unit testing going on now till 23rd. Okay. Okay. So now from a
defect management perspective, what is the plan for you all to be able to
track defects? What tool do you typically use? What tool are you using or
what platform? I presume it's jira, but you know, are you able to run
reports? Why I'm asking this question is because Jeff is rolling the marble
as he says and he wants his weekly reporting. I suspect we will be coming
to you regularly and saying, you know, can you give us access to these
reports or can you extract reports for us? So I'm just trying to get ahead
of it to understand what toolsets we're using and how we're planning to
report on it.
Srinivas2:41
Bill, did the automation team comment on the tool that we should be using
for the uad?
Bill2:48
Tosca.
Rakesh2:50
Ah, okay. That's it till then Triton, just Tosca.
Srinivas2:56
So what we will then do, Rakesh, we will probably walk through the tool
maybe obviously the automation team with all IT functional group.
Rakesh3:06
Okay.
Srinivas3:07
Along with probably with business so that they get familiar. Then maybe we
need to provision the access for business and it.
Rakesh3:18
Right.
Srinivas3:19
Then when they participate in sid, let's say if it is doing it performs
this it they will obviously record whatever defects that they wanted to log
and then get those rectified before the uat. When UAT starts obviously the
users will have their own I mean access to report out the defects that as
they test through based on on the test scripts that we're going to share
with them.
Rakesh3:47
Okay. Okay. Now speaking of test scripts, do you have a few I know we sent
you the link etc. Business was going to track the scenarios for every so
business in their tracker was going to go through and say this is a sub
process, I'm touching this system. I have so many scenarios to touch
against this sub process that will touch the system. So from a, from a IT
systems perspective are you also tracking you know of test scripts per
system touch?
Bill4:19
Yep, yep.
Rakesh4:21
Is that something that you have ready or is that something that will be
developed?
Srinivas4:27
I would say let's target to have this ready by mid of next week build and
our team is working on putting together at least in finance work streams.
We are actively engaged with our functional with business to make sure we
have everything ready at least by early next week. That's in progress at
least as you remember. I mean as you recall Rakesh yesterday Caesar was
looking at at least any template but then it's great that we received
standard typical UAT scenarios but he's gonna probably work and help us
with his own test scenarios for HFM 99. Similarly I think for other
applications we're working on it. So that should be let's say Today is what
12th we should probably target for Tuesday 15th or 16th, 17th or 17th or
18th is what we to have this shared. Bill, I'll let you comment for erp.
Bill5:25
Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean right now we have extensively nine end to
end scripts that we're going to run very similar steps across all the nine
different rename and reuse companies that have some sort of ISE footprint
where we can you know do an order to cache scenario and the automation team
using Tricentis Tosca has been testing oh all week and last week, you know
these scripts making sure that they produce, you know what we expect them
to produce in terms of what the outputs should be with the new logos, the
new you know, changing Honeywell Solstice. Now not all of the forms have
been developed so we've got parallel tracks going and that's why you know,
I've been queasy, very queasy about you know, the notion that we would be
doing UAT earlier than we had originally planned, which was the UAT week of
seven. Because our last forms on the development track are going to be not
ready until 6:27. So that's gonna be right in the middle of our sit window.
I mean, maybe it's not a huge problem because it's for contract create, but
you know, it just makes you feel a lot better when you've got all the forms
and outputs sitting in quality along with all of your configuration in
quality. So when you run it, when you run a script, let's say on the 23rd,
that's going to be a contract create, it's still going to be a Honeywell,
not a Solstice contract.
Rakesh6:58
Okay. Okay.
Bill6:59
So sort of our plan for that. Audrey and I were just talking on the other
call half an hour ago that since we have, we're fortunate enough to have
teams in both IST and then at some level of time zone in the us we can do
this iteratively and follow the sign. So the IST team with Asha and the
automation team will run, you know, a series of scripts, let's say during
our nighttime on Monday the 23rd, then all any defects that they incur,
then the daylight hours team, our daylight hours team, can fix that. And if
there's no defects, then they can move on to the next set of scripts so
that perhaps we can accelerate the timeline to be done by the seventh, but
it gives us that 24 hour coverage.
Rakesh7:45
Got it.
Srinivas7:45
Okay.
Bill7:46
It's a non classic approach to uat. Normally we'd set it up in jira, load
the test scripts up in there, we'd execute them, defects get set out here,
we track all of those to completion. But the vision for this project is
shared by the Honeywell ITPMO is that they want to leverage automation for
this project, which really doesn't require user intervention other than for
validation of the script successfully did everything they were supposed to
do and created all the outputs that they were supposed to do. Right. And
they want to leverage that automation that we create for the physical
separation when they move outside of the LA down the road. Yep.
Rakesh8:26
Okay. Okay.
Bill8:27
Work. Work hard once and leverage it down the road. Make it eas.
Rakesh8:31
Right, right, right. No, that's super helpful to know. So maybe I
misunderstood. So going back to this Srinivas you had presented a couple of
dates earlier, so July 11, 7 to 11, I got that. I thought the virtual UAT
or the 2 to 3 hours virtual stuff, is that also UAT or is that a.
Bill8:50
No, it's not. It's more of A classic.
Srinivas8:52
It was, I think previous understanding was actually that two to three hours
supposed to be an uat, but then that's going to be a. Which means the
typical UAT will start from seventh to 11th. Okay, that's a correction. I
think I would have commented back to you, but then, yeah, that's the date.
Rakesh9:14
Okay. Okay. So that's good to know. We'll communicate that. Is there any.
And again, I'm asking this because what I'm hearing from Jeff and Sukai is
that they're uncomfortable with this whole UAT cutover partly because they
don't have much information flowing back to them. So I'm trying to make
sure that we can get some information on how we're doing this, etc. Is
there any summary slide or summary thing that says here's how you're
planning uat, here's how TOSCA is going to work, some sort of information
that can kind of put them at ease a bit?
Bill9:56
Yeah, we're working on that. You know, we're just now really, you know, we
were crawling and then, you know, now we're starting to walk.
Rakesh10:04
Okay. Okay. Because where I want to nip this in the bud, particularly when
it comes to Jeff, he's like a dog with a bone where if he grabs onto it,
he's like double, triple, quadruple clicking into it. And so he made a
comment earlier that, hey, I'm not comfortable on uat and so I want to make
sure I again nip that in the butt and we don't get unwanted spotlight. So,
you know, I mean, Paul's aware of this. You know, I talked to Paul a little
bit earlier, so we'll certainly talk about, you know, uat, Hypercare and
all that stuff in the all IT connect on Monday. But again, I want you, you
guys to be aware of this.
Srinivas10:41
Definitely. Agreed. Sorry for interruption. I have a safe sense of feeling
what Jeff kind of feeling.
Bill10:50
Right.
Srinivas10:50
The reason why I'm bringing up here is for example, in finance there are
some businesses who are so supportive, right. For example, Cash up.
Bill10:59
Right.
Srinivas10:59
The team is so supportive, they know what needs to be tested for Athens,
right. Based on number of bank accounts in scope, based on the reason
codes, whatnot, we are good there. But when it comes to credit collection
disputes, the existing team who are actually called business, so called
business, they're not in a position to comment like, okay, hey, you know
what, we have these scenarios what we want to test for Athens. They're
like, I don't really think Athens need XYZ forms or XYZ scenarios. But then
my problem was. My problem is if they don't help us in agreeing on the
scenarios that we want to test or execute for Athens, that's gonna. That'
going to be a failure for me tomorrow right after day one. That's number
one. So that's basically credit collection disputes. If you want to make a
note, we have a challenge there with the business alignment. We need their
commitment to us. Like okay, you know what it is okay. In helping us
executing these. These are defining these test scenarios for us. So that's
one. Then like yesterday Steve did highlighted that workiva. Right. We
don't know who's replacement of Peter Tompkins today. That's balance. So
there is a gap over there because the environment is ready sometime late
next week. SSO will be configured. What C1 team did is like they worked
with the consulting consultant and then they stand up the environment. Now
we need someone in the business to take the ownership kind of, you know,
they be comfortable with what functionality that they've developed and then
help us what scenarios they want to test. That's a gap. Right. Because.
Which means we have a dependency there as well. Then for Hyperion, I mean
EPM Hyperion. I think we are good there because Caesar knows everything
what we. What needs to be covered. We're good there. And then for lease
accelerator we'll. We'll have a risk because we just cut the PO and sow
this week. So we cannot meet these timelines. Yeah. 711 we can't definitely
meet because they need one month, almost one month schedule to complete the
build. Right. That's one key risk. Black line. Yes. I think black line we
can test. This is one. This is basically how do I say yes, you're Jeff is
right. You are right the way even I am kind of look the way I look at the
UAT preparation, the readiness. I think it's not that great going. I'm
being very.
Rakesh13:34
No, this is. Yeah, no, this is good feedback. I think I want to see how we
can rectify it. I know Pierce is not here because technically he's a UAT
coordinator for IT as well as the overall where he's supposed to help
connect the dots. Where you know how this is going to supposed to work is
yes. You know, you bring up all these issues, he identifies it. He talks to
the finance UAT lead, you know, Will Johnson and his team and says okay,
let's get this resolved, let's get this aligned, etc. I think, I think part
of the challenge is how do we build that connective tissue so that, you
know, in his role, he's able to get these requests from you or these
concerns and help connect the dots. I was hoping some of this alignment
calls that we were setting up are precisely intended to do that. Where we
align on scenarios, where we align on this. Now, one hour is not enough. We
probably need a few more conversations. We can kind of enforce it with
trackers and say, okay, if a tracker shows that it's not aligned, okay,
let's go chase it until it's closed. So there are ways to do it. I think
it's just. But again, it starts with. To the point you're making
identifying now. Let me get tactically speaking. Mac, can you pull up the
tracker in smartsheets so that we can walk through this Srinivas? And Bill,
what we're trying to do is based on the work plans in smartsheets, we
pulled up a different tracker that has all the si IT UAT dates for all the
systems, at least from a systems perspective. And some dates obviously are
off or they just get pulled from the work plan. They're generic dates. We
need to overwrite them so that we want to run a. A bit of a dashboard on
them that. That talk through this. So Mac, can I ask you to do two things.
One, pull the smartsheets.
Srinivas15:28
So, Rakesh, before we even get that, I. So Bill, don't we need SRI and SRI
into this call because we don't want be sidetracked with what he's planning
to execute. Right. For the upcoming UAT lsit. I know he has different
thought process altogether because whenever I get to speak with him, he's
like, yeah, we are planning the schedule will be released. Bill will
publish it or Andre will publish it. I see a lot of gap there that 100%
agree, which are not connected, which means it's kind of a big failure.
Bill16:06
Now I have a question before we get the stuff we've been updating for
Sriram, you know, I've coordinated across, had calls with the EDI team, had
calls with the sourcing team because while they are supporting the erp,
they don't report through my team. Okay. But he was asking me to get it
done. So, hey, I'm team guy. So I coordinated with those cats, you know,
and they got it done. Is there going to be some sort of dashboarding for
that that you can share with Jeff so they can see the state of readiness?
Because we're also capturing risks and their issues in those sheets.
Rakesh16:41
In those. In those Couple of sheets we filled out. Yes, we can certainly
what we're looking to do there is against those. So there's a bit of a 2, 2
phase part to this from a system inventory perspective from, purely from an
SIT UAT for the systems, you know, we've got the work plans here, we've
taken it against all of the apps and saying, okay, these are the apps in
scope. There are some SIT UAT dates that we need to override or make it
accurate. You know, part of the conversation is okay for it. You have, you
have these systems in play, you know, that need SIT completion. You
probably need KT completion from a systems perspective because if it is a
build back system or a move as a system is the pitcher and the catch are
the same, you know, potentially if they are, then KT is done. But if not,
if Solstice is hiring somebody new, there's potential, you know, KT that
needs to happen. And then you get into UAT for these, you know, using these
systems. The question is, okay, how does it support work? You know, if you
don't have the picture available? That's something we're tracking. The
other piece of this as a tracker here is we're saying, okay, number of the
point I made earlier, number of test scenarios or test scripts within these
systems is something we would want to start tracking so that we can report
out on it all of that. Having said that, from a systems perspective we want
to start showing dashboards and if you can quickly share the other
dashboard there, Mac on the. What we're trying to show Jeff for tomorrow is
a simple dashboard that runs off of this, either a pivot or something until
we formalize it, a simple dashboard that has, you know, what's the status
of sid, what's the status of uat. So if you look at, you know, page one,
it's essentially something like this for him that says as of today I've got
this many systems in scope. I mean it's fairly self explanatory of what
started, what's not, what's at risk and essentially a stacked graph of SIT
and uat. So he can then at least be happy that we understand we're tracking
these. We may not get them completed or there may be more things at risk
here, but at least you know, we're tracking this. And then his 30 day look
ahead on UAT we're saying is from a systems perspective at least we
understand, you know, when what systems are going into uat, which will of
course translate into the processes that are getting tested. And the
business capabilities that are getting tested. But the idea here would be
to give him a 30, 60 day look ahead of you know, what is, what is coming
ahead for uat. Now this is purely from a systems perspective perhaps. Let
me get your reactions or thoughts on this Srinivas or Anne. Bill so does
this resonate with you or do you have any suggested edits to this? Purely
from a system display for him to dashboard and say what's the story on sit?
What's the story in uat?
Bill19:58
It's reasonably easy to consume I think.
Rakesh20:00
Right.
Bill20:02
Which senior leadership likes.
Rakesh20:05
Yeah, we wanted to make it fairly simple for them. Now the, the flip side
of this is the process piece which is in Capital Edge and being tracked by
pmo because what Sriram and others are going and doing is saying I have
this process, I have this many sub process within it, I'm touching these
Systems. So the 40 or so systems he gave he's going to put some 40 rows in
there or however many he needs to say, you know this sub process is
touching these seven systems. So he'll put seven rows there and then he's
going to track. Our PMO is tracking the completion of those process tests.
So if the end to end process like the point you made, you've got nine
scenarios if you will that you're doing end to end. So I think you know
Sriram is going to go into Capital Edge and say you know I'm touching this
end to end scenario within order to cache and I've got these three or four
sub areas and I'm touching 17 systems. So he's going to have 17 rows there.
He'll go in later on and say I've exit for each of this I've got you know,
130 scenarios as an example or for in totality and then he will mark off
there saying I've got you know, 50 of these 130 done etc. Etc. So we can
run some reporting off of that. So it's, that's how it's planned right now.
Bill21:28
And how does this get fed.
Rakesh21:30
Say that again.
Bill21:31
How are you. Where's this data being captured from? Or is someone just
created this slide off?
Rakesh21:37
No, this data is what we want to try and do is the smartsheets data that
you see from the plans. We want to build a bi dashboard on top of it so
that it's an automated way of reporting.
Bill21:54
Nine scenarios and roughly two dozen individual automated scripts.
Rakesh22:03
Okay.
Bill22:04
Of which in unit testing right now we've completed it too. So We've got a
lot of work.
Rakesh22:11
So how would we track that? So see that's, I can send you.
Bill22:15
The status update, you know, every, every day if you'd like.
Rakesh22:19
That would be, that would work as a start. What I want to try and do is
automate it or at least, you know, make it less manual by leveraging the
smartsheet data we have. So sit UAT is fine. I think. I don't want to
necessarily get granular than that and say, okay, I've had 24 unit test
scripts and I've completed two. I think sit is probably at that level is
fine. But we want to make sure that the data we have in the smartsheets
based on our plans is accurate. So maybe the ask then Srinivas bill is
we'll send you that smartsheet or we'll send you an offline copy and work
with you to populate the data.
Srinivas23:00
Okay.
Rakesh23:01
And then you know, there'll be a few fields, sit, start end, UAT start end,
which we think we know is 7 to 11. But then, you know, if there's any, you
know, scripts against these systems within your scope and so we'll pull
those back into the smartsheets and overwrite the data we have so that at
least when we build this bi, we start reporting on things like it's more
automated.
Bill23:25
Is it something that we, when I say we, I mean trainee boss and I, and he's
running the finance side, I'm running the, the other ERP side which there
are, as he knows there are finance steps included in order to cash, you
know. Yeah, but, yeah, yeah, but he's got all those other things, those
that he has to worry about, the bolt ons and stuff.
Rakesh23:43
Right.
Bill23:44
How would we status it? We go back into the smartsheet and say, you know,
we were, we were supposed to complete, complete six today we got one done
or we're supposed to complete three and we got five done and then that will
update your dashboard. Is that what you're hoping to see?
Rakesh23:58
Well, if we can get to that level now from your automation from. So that's
the other piece is in Tosca. If there, if that is going to be maintained in
Tosca, then we can just pull reports out of it in Tosca. Because I'm
thinking this, this system inventory sheet is going to be limited to just
systems. And you know, like you see here, I've got 82 systems, 50, 60 of
them need to start sit and 21 are in progress. It's at that level that will
get reported and maybe we add some things on, you know. But, but the other
piece I'm thinking is, and again, I'm. We're open to suggestion here. If
there's a better way to, to kind of make it holistic.
Bill24:43
If I'm, you know, sukai and I'm saying, okay, well, you got dates and
you've got roll up, but how do I know which group this is? You know, which
one is isc, which one's hr, which one's erp? Do you have granularity at
that level? If she wants to see it, yeah.
Rakesh25:02
You will have to double click into this and it will take you, you know,
there'll be reports from smartsheets that it's like a pivot it that will
show up that the 21 is, you know, these work streams or these systems.
Bill25:12
Because I want to see, you know, which ones are lagging behind. So.
Rakesh25:14
Right, right, right, right.
Bill25:15
Provide a little grease for those skids.
Rakesh25:17
Yeah. So if I see the at risk is, you know, five of them. I want to double
click and see which function or work stream is having at risk. But I'm
thinking, I know we're a bit over time or at time, but yeah, I'm thinking
the question, the answer to your question is we do that on tosca where we
get the, you know, the scenarios run etc and run reporting out of it.
Because I don't think doing it out of smartsheets with work plans is robust
enough.
Bill25:45
Yeah, that's fine. I mean, they're not at a place yet. They being the task
automation team.
Rakesh25:50
Okay.
Bill25:53
To do that because they're still building and testing, you know, but
they're on track. I mean, we're still 11 days out from when they're
supposed to start. Right.
Rakesh26:03
Okay. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it's. Yeah. All right.
Bill26:08
Data quality issues, all sorts of things that have been getting in their
way and I've been trying to help. Smooth.
Rakesh26:16
Okay.
Bill26:17
But when I had some water go down my trachea instead of my esophagus.
Rakesh26:22
Sorry. Yeah, yeah.
Bill26:25
Probably the first time you had medical terms. On the call today to switch
it up a little.
Rakesh26:31
It's all the. It's all the. So I guess I'm hearing not to Saudi and UAE is
September 29th or thereabouts.
Bill26:42
Yeah. Ireland's gonna be August 25th.
Rakesh26:44
August 25th. Okay. Yeah, I just heard it this afternoon.
Bill26:49
Yeah, we just got finished adding those now milestones to, you know, our
schedule, our detailed plan.
Rakesh26:59
Okay. Okay. All right.
Bill27:01
All right.
Rakesh27:02
So, so I know, I don't they're.
Bill27:03
Gonna be many UATs that go with them too.
Rakesh27:05
That's the thing. That's the thing is we don't have a way of doing that
because I don't have a way of tracking it in the way it is now because,
yeah, you're going to be touching it several times and doing several
releases in that, but this is very linear in how it's being tracked.
Bill27:21
So sadly though, the Solstice team is not very linear in the way they've
been providing us curveballs and, you know, changes to scope.
Rakesh27:33
Yeah, yeah, we have to think through that. But. All right, so what we will
do is we'll send you an Excel Mac and I and try to, to get all the fields
that we need from you and Srinivas. And once we populate that, we'll make
sure we merge that or use the tracker you've already helping Sriram
populate so that we can start reporting on it. That as well.
Bill27:57
And Audrey's put together like a high level. Release 1, release 2, release
3, slide. Okay, as opposed to looking at our detailed schedule with all the
stuff that would bore you, right. Management into insanity that you
probably should have in your hip pocket when you meet tomorrow, just so
that you can explain why there's going to be some bumpiness in the UAT for
ERP with three go live between now and the end of September.
Rakesh28:22
Ah, yes. Okay, makes sense. All right. No, thank you both so much. So we'll
send out this. We'll follow up either do, you know, ping you individually
and do some, some working sessions to just clean up the list for us and
then we'll see, you know, again we have what we have for tomorrow and then
I'm sure he will want a fairly robust reporting structure on this one soon
enough. So we'll see how that goes. Thank you both. Thank you. Thanks all.
Srinivas28:50
Do you have a minute?
Bill28:51
Sure. Yeah.
Srinivas28:52
Thank you.
Bill28:53
Yeah, give me a call. It.

the automation team using Tricentis Tosca has been testing oh all week and =
last week, you know these scripts making sure that they produce, you know w=

 the forms have been developed so we&#39;ve got parallel tracks going and t=

he notion that we would be doing UAT earlier than we had originally planned=
, which was the UAT week of seven. Because our last forms on the developmen=
t track are going to be not ready until 6:27. So that&#39;s gonna be right =
in the middle of our sit window. I mean, maybe it&#39;s not a huge problem =
because it&#39;s for contract create, but you know, it just makes you feel =
a lot better when you&#39;ve got all the forms and outputs sitting in quali=
ty along with all of your configuration in quality. So when you run it, whe=
n you run a script, let&#39;s say on the 23rd, that&#39;s going to be a con=

 to be tested for Athens, right. Based on number of bank accounts in scope,=
 based on the reason codes, whatnot, we are good there. But when it comes t=
o credit collection disputes, the existing team who are actually called bus=
iness, so called business, they&#39;re not in a position to comment like, o=
kay, hey, you know what, we have these scenarios what we want to test for A=
thens. They&#39;re like, I don&#39;t really think Athens need XYZ forms or =
XYZ scenarios. But then my problem was. My problem is if they don&#39;t hel=
p us in agreeing on the scenarios that we want to test or execute for Athen=
s, that&#39;s gonna. That&#39; going to be a failure for me tomorrow right =
after day one. That&#39;s number one. So that&#39;s basically credit collec=
tion disputes. If you want to make a note, we have a challenge there with t=
he business alignment. We need their commitment to us. Like okay, you know =
what it is okay. In helping us executing these. These are defining these te=
st scenarios for us. So that&#39;s one. Then like yesterday Steve did highl=
ighted that workiva. Right. We don&#39;t know who&#39;s replacement of Pete=
r Tompkins today. That&#39;s balance. So there is a gap over there because =
the environment is ready sometime late next week. SSO will be configured. W=
hat C1 team did is like they worked with the consulting consultant and then=
 they stand up the environment. Now we need someone in the business to take=
 the ownership kind of, you know, they be comfortable with what functionali=
ty that they&#39;ve developed and then help us what scenarios they want to =
test. That&#39;s a gap. Right. Because. Which means we have a dependency th=
ere as well. Then for Hyperion, I mean EPM Hyperion. I think we are good th=
ere because Caesar knows everything what we. What needs to be covered. We&#=
39;re good there. And then for lease accelerator we&#39;ll. We&#39;ll have =
a risk because we just cut the PO and sow this week. So we cannot meet thes=
e timelines. Yeah. 711 we can&#39;t definitely meet because they need one m=
onth, almost one month schedule to complete the build. Right. That&#39;s on=
e key risk. Black line. Yes. I think black line we can test. This is one. T=
his is basically how do I say yes, you&#39;re Jeff is right. You are right =
the way even I am kind of look the way I look at the UAT preparation, the r=

ect the dots. Where you know how this is going to supposed to work is yes. =
You know, you bring up all these issues, he identifies it. He talks to the =
finance UAT lead, you know, Will Johnson and his team and says okay, let&#3=
9;s get this resolved, let&#39;s get this aligned, etc. I think, I think pa=
rt of the challenge is how do we build that connective tissue so that, you =
know, in his role, he&#39;s able to get these requests from you or these co=
ncerns and help connect the dots. I was hoping some of this alignment calls=
 that we were setting up are precisely intended to do that. Where we align =
on scenarios, where we align on this. Now, one hour is not enough. We proba=
bly need a few more conversations. We can kind of enforce it with trackers =
and say, okay, if a tracker shows that it&#39;s not aligned, okay, let&#39;=

&#39;s just. But again, it starts with. To the point you&#39;re making iden=

 we&#39;re trying to do is based on the work plans in smartsheets, we pulle=
d up a different tracker that has all the si IT UAT dates for all the syste=
ms, at least from a systems perspective. And some dates obviously are off o=
r they just get pulled from the work plan. They&#39;re generic dates. We ne=
ed to overwrite them so that we want to run a. A bit of a dashboard on them=
 that. That talk through this. So Mac, can I ask you to do two things. One,=
 pull the smartsheets.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:=

-size:16px;line-height:1.6">In those. In those Couple of sheets we filled o=
ut. Yes, we can certainly what we&#39;re looking to do there is against tho=
se. So there&#39;s a bit of a 2, 2 phase part to this from a system invento=
ry perspective from, purely from an SIT UAT for the systems, you know, we&#=
39;ve got the work plans here, we&#39;ve taken it against all of the apps a=
nd saying, okay, these are the apps in scope. There are some SIT UAT dates =
that we need to override or make it accurate. You know, part of the convers=
ation is okay for it. You have, you have these systems in play, you know, t=
hat need SIT completion. You probably need KT completion from a systems per=
spective because if it is a build back system or a move as a system is the =
pitcher and the catch are the same, you know, potentially if they are, then=
 KT is done. But if not, if Solstice is hiring somebody new, there&#39;s po=
tential, you know, KT that needs to happen. And then you get into UAT for t=
hese, you know, using these systems. The question is, okay, how does it sup=
port work? You know, if you don&#39;t have the picture available? That&#39;=
s something we&#39;re tracking. The other piece of this as a tracker here i=
s we&#39;re saying, okay, number of the point I made earlier, number of tes=
t scenarios or test scripts within these systems is something we would want=
 to start tracking so that we can report out on it all of that. Having said=
 that, from a systems perspective we want to start showing dashboards and i=
f you can quickly share the other dashboard there, Mac on the. What we&#39;=
re trying to show Jeff for tomorrow is a simple dashboard that runs off of =
this, either a pivot or something until we formalize it, a simple dashboard=
 that has, you know, what&#39;s the status of sid, what&#39;s the status of=
 uat. So if you look at, you know, page one, it&#39;s essentially something=
 like this for him that says as of today I&#39;ve got this many systems in =
scope. I mean it&#39;s fairly self explanatory of what started, what&#39;s =
not, what&#39;s at risk and essentially a stacked graph of SIT and uat. So =
he can then at least be happy that we understand we&#39;re tracking these. =
We may not get them completed or there may be more things at risk here, but=
 at least you know, we&#39;re tracking this. And then his 30 day look ahead=
 on UAT we&#39;re saying is from a systems perspective at least we understa=
nd, you know, when what systems are going into uat, which will of course tr=
anslate into the processes that are getting tested. And the business capabi=
lities that are getting tested. But the idea here would be to give him a 30=
, 60 day look ahead of you know, what is, what is coming ahead for uat. Now=
 this is purely from a systems perspective perhaps. Let me get your reactio=
ns or thoughts on this Srinivas or Anne. Bill so does this resonate with yo=
u or do you have any suggested edits to this? Purely from a system display =
for him to dashboard and say what&#39;s the story on sit? What&#39;s the st=
ory in uat?</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgr=

the, the flip side of this is the process piece which is in Capital Edge an=
d being tracked by pmo because what Sriram and others are going and doing i=
s saying I have this process, I have this many sub process within it, I&#39=
;m touching these Systems. So the 40 or so systems he gave he&#39;s going t=
o put some 40 rows in there or however many he needs to say, you know this =
sub process is touching these seven systems. So he&#39;ll put seven rows th=
ere and then he&#39;s going to track. Our PMO is tracking the completion of=
 those process tests. So if the end to end process like the point you made,=
 you&#39;ve got nine scenarios if you will that you&#39;re doing end to end=

 he&#39;s going to have 17 rows there. He&#39;ll go in later on and say I&#=
39;ve exit for each of this I&#39;ve got you know, 130 scenarios as an exam=
ple or for in totality and then he will mark off there saying I&#39;ve got =
you know, 50 of these 130 done etc. Etc. So we can run some reporting off o=
f that. So it&#39;s, that&#39;s how it&#39;s planned right now.</div></div>=
