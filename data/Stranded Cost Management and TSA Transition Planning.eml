Summary of DiscussionMain Topics Discussed1. Updates and Challenges

   - The team aims to have an updated view by the end of this month but has
   made limited progress.
   - Need to develop a plan for identifying individuals, software,
   hardware, and services that have not yet moved.
   - Daily touchpoints are held with Arpit (coordinating GDS India team
   efforts); Corey is working on TSA (Transitional Service Agreement)
   definitions and costing.

2. Identification and Categorization Approach

   - Key job now is to:
      - Gather inventories for infrastructure, hardware, and software.
      - Clarify what is actually moving and what remains.
      - Validate inventories and identify gaps by engaging stakeholders.
      - Aggressively schedule meetings with owners to get clarity on status
      and collect data.
   - The roadmap developed in March guides current activities, but due
   dates have shifted to June (targeting June 15th/June 30th).

3. Stranded Costs and TSA Exits

   - Discussion around "stranded costs" for Honeywell:
      - Assets, systems, and labor that do not move post-Day 1 or after TSA
      periods end.
      - Labor: Internal labor not moved to Athens; external labor if
      contracts aren=E2=80=99t transferred; depreciation for assets not tra=
nsferred.
   - Transition relies on timing=E2=80=94exiting TSAs between August 31st a=
nd
   November 1st, with a window of 6-12 months affecting cost residuals.
   - Sequencing of exits from TSAs and timing influence how much cost is
   left with Honeywell post-Day 1.
   - Both Day 1 and ongoing (Day 2) periods are important from a stranded
   cost perspective.

4. Financials and Allocations

   - IT spend is approximately $500 million per year (for Athens and
   associated units).
   - Athens is allocated around $50=E2=80=9355 million in costs; $21 millio=
n is
   being recovered by Honeywell via TSAs.
   - After TSAs expire, Honeywell will have to manage the residual costs.

5. Data Gathering & Stakeholder Engagement

   - Detailed game plan required to:
      - Identify and validate the components (hardware, software, labor,
      external services).
      - Engage different functional owners to gather missing or incomplete
      data, focusing on the biggest pain points=E2=80=94especially around l=
abor
      allocations and vendor contracts.
   - Need to analyze proportionality of support (e.g., how many people
   support each system/app and the proportion that should be stranded).
   - Cross-functional discussions (procurement, HR, supply chain) necessary
   to clarify complex labor arrangements.

6. Action Items and Next Steps

   - Review current models (from earlier gates/versions) and identify
   remaining blanks.
   - Develop and align a plan for targeted stakeholder meetings, focusing
   efforts on missing data and pain points.
   - Come back with a refined game plan for daily activities and meeting
   cadence for the next three to four weeks, ensuring readiness for June
   deadlines.
   - Prepare and share an agenda for upcoming discussions, including
   clarification of what is needed from each stakeholder.
   - Understand and document the process for capturing labor costs,
   including proportional allocations where teams are shared across units.
   - Validate and refine the milestone of stranded cost identification.

------------------------------
Timeline & Key Dates

   - Re-baselining deadlines: activities now extend to June 15th or June
   30th.
   - TSA exit transitions: generally from October 31st to November 1st,
   with a rolling 6=E2=80=9312 month window for finalization.

Open Points/Further Follow-Ups

   - Confirm data gaps and areas with missing information in the current
   model.
   - Stakeholder mapping: identify owners for each data component.
   - Validate the latest model from Gate 3 for stranded cost and update
   where necessary.
   - Schedule follow-up with Arpit and other core leaders for India team
   alignment.
   - Prepare to present initial findings and discuss the plan in tomorrow=

Unknown Leader / Project Lead0:00
Updated view by end of this month. So it's a bit of a challenge that we've
not made much progress on this. So the idea would then be okay, identify.
So we need to come up with a game plan for how we identify people, how we
identify the software, how we identify hardware, any services that are not
moved. So stuff like services, software, he'll be able to help because he's
on the procurement side. He'll be able to give us views on what services
get transferred, what's not, what software gets transferred, what's not.
And so some of these numbers may already be in the model, but for
infrastructure and hardware we need to see okay utilization. You know,
maybe there's some cyber work there, maybe there's also. Yeah. So cybers in
there. So this will like do they have an inventory? They do. So the
questions, yes, we're getting the inventory, but we need to understand
what's really moving.
Unknown Team Member0:52
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead0:53
And you know, can you do a one on one. But the idea here is the steps are
still valid. I think, you know, we'll have to change the timeline here and
be aggressive day on day to to schedule these meetings with the owners to
understand a view of this, etc. So next steps, all of these are valid, it's
just that these due dates are now getting to June and you know, we'd need
to. So that's the piece I'd like you to engage is we have the daily touch
point with Arpit, but connect with him. He's helping out as an overall, so
he's coordinating a lot of the GDS India team efforts. So as the SM there,
he's got experience doing all this stuff. So Corey is working with him on
the TSA defined definition and the costing. So one time in standalone and
then you'll need to work with him closely on refining the stranded ones. We
have the integrated gaming, so that's the portion of just an intro to how
we're going about doing this. Any initial thoughts, questions before we go
into the other again? This seems to be a roadmap that was developed back in
March. Oh, are you able to see it? So this was. How do we get this for gate
four? I'd need you to do me something similar for gate five. Right. I mean
content is still the same. Right. How do you approach this? How do you
identify these? How do you know, you know, getting to gate four, all of
this just moves, right. These activities are still the same. They still
need to get done. And then just take a look at this mile stranded milestone
and we'll see where we need to pick up and refine. This was a procurement.
These are all appendix slides. So they have a view here as well. So for the
contracts you will get that view from Andrew. But they essentially go into
this component. Right. The, the hardware, software, etc.
Unknown Team Member3:08
So these look like the initial buckets.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead3:11
They are. This is how we identify the buckets. So there's a. So if you
think about it, there's a decision tree behind this as well for day one. So
August October 31st to November 1st, there's some hardware software that
the dis. Synergies that they'll have to keep back. Internal labor certainly
is the depreciation, not depreciation. The labor costs that are truly
stranded, they will stay back. Any external labor that are there that is
not moved over or the contracts given to Athens for them to start if
Honeywell still has that same contract, that potentially a standard cost
for them. Depreciation is what we spoke about that's carried in the system
today in assets. But if the assets don't necessarily proportionally move
and the depreciation doesn't get carried over, it's. It's going to be that
this is at the end of the TSA exit. So there's going to be a lot of things
they put on TSAs as the TSA exits. There will be some stranded costs that
are formed because they are either, you know, they're, they're going to
keep that system in place and they are going to, you know, if they don't
exit quick enough, then there'll be some standard cost left because they
still have to pay that price to Honeywell or if they're stuck in a vendor,
you know there's still some stranded cost there that will be left for
Honeywell. Right. So you're gonna put is the point.
Unknown Team Member4:51
Of view on this for Honeywell or stranded stranded is for Honeywell.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead4:55
Yeah. So. So I've got, let's say 100 systems in TSA. I'm exiting them over
the next six to nine months or 12 months. Correct. If I exit them quickly,
then I'm paying the full TSA cost. If I exit them in say six months,
Honeywell has to deal with that problem six months from now. If I exit them
nine months or 12 months, Honeywell's getting the full cost. But I have
nine or 12 months to deal with the full cost. 45. Right. So the timing and
sequencing of the exits from Athens will drive some of the what is being
left over to Honeywell post post day one.
Unknown Team Member5:34
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead5:35
Prior to Day one, all of these things for hardware stuff, but because I'm
putting a crapload on TSA when they exit tsa, Honeywell needs to have a
plan for. Let's assume I've got 100 people supporting the TSA Honeywell,
Athens exits it six months from now. Six months. I need to know what to do
with those hundred people.
Unknown Team Member5:54
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead5:54
And if they do it in 12 months, I've got 12 months to figure that out.
Unknown Team Member5:57
Yeah. Is it truly stranded though? If they're paying the like the full
price of the TSA for the duration.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead6:01
Of the TSA, but when they exit.
Unknown Team Member6:03
TSA then you have this 100 people. Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead6:05
Okay, so that's the piece. Right. So how you sequence, how you exit all
will have a bearing on what the Honeywell stranded would be in the post day
one period.
Unknown Team Member6:16
Yeah. Are we most concerned with day one right now or do we need a good
point of view on day two? Both.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead6:22
They're both there. I think it's equally. There are two different perhaps
trigger points. Yeah, the focus is on day one, but then there will be a
residual day two as well. And then this is of course a timeline. So same
timeline, same activities are there. We just need to bake this in better
now on when the models have been developed, how are we going to set up? So
I'd like you to think through this, come back, take a, you know, digest all
this today, come up with a game plan and then tomorrow I want us to talk
about your perspective on how are we going to reach out, how are we going
to work to, to, you know, it could be the same eight or 10 activities, but
how are you gonna, how are we gonna get to June 15th or June 30th?
Unknown Team Member7:14
Okay, so I just pinged our pet.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead7:17
So I'll have him Arpitson in. Not which Arpit, the India Arpit.
Unknown Team Member7:21
Yeah, Mishra, that's what you said. Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead7:24
Yes, yes, he may be available, he may not be.
Unknown Team Member7:26
Yeah, he just went off. So it's late there, so I'll probably walk me
through it in the morning.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead7:33
So the idea here was that we did this top down initial view and said okay,
we've got about this much for what is allocated to Athens. We know that the
TSAs we will get. So there's about, let's put it this way, there's about a
hundred million in. I would say there's about 500 million probably. 500
million thereabouts is just the it spend per year. The parent of Athens has
Athens plus a couple of other business units into the business group, that
group. They're spinning out Athens. So the allocation for that group was
about 100 million. Athens was equal there. So it was about 50 million, 55
million. Why not? That was allocated as a top down. So that's the day one
run cost for Athens. They're going to get back 21 million of this Honeywell
is because of TSAs. So what is truly Honeywell has to take care of as a
starting point on day one is the leftover now potential once this 21
million goes away that they don't get the full revenue for in six months or
nine months they'll have to deal with that as well.
Unknown Team Member9:04
Yeah, there's your post TSA Stranded.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead9:06
So this is the view we put together and said okay that makes sense. Here's
how the approach should be. Bottoms up. We're going to do these again
reiterates all of the other stuff on here's how the approach is day one
sort of a decision tree. Analyze decide what we want to do. So again a lot
of the same content and expressed in different ways but it gives you a good
view of what the approach is and how we want to deal with it. Right. So
this is perhaps a better. Okay, yeah, no, I don't. I don't think it's been
incorporated yet. So all right, so and then you've got the approach here
which is very similar but then how does the talks through the same things
again? Is that what happens? Right. So and then there's the estimates which
I don't think there's much of a. These are all seem to be the same slides.
There's no much of an estimate.
Unknown Team Member10:12
That one was new.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead10:13
This is a standalone. This is not Stranded. So there's nothing here really
that's new. I don't know why. So connect with first and then y we can So I
don't know where the model gate 4. We don't even have a model here. Okay.
Strand cost. Okay, so look at gate three. This is the model. So take a look
at the model And Mahim is going to help us. Yeah, I'll talk to him. I need
to make an agenda on like the things I'm gonna discuss in tomorrow. So
yeah. So I'm gonna put that as one of the items. So tells you the summary
of what we've received. So my ask of you get a download of what the model
is and how this model is built.
Unknown Team Member11:19
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead11:20
And then tomorrow on the connect call we'll talk through you know just your
view on what you know, how you want to approach this. Right. So right or
wrong, let's, let's lay out a plan for how we want to tackle it day in and
day out over the next three, four weeks. I want to make sure that, you
know, you, you understand the approach here. You understand what needs to
be done.
Unknown Team Member11:44
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead11:45
Question is, you know, how do we go. How do we go about doing it?
Unknown Team Member11:49
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead11:49
The next few weeks.
Unknown Team Member11:50
Well, I mean like from the looks of it, it sounds like we have to start
with getting and driving those meetings and the data gathering. Right. Like
that's like at a medium level view, like the day to day. Right. Like I
think that a lot of these are going to be valid. I'm not sure that's what I
have to get from our page. Like what do we have and where are the blanks in
your model?
Unknown Leader / Project Lead12:12
And yeah.
Unknown Team Member12:13
And whatever the, like the net gap is, we need to identify who those
stakeholders are and start to have. Yeah. Have conversations and we need to
be.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead12:23
Targeted on that in the sense. Okay, we're identifying all of this, but
some of these we need to valid one, go back and validate. But two, this.
What are the biggest pain points that we need to go hit? Not sure why this
doesn't move. Okay.
Unknown Team Member12:51
It's probably a lot of frozen columns.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead13:19
Probably are. Okay, nice. There's no here. But yeah. So there's some views
on, you know, what's a hardware software, labor. So the components are
there. How do we get. So we need to talk through about how do we get labor
information. How do we get, you know, so we know the components. We need to
then have a conversation about how do we want to get those numbers for
those components. Like if you're talking labor, how would we want to go
about getting that labor cost?
Unknown Team Member13:53
Since it's probably. It depends what their census looks like.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead13:57
Census for what?
Unknown Team Member13:59
Ad count?
Unknown Leader / Project Lead14:00
Census for Honeywell or census for Athens.
Unknown Team Member14:03
Census for Athens. Right. And then cross check that against Honeywell
Census.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead14:07
No. Yes and no. In the sense Honeywell's got, let's say Athens it has got
90 people moving over or Athens it Org is that you can get the sensors but
we may not have a view of who's supporting what proportion.
Unknown Team Member14:31
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead14:31
Right. So we'll have to understand is there dedicated support for this app?
Unknown Team Member14:36
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead14:36
If not, is it like the TCs, LTIs NTGs that support this and they've got a
thousand people doing this and so we need to understand the proportionality
and I don't hear that's the piece we need to work with each. We need to
come up with a game plan first and then work with the work streams to say.
Unknown Team Member14:53
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead14:53
Oh, okay. NTT goes across four work streams. Hr, supply chain.
Unknown Team Member14:58
Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead14:59
Is it the same team? How many people do you have working? What proportion
do they work in? Do you know? So it may be a conversation with procurement
team. It may be a conversation with others to say, okay, let's get the
contract for NTTO 10 million for a year for J and Honeywell. But that's
across.
Unknown Team Member15:17
That sounds like pain point number one. Yeah.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead15:19
Right. But then we need to talk to the owners about, well, how many people
do you have supporting and how many do they technically now is it vendor?
We may not have that full view. We may get a view of okay. We may have a
view of how come not just ready. Do you need help picking up maybe Because
I think I should be good.
Unknown Team Member15:43
We'll help you.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead15:45
We go pick it up.
Unknown Team Member15:46
Yeah, we'll go. I'll help you.
Unknown Leader / Project Lead15:48
All right. We'll come back.
Unknown Team Member15:49
Yeah, I think they're.

eople, how we identify the software, how we identify hardware, any services=
 that are not moved. So stuff like services, software, he&#39;ll be able to=
 help because he&#39;s on the procurement side. He&#39;ll be able to give u=
s views on what services get transferred, what&#39;s not, what software get=

in the model, but for infrastructure and hardware we need to see okay utili=

 the owners to understand a view of this, etc. So next steps, all of these =
are valid, it&#39;s just that these due dates are now getting to June and y=
ou know, we&#39;d need to. So that&#39;s the piece I&#39;d like you to enga=
ge is we have the daily touch point with Arpit, but connect with him. He&#3=
9;s helping out as an overall, so he&#39;s coordinating a lot of the GDS In=
dia team efforts. So as the SM there, he&#39;s got experience doing all thi=
s stuff. So Corey is working with him on the TSA defined definition and the=
 costing. So one time in standalone and then you&#39;ll need to work with h=
im closely on refining the stranded ones. We have the integrated gaming, so=
 that&#39;s the portion of just an intro to how we&#39;re going about doing=
 this. Any initial thoughts, questions before we go into the other again? T=
his seems to be a roadmap that was developed back in March. Oh, are you abl=
e to see it? So this was. How do we get this for gate four? I&#39;d need yo=
u to do me something similar for gate five. Right. I mean content is still =
the same. Right. How do you approach this? How do you identify these? How d=
o you know, you know, getting to gate four, all of this just moves, right. =
These activities are still the same. They still need to get done. And then =
just take a look at this mile stranded milestone and we&#39;ll see where we=
 need to pick up and refine. This was a procurement. These are all appendix=
 slides. So they have a view here as well. So for the contracts you will ge=
t that view from Andrew. But they essentially go into this component. Right=
. The, the hardware, software, etc.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:=

1st, there&#39;s some hardware software that the dis. Synergies that they&#=
39;ll have to keep back. Internal labor certainly is the depreciation, not =
depreciation. The labor costs that are truly stranded, they will stay back.=
 Any external labor that are there that is not moved over or the contracts =
given to Athens for them to start if Honeywell still has that same contract=
, that potentially a standard cost for them. Depreciation is what we spoke =
about that&#39;s carried in the system today in assets. But if the assets d=
on&#39;t necessarily proportionally move and the depreciation doesn&#39;t g=
et carried over, it&#39;s. It&#39;s going to be that this is at the end of =
the TSA exit. So there&#39;s going to be a lot of things they put on TSAs a=
s the TSA exits. There will be some stranded costs that are formed because =
they are either, you know, they&#39;re, they&#39;re going to keep that syst=

nough, then there&#39;ll be some standard cost left because they still have=
 to pay that price to Honeywell or if they&#39;re stuck in a vendor, you kn=

1.6">So the idea here was that we did this top down initial view and said o=
kay, we&#39;ve got about this much for what is allocated to Athens. We know=
 that the TSAs we will get. So there&#39;s about, let&#39;s put it this way=
, there&#39;s about a hundred million in. I would say there&#39;s about 500=
 million probably. 500 million thereabouts is just the it spend per year. T=
he parent of Athens has Athens plus a couple of other business units into t=
he business group, that group. They&#39;re spinning out Athens. So the allo=
cation for that group was about 100 million. Athens was equal there. So it =
was about 50 million, 55 million. Why not? That was allocated as a top down=
. So that&#39;s the day one run cost for Athens. They&#39;re going to get b=
