Transcript:
0:00
You are now connected. You can merge your calls when ready.

0:05
Can you hear me okay?

0:06
Yeah, I can hear you.

0:08
Yeah. I'm not ignoring you. Not coming to your meetings. I figured if you =
need me, you'd reach out.

0:14
Of course.

0:17
Just want to know you're =
in my heart. I just can't make your meeting sometimes. You got a lot of =
them.

0:24
Thank you.

0:28
Just reach out if you do. If there's an issue =
comes up and everything, please do. Don't hesitate.

0:36
Later today. Mark, something did come up this. This week on ADX user IDs.

0:43
Oh, yeah, we're not moving the actuation people in though the adx.

0:51
Yeah, we'll want to see if there's any upgrades to other apps during =
the DT period that would require ADX user IDs for access. We do have one =
for Tableau coming in end of June.

1:09
That.

1:09
That's going to have some impact.

1:11
So you will then Breton and Zach in=
 that meeting as well.

1:18
They're already looped in. We had a =
conversation yesterday.

1:26
Yeah.

1:29
Are we good to get started? Yes, =
please. All right, let me share my screen. Okay, perfect. So we're gonna =
pull up screen, pull up compliments. All right. And I don't see a lot of =
awkward people on, but I'm gonna guess that they have other things that are=
 going on there. So we can just fill them in and maybe they'll just. =
They'll jump in. Hopefully. Janice, so of your pms, like, I don't see =
Nicole on at least that we have someone else sub for getting settled. Okay.=
 Yeah, we. I can. We can have her. We can skip over and have her join a =
little bit too. Okay, perfect. That's okay. All right. So 52 days left, you=
 guys. So I know we had our team meeting on Tuesday when we have our. Our =
items that were up with the number of days. And you know, it's kind of like=
 one of those. You blink and the days, the weeks, the months are already =
flying by. So I understand everyone's working very hard and I know we have =
a lot of things that are going on. So everyone right now is juggling a lot =
of falls and I appreciate everyone's help to be able to get us over the go =
line. So please, definitely, like Marcus started off, if you meet us and =
we're not at your meeting, that definitely reach out to be able to help =
escalate any concerns or issues that you guys have. Like I said, I know you=
 guys are working hard to be able to complete items. And I know obviously =
DT gets a lot of the brunt of everything that we're doing. Please, you know=
, just if, if you need us, make sure that you're reaching out. If we can't =
be at your attendance, it's only because we have a number of different =
meetings that are on our plate as well. As part of UAT which kicked off =
this week and the remaining, you know, 10 weeks worth of work, we're going =
to be working very closely with the non dt, right. And so if we're =
escalating to myself, Jason, the workstream leads on the rsi. We want to =
make sure that our partners are also escalating on the non DT as well. So =
then therefore our partners are also being able to hear the message and =
when we're meeting with the smo, they're hearing it twofold, they're =
hearing it from the call inside actually the actuation side and then =
they're also hearing about issues from our side as well. Does that make =
sense? I know that there's going to be a lot of positives and a lot of big =
things and changes that are happening or over the next few weeks. So I =
wanna be able to use the time to be able to communicate those things that =
are happening within our program to each other as well. And prior to us =
being able to kick off this week's session, I do wanna talk about a new =
item that had just popped and I know everyone's been hearing about us being=
 able to do the point of view cutover that we've been talking about, right.=
 And that we've had three options that had been sitting on the. And that is=
 in regards to our SAP changes, right. So we have our day one date which =
has not changed, it's still 5:30 and that's what we're marching to. So when=
 you hear me mention like 52 days left, that's 52 days to 5:30, right. That=
 we will be doing the day one or the sale of the Saffron. The options that =
we had on the table were the items that were part of new SAP company code =
changes that we were working for the 67 weekend which would have been the =
weekend after. So how we would implement those, do we do it before the go =
live, do we do it after the day one or do we do it the same time? Right. =
And we know that month end was happening. Right. Which is a financial =
aspect of it. The key concern not only for calling and Heritage Youth has, =
but also for RTX just in general. And there was discussions this week and =
we had the approval from corporate and RTX to be able to go all at once. So=
 everyone is going together on 5:30. Right. So that means that our day one,=
 our SAP and non SAP cutovers and plant coast company codes we're all =
working to that 5:30 day to be able to go together as one. So that is a =
change and we are going to have to look at the schedules that we have. Mark=
, I know that you're working with your team to be able to look to the 6768 =
time frame to be able to pull that in and making sure that we're all =
aligned and if there's any risks that we're working to mitigate those. Does=
 anybody have any questions in regards to that? Jen, you have a question? I=
 would add that we're going to reach out to the teams to start getting the =
heat maps aligned with that. Make sure we are the roadmaps and the work =
plan because I know some of them have that 6869 date. That's a good point. =
So that's a future activity. Yeah. So anything that has a 6768 state I =
don't know Hans on but we'll have him pull the tap edge work plans to see =
if there's anything greater than 5:30 and if there is he'll be working with=
 the PMs and the workstream lease in order for those dates to be pulled =
back in the heat maps and the roadmaps that are in confluence as well as =
the PowerPoint will also be updated to be able to have those dates. Okay, =
so that is a good point.

7:19
I do have. I've had some questions around =
the day one date and if there's any risk because of the EU approval that =
was delayed. Is this something that's normal? Does it normally happen with =
a divestiture and is there anything to be concerned about?

7:39
Helen, I don't know. Like you said the word normal. I don't know what's =
normal.

7:44
Yeah, redwood's not normal.

7:47
A few years later and we're=
 still here but I think that those approvals and waivers and the what we're=
 seeing is part of the normalcy. So we did reach out to Martin and Global =
Trade and the legal folks and we're still marching to 5:30. So as far as we=
 know the date is 5:30 and we're continuing to march. Like if something =
happens and it's part of the government approvals then we'll have to wait =
and see. But 5:30 is the date.

8:20
Allen and I would add this normal =
being subjective but this is common. Right. The timeline that our Collins =
legal and RTX legal team have told us is 5:30, and that includes the time =
to get the necessary legal and regulatory approvals. So in general, I think=
 between now and day one, we're going to hear repeated lack of a better =
term voice from the press around what might or might not be the fastest =
path to close. But from our perspective, our guidance should always be =
directed by the folks that have their leader.

8:56
Yeah.

8:57
All right. Okay, thank you.

9:00
Thank you for bringing that up, Helen.

9:02
Yeah, great, great, great point.

9:02
I've seen the news come out, =
right, so people are wondering, we'll do a draft.

9:06
Yeah, great question, Helen.

9:10
Then, Helen, I think I did see another =
email from you too, in regards to the peripherals and, like, what people =
can take with them and what they can't take with them on keyboards and like=
 webcams, et cetera. So we'll set up some time to be able to reconvene and =
have that discussion.

9:29
All right, that'd be great, thank you. Because =
they are escalating, saying that they'll have downtime in Bangalore. So. =
Yeah, that would be good. I think the note that I've just sent you and you =
probably haven't had a chance to read it, is more of a risk. The fact that =
we got notification today that we can't make any more changes to the =
Wolverhampton environment for four to six weeks. They don't want us moving =
anything into Wolverhampton. They don't want us copying any data or they =
don't want us cleansing any of the Electras data. They're putting us on =
hold for four weeks because of the issues that they've had. And it's still =
not a stable environment. So I have just sent you a note on that. So I know=
 you haven't had time to digest it, but it does impact a few things and we =
just asked that. Okay, we understand, but as soon as it's lifted, we need =
to have the support to make sure that we can meet our targets for day one.

10:35
Hey, Helen, do they think Redwood did this?

10:38
No, no, no, not at all. They're just. They are really, really nervous, Mark=
. I've never seen Richard Mapstone so nervous, to be honest, because they =
basically haven't got a backup of 92 terabytes of data. They're trying to =
install an additional storage array. It's apparently sitting at East =
Midlands Airport today trying to get through customs. So they, they, =
they're frightened to touch it, basically because they'd lose.

11:14
We got to be very careful that we do not associate this problem with =
Redwood. Right. What I'm saying, for it, it's not our problem. We didn't =
cause it. We don't want finger from actuation. Right.

11:23
We don't. They're not blaming redwood, but they don't want.

11:28
What's the idea in anybody's head.

11:30
Yeah, they. They just.

get started? Yes, please. All right, let me share my screen. Okay, perfect.=
 So we&#x27;re gonna pull up screen, pull up compliments. All right. And I =
don&#x27;t see a lot of awkward people on, but I&#x27;m gonna guess that =
they have other things that are going on there. So we can just fill them in=
 and maybe they&#x27;ll just. They&#x27;ll jump in. Hopefully. Janice, so =
of your pms, like, I don&#x27;t see Nicole on at least that we have someone=
 else sub for getting settled. Okay. Yeah, we. I can. We can have her. We =
can skip over and have her join a little bit too. Okay, perfect. =
That&#x27;s okay. All right. So 52 days left, you guys. So I know we had =
our team meeting on Tuesday when we have our. Our items that were up with =
the number of days. And you know, it&#x27;s kind of like one of those. You =
blink and the days, the weeks, the months are already flying by. So I =
understand everyone&#x27;s working very hard and I know we have a lot of =
things that are going on. So everyone right now is juggling a lot of falls =
and I appreciate everyone&#x27;s help to be able to get us over the go line=
. So please, definitely, like Marcus started off, if you meet us and =
we&#x27;re not at your meeting, that definitely reach out to be able to =
help escalate any concerns or issues that you guys have. Like I said, I =
know you guys are working hard to be able to complete items. And I know =
obviously DT gets a lot of the brunt of everything that we&#x27;re doing. =
Please, you know, just if, if you need us, make sure that you&#x27;re =
reaching out. If we can&#x27;t be at your attendance, it&#x27;s only =
because we have a number of different meetings that are on our plate as =
well. As part of UAT which kicked off this week and the remaining, you know=
, 10 weeks worth of work, we&#x27;re going to be working very closely with =
the non dt, right. And so if we&#x27;re escalating to myself, Jason, the =
workstream leads on the rsi. We want to make sure that our partners are =
also escalating on the non DT as well. So then therefore our partners are =
also being able to hear the message and when we&#x27;re meeting with the =
smo, they&#x27;re hearing it twofold, they&#x27;re hearing it from the call=
 inside actually the actuation side and then they&#x27;re also hearing =
about issues from our side as well. Does that make sense? I know that =
there&#x27;s going to be a lot of positives and a lot of big things and =
changes that are happening or over the next few weeks. So I wanna be able =
to use the time to be able to communicate those things that are happening =
within our program to each other as well. And prior to us being able to =
kick off this week&#x27;s session, I do wanna talk about a new item that =
had just popped and I know everyone&#x27;s been hearing about us being able=
 to do the point of view cutover that we&#x27;ve been talking about, right.=
 And that we&#x27;ve had three options that had been sitting on the. And =
that is in regards to our SAP changes, right. So we have our day one date =
which has not changed, it&#x27;s still 5:30 and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re=
 marching to. So when you hear me mention like 52 days left, that&#x27;s 52=
 days to 5:30, right. That we will be doing the day one or the sale of the =
Saffron. The options that we had on the table were the items that were part=
 of new SAP company code changes that we were working for the 67 weekend =
which would have been the weekend after. So how we would implement those, =
do we do it before the go live, do we do it after the day one or do we do =
it the same time? Right. And we know that month end was happening. Right. =
Which is a financial aspect of it. The key concern not only for calling and=
 Heritage Youth has, but also for RTX just in general. And there was =
discussions this week and we had the approval from corporate and RTX to be =
able to go all at once. So everyone is going together on 5:30. Right. So =
that means that our day one, our SAP and non SAP cutovers and plant coast =
company codes we&#x27;re all working to that 5:30 day to be able to go =
together as one. So that is a change and we are going to have to look at =
the schedules that we have. Mark, I know that you&#x27;re working with your=
 team to be able to look to the 6768 time frame to be able to pull that in =
and making sure that we&#x27;re all aligned and if there&#x27;s any risks =
that we&#x27;re working to mitigate those. Does anybody have any questions =
in regards to that? Jen, you have a question? I would add that we&#x27;re =
going to reach out to the teams to start getting the heat maps aligned with=
 that. Make sure we are the roadmaps and the work plan because I know some =
of them have that 6869 date. That&#x27;s a good point. So that&#x27;s a =
future activity. Yeah. So anything that has a 6768 state I don&#x27;t know =
Hans on but we&#x27;ll have him pull the tap edge work plans to see if =
there&#x27;s anything greater than 5:30 and if there is he&#x27;ll be =
working with the PMs and the workstream lease in order for those dates to =
be pulled back in the heat maps and the roadmaps that are in confluence as =
well as the PowerPoint will also be updated to be able to have those dates.=
