=F0=9F=93=9DSummary
Main Topics Discussed1. Spreadsheet Validation and Centralization

   - Team discussed validation of a spreadsheet tracking
   systems/applications involved in ongoing IT/business processes.
   - The spreadsheet lists ~40 critical systems (out of 300 total) that
   must be operational on =E2=80=9CDay One=E2=80=9D post-transition/migrati=
on.
   - Validation responsibilities were shared:
      - Columns have been reviewed by Gokul and others.
      - Updates and comments (from Gokul, Harry) are being consolidated in
      the IT Teams channel.
      - Awaiting further updates from Stephen and the CCX team.
   - Plan to share the centralized link for the live spreadsheet, ensuring
   version control and enabling real-time collaboration.

2. Focus of Testing and Resource Allocation

   - Clarification made that only about 7 key systems (plus some additional
   ones) require comprehensive 'build back' testing with substantial
   business/user acceptance testing (UAT).
   - The remaining systems (classified under TSA, Move AS, etc.) will have
   lighter or no business UAT, as their processes aren=E2=80=99t changing
   significantly.
   - Testing scope:
      - Majority of business engagement/testing will focus on the ~40
      critical applications.
      - There are about 300 total applications, but most will not be
      directly impacted/changed and need not be tested by business.
      - Each IT workstream may still perform parallel technical
      verifications on non-priority systems.

3. Testing Readiness and Next Steps

   - Action plan:
      - Complete the final version of the key systems list.
      - Appoint a business UAT lead (especially for build back systems).
      - Ensure columns tracking responsibilities/status (such as columns G
      and H) are up to date ahead of UAT starting next week (from June
9, 2025).
   - Upcoming discussions will further detail test scope, especially for
   systems such as Jira and Honeywell applications.

4. System Access and User Readiness

   - Emphasis on ensuring all required users/super users have the necessary
   access for testing.
   - Coordination with SSO (Single Sign-On) and other access management
   teams is ongoing to avoid testing delays.

5. Special Cases & Third-Party Portals

   - Some ambiguous items (e.g., =E2=80=9Cthird-party portals=E2=80=9D) wer=
e acknowledged;
   left with open questions for further clarification.
   - If business doesn=E2=80=99t require explicit testing for these, they m=
ay be
   deprioritized unless access or availability is critical for Day One.
   - Particular note: Some applications (e.g., =E2=80=9Ctaller=E2=80=9D und=
er mouses/MOSAS)
   require full functionality testing despite their lower risk profile.

6. Live Without Applications & Business Alignment

   - =E2=80=9CLive Without=E2=80=9D systems were discussed, notably the SUS=
 (Supplier
   Self-Service) Portal:
      - Definition: =E2=80=9CLive Without=E2=80=9D =3D system will not be a=
vailable Day One,
      but requires clarity on interim business workarounds or
migration impacts.
      - Key concern: Avoiding overlooked IT/business tasks related to
      migration or future enablement (e.g., moving suppliers out of
SUS Portal).
      - Action: Daniel and team to clarify the business plan for such
      migrations, validate if any IT involvement is necessary, and ensure a=
ll
      stakeholders are aligned.

Action Items & Follow-Ups

   - *Spreadsheet Management:* Share the central link to the updated
   spreadsheet in the IT Teams channel and maintain version control.
   - *Testing Preparation:*
      - Refine the critical systems list and ensure all required details
      are filled.
      - Assign a business UAT lead for systems with significant
      changes/build back.
      - Prepare test plans and scope definitions, especially for noted
      systems (e.g., Jira, Honeywell, CAP 900).
   - *Access Management:* Confirm all users have the necessary permissions
   ahead of UAT starting next week.
   - *Business & IT Alignment on =E2=80=9CLive Without=E2=80=9D Apps:*
      - Conduct a review round with business owners to clarify the true
      meaning of =E2=80=9CLive Without=E2=80=9D status for each application=
.
      - Specifically, address migration plans for SUS Portal and other
      similar applications; Daniel to facilitate alignment.
      - Validate if any overlooked IT actions are required and document
      them.
   - *Documentation/Slides:* Update presentation slides for tomorrow=E2=80=
=99s
   meeting with the latest system/application list and testing plans.
   - *Meetings:*
      - Continue this discussion in the next =E2=80=9CConnect=E2=80=9D meet=
ing, focusing on
      UAT lead roles, scope, and any open issues.
      - Encourage ongoing communication to resolve ambiguities or access
      issues.

Relevant Dates

   - UAT preparation to be finalized before next week; UAT scheduled to
   begin the week following June 9, 2025.
   - Continuous weekly slide updates are provided, capturing progress from
   both IT and business perspectives.

------------------------------

The discussion centers on finalizing and coordinating critical application
testing and access ahead of a significant business or IT migration/cutover,
with a strong emphasis on practical business involvement, alignment on
system statuses (especially "Live Without"), and robust
documentation/version control.

Sriram0:00
You are now connected.
Rakesh0:01
You can merge your calls when ready.
Gokul0:06
Documented.
Pramod0:07
Yeah, we can help you. I mean did you share this spreadsheet with me and
Gokul? We can help you to get the columns validated.
Daniel0:16
So I have already validated.
Gokul0:18
Yes, Google has.
Pramod0:19
Oh Gokul. So okay, so APO is with erp.
Gokul0:23
Okay.
Pramod0:25
Okay.
Daniel0:27
Ariba is also with the brp. Sorry, erp.
Pramod0:31
Ariba is also with ERP apos and P is also with erp.
Gokul0:36
So we can ask Bill, Bill Ponsetty or Shrinking SRI and Srinivas for that.
What is bex? I could not find anything for Bix Analyzer.
Pramod0:45
It's with ima.
Gokul0:47
I am. Okay, so that's data and intelligence. Okay.
Daniel0:51
Some. Some of the things have been filled already in the sheet that. Yes.
Rakesh0:57
So yeah, that's why I was asking the version control on this one. I think
Rakesh, if we can help put this on a place where everybody can update the
same place rather than we have.
Gokul1:08
We have. Yeah. So we're doing that. It's in the IT teams channel. So the
comments that Gokul sent as well as thus far Gokul and Harry have provided
comments.
Rakesh1:20
Okay.
Gokul1:20
Those are getting updated in the teams channel, the one that's in the mass,
you know, centralized location. We'll send you the link of that. We're
waiting for Stephen and the CCX team to update certain things.
Rakesh1:32
Okay.
Gokul1:33
But for the most part, whatever else we have received, it'll be in one
central place for you. We'll send that to you shortly.
Rakesh1:40
Thank you so much. Hey and see when I'm seeing there's about 40 systems,
right. Like almost half of them TSA live without or move assets. Right. And
then a few others. I still don't know the disposition yet. So it looks like
only these systems that are built back, maybe about seven of them. Right.
These seven systems and maybe a couple of more that will come from here. Is
that where the testing is going to be primarily focused on and that
everything else the SIT or IT testing is in the scope for uat? Does the
business need to do any other testing on any of these TSH systems or the
move AS systems?
Gokul2:23
So I think a lot. So these are the systems that you're touching as part of
the end to end process. Correct.
Rakesh2:29
So this is a short list of the systems that ISC has fed back to me as the
most critical ones that we want to ensure for day one. Right. And there are
many other systems of course that are about 300 plus applications overall.
But these 40 are what the Teams reverted back to me as the main ones that
we want to ensure we have available or else business will suffer on day one=
.
Gokul2:59
Understood. So yeah, certainly. And I want to delineate this now. There are
a bit, a few, couple of overlaps perhaps with a list at the bottom that
Gokul had shared as well. I think that was an older copy Gokul, I think you
shared the latest one. But you know, so, so those are also there. Some
build back move as is TSA is there as well. This the way I read this Sriram
was this is where business process is changing or getting tested and these
are the systems that are getting touched. Now in addition to that the
layering in here is that some of these systems are also changing.
Rakesh3:41
So I understand, I know that is definitely going to be other systems that
are outside of this 40 that each of the work streams in it are testing and
having business connections and all that. Yeah, that's a different set,
right? Yes. What my business focal point sub process owners are most
interested in is these 40 understood. If we have these 40s tested then we
are good to go in working condition at least for day one. I cannot don't
have resources time to go test 300 systems across all of the IT work
streams with business.
Gokul4:21
And you shouldn't because I think many of them are not changing and it's
primarily only these ones that you're touching that we need to make sure.
So yeah, so we'll certainly discuss this. I think let's bring it up on
tomorrow's connect as well And I think most of the players here are there.
For example Jira, I know Gary's here so. So you know Gary, you tagged as,
you know, Honeywell, Jira, there's a couple of Jira's there so we need to
understand, you know, the timing of that and the scope of the testing here.
Sriram. So these are the conversations we'll end up having tomorrow as
well. But as an example, but against all of these because you'll have to
understand what your test scope is as well.
Daniel5:03
Correct?
Rakesh5:03
Yeah. That's why once this list is is complete my next steps is to ensure
there's a business UAT lead especially focused on the build backs. Right.
And then ensuring that column G and H are up to date. And I think that's
the approach that we're taking here before the UAT's begin next week.
Gokul5:23
Yep, understood.
Rakesh5:26
All right, cool. Thank you.
Gokul5:27
We'll continue to refine this list and get you as much as we can today.
Rakesh5:33
Thank you.
Daniel5:34
So is there Anything that I have to update on top of it, Rakesh, other than
the one that I have provided in the comment section.
Gokul5:43
I think that should be okay. Now there are some things there, Sriram, if
you go back to the list, like third party portals, there isn't a particular
app like that or, or you know, like the comment made. So we may have to
understand, you know, it's not one single thing. It's, you know, few.
Rakesh6:00
I think if there are vague items like that, I'm okay with leaving that,
leaving that with the question mark. We can, I think the intention there
might be for the teams to be able to access those third party portals on
day one. I mean if there are specific things that we want to test out, then
so be it. But I don't think that's, I'm worried so much about that.
Gokul6:25
No, no, that's the other piece of this is I think we need to get the access
portion squared away because if, you know, as we have the user, super users
etc that are, that are going to be involved in this, you need, we need to
understand, you know, I know you're already talking to the SSO team, etc.
But for some of these, in fact for all of these, we need to make sure that
the right people have right access to. Excuse me, to go to commence the
testing. Gokul, getting to your question, I think, I think the information
you've provided is, will suffice for now the comments you made on the
supply chain systems or at least they're not being in.
Sriram7:08
Right, right.
Gokul7:08
So we will, okay, so we will go, we will go chase that up and understand
which work stream that falls in. I think one or two were actually live
without. So we'll reconfirm that in time for tomorrow.
Daniel7:25
But you can always refer my slides that I sent. Right?
Pramod7:29
Yes.
Daniel7:29
So even I included that slide in this ISC meeting as well. On a weekly
basis I usually update that slide not only from IEC and also from the IT
angle. You can keep that as you know, as a snapshot from IT system on what
we are going to do the testing during.
Gokul7:48
Right, right. So for tomorrow's call I'll take the slide that you just
shared.
Daniel7:52
Yeah.
Gokul7:54
And that's the latest version. So we'll replace it with what, what you just
had.
Daniel7:58
Sure, sure that works. Yes.
Gokul8:02
Okay.
Daniel8:02
Because only for five to six applications we have, the more, we have to put
more stress and you know, it's, it's going to be a comprehensive testing
with the business including you know, the CAP 900 that we are Going to
incorporate the I value of functionality on that.
Gokul8:14
That's.
Daniel8:15
Those are all the comprehensive testing. But the other things like anything
in tsa, anything in mosses, only for taller we have to do more testing
because taller is that kind of application though it is mosses. You need to
do the full functionality testing. But for the other mouses, stuff like
that we don't need to do. You know we do. You don't need to get sweat for
all of that.
Rakesh8:34
Okay.
Daniel8:36
All right, good.
Gokul8:37
Great.
Sriram8:39
Hey Gokul, I just want to bring up one topic here. Like I know I saw the
list when Sriram was flashing out. Daniel, I think this probably more
towards you. Like, I mean I know we flagged Sue's portal as Live Without. I
think we really need to make sure what that means for business from an IT
standpoint of you. We don't have any action items, Daniel. I want to make
sure how we handle the supplier migration outside of sus and then if we
need any help there, I think we need to know immediately. I think it's easy
to ignore the little bit though. But in this instance I think there is
going to be some impact or work that we need to quickly determine.
Pramod9:27
Yeah.
Harry9:27
And specifically for SUS Portal, one of the things that we will need to
consider is when we can do those enablements in Pariva. I know that we
don't want to do any enablement during the soft spin just for anything
related to the change itself of the legal entities. But once that is
passed, we will need to define like if we can do enablement still into the
Honeywell network, but if we will need to wait for the new network and get
them deactivated.
Daniel9:59
Sorry. Hi mom. Sorry I had some problem with my network. I'm sorry I didn't
get your full question.
Sriram10:09
I'm just calling out like as now we only have one minute. I think Source
Portal is just one of the example. Like even though we have Live without,
there may be a lot of action items associated with that app. I just want to
make sure we get a full alignment between business and IT and make sure
we're all on the same page. Because Live without means I don't want to
assume like there is no work for us. Right.
Daniel10:37
We just need to validate what is going to be the option in future. But the
STS portal is not aligned with isc. I mean do you want anything to be done
from isi?
Sriram10:51
It is with isc.
Daniel10:55
Yeah, because it should be with isc. No, we didn't have. Yeah. Yes.
Promote. We didn't have this kind of application when I received the
inventory.
Pramod11:05
Correct. It's not there. Maybe. Maybe it is because we already decided that
we will not have it correct in the first stage.
Sriram11:14
That. That's what I'm bringing up. Pramod, I think what. I think, what I'm
thinking here is live without doesn't mean that we're not gonna have any
work, especially moving off of suppliers. Right. So maybe we don't have any
work. I just want, like, we need to get a full alignment from business and
then saying that, you know, what are the actions that they need from it?
They don't need anything. Yes. Let's check that box on.
Daniel11:43
Yeah.
Gokul11:43
Who.
Daniel11:43
Who has that action?
Sriram11:45
Who has Daniel? Like, we need to get together and make sure, like, you
know, help us understand, like, what you guys are planning for migrating
these vendors. I think if we see that plan, then maybe we can validate
whether is there any IT work involved with it or not.
Pramod12:03
Yep, we'll do.
Gokul12:04
Yeah.
Sriram12:06
Swinging the desert example like Pramod. We just need to do a one quick
round of check and live without. What does it mean for us not.
Daniel12:15
Only for svs and also for other applications wherever we have this.
Sriram12:18
Yes. Correct.
Harry12:20
Just.
Sriram12:20
Just go one round of check with all the business and make sure we don't
have any surprises coming up there.
Daniel12:29
Good. All right. So yeah, I think we couldn't review the respective
functional slides. Probably. I will send across that. If you have any
questions, you can. Thank you all.
Pramod12:45
Great. Thanks all.
Sriram12:47
Thanks everyone.
