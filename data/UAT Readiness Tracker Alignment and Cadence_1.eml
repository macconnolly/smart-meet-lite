Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 9, 2025Attendees

   - Multiple team members actively participating; references to Sriram,
   Gokul, Bill, Srinivas, Justin, Sakina, Matt T., and others were made
   throughout.

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *Tracker and Data Management for UAT Readiness*

   - *Consolidation of Trackers*: Discussions focused on combining
   information from various systems ("Systems two" has been deleted, change=
s
   merged).
   - *Color Coding & Highlighting*: Use of yellow highlights for blanks to
   clearly identify fields needing input; removal of question marks to
   standardize visuals.
   - *Tracker Scope and Format*
      - Identification of 296 applications, with subset focus on key groups
      (e.g., 82 critical ones, with further breakdown by BRV, BRV-adjacent,=
 and
      non-BRV apps).
      - Decision to prepopulate fields where possible and give clear
      instructions for which items need input from respective teams.
      - Need to match tracker categories and flag names with PMO
      conventions (e.g., =E2=80=9Csystem type=E2=80=9D to be labeled as BRV=
, BRV-adjacent,
      non-BRV, NA).
   - *Field Requirements*:
      - Service owner validation (both Honeywell and Athens).
      - Status fields (KT status: complete, in progress, not needed, NA).
      - SIT (System Integration Testing) and UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
      start/end dates.
      - Go-live and testing dates at the application level.
   - *Data Capture for Functional Alignment*: Emphasis on capturing
   granular responsibility and readiness for each application; alignment ca=
lls
   are intended as working sessions.

2. *PowerPoint Preparation for Upcoming Meetings*

   - *Organization of Slides and Content*:
      - Preference for a punchy, concise message; clear call to action to
      be placed first.
      - Integration of a timeline at the top, combining slides 2 and 3 for
      clarity.
      - Timeline to include major milestones:
         - UAT Alignment window: Now=E2=80=93June 16, 2025.
         - UAT start: June 16, 2025 (Monday).
         - UAT end: July 15, 2025.
         - BRV UAT Go/No-Go: June 25=E2=80=9326, 2025.
      - *Task Instructions*:
      - Explicit bullet points regarding the actions needed: update
      trackers, validate key fields, update work plans, report status to
      Honeywell leadership.
      - Callout for linking slides and providing specific instructions per
      process or app where possible.

3. *Scope and Criteria for Categorizing Applications*

   - *BRV vs. BRV-Adjacent Applications*:
      - Delineation between apps critical for BRV (e.g., ERP, HR, and key
      finance applications) and those considered BRV-adjacent (particularly=
 for
      supply chain).
      - Approximate breakdown for supply chain: 5=E2=80=937 core BRV apps, =
~30
      BRV-adjacent, remainder as other (build-backs, day-one non-BRV).
   - *Cross-Functional Dependencies*:
      - Finance and supply chain have overlapping systems; need to ensure
      both are covered appropriately.
      - Action to ensure finance=E2=80=99s list (seven or eight apps) is ad=
ded if
      not already accounted for in supply chain.

4. *Templates for Alignment and Data Capture*

   - *Standardization across Functions*:
      - Agreement to replicate the supply chain data capture template for
      finance and other functions for consistent conversations.
      - Template should facilitate live editing during alignment calls,
      capturing process name, owner, impacted system, test scenario, and
      cross-functional dependencies.
   - *Role of the Template*:
      - Clarified that the template tracks readiness, owner alignment, and
      scenario definitions, but that formal completion tracking and reporti=
ng
      will happen in PMO-owned systems.
      - Noted that the working session is meant for live clarifications,
      rather than just assigning homework.

5. *Alignment Calls and Meeting Cadence*

   - *Detailed Scheduling*:
      - Alignment calls with each function set for the week (e.g., Tuesday
      for Finance, Wednesday for another group, Thursday for HR).
      - Possibility of later-week follow-ups based on progress.
   - *Purpose of Alignment Calls*:
      - Live working sessions to finalize owners, validate scope, confirm
      system readiness, and clarify test scenarios for each application.

6. *UAT Stakeholder Meeting Cadence and Communication Flow*

   - *Weekly "Week in the Life" Calendar*:
      - Visual schedule of all IT and PMO meetings (as described in the
      image section) to align everyone on communication flow.
   - *Regular UAT Coordinator Calls*:
      - Proposal for UAT coordinator meetings on Mondays and Tuesdays (to
      prepare updates for Wednesday all-hands).
      - Additional meetings (e.g., Thursday) for issue resolution and
      escalation as needed.
      - The need for clear visibility of this cadence in the meeting slides=
.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1. *Finalize and Circulate Cleaned Trackers*
      - Clean up tracker structure and prepopulate fields wherever possible=
.
      - Upload tracker to Smartsheet for direct editing by IT service
      owners.

      - Ensure clear, actionable bullet points outlining next steps and
      responsibilities.
      - Add a slide detailing the UAT stakeholder cadence/calendar.
   3. *Replicate Data Capture Template for Finance*
      - Adapt the supply chain template for finance function (and possibly
      others), ensuring consistency.
      - Pre-fill with known data (e.g., process owners, system mapping) to
      reduce meeting friction.
   4. *Disseminate Explicit Instructions*
      - Summarize exactly what each owner or tester needs to do (e.g.,
      update tracker, validate SIT/UAT dates, confirm process coverage).
      - Link or attach instructions in communications.
   5. *Schedule and Communicate Alignment Calls*
      - Confirm and remind all function owners of their alignment call
      times.
      - Prepare live-editable templates for each call.
   6. *Engage with Justin (Smartsheet)*
      - Assign Justin to upload and configure trackers in Smartsheet.
      - Ensure correct dropdown options and access for all relevant parties=
.
   7. *Prepare and Add MOS (Management Operating System) Calendar Slide*
      - Use provided example to prepare a slide showing proposed UAT
      coordinator cadence and escalation routes.
   8. *Summarize and Send Out Post-Meeting Communication*
      - Draft a summary of meeting outcomes, tracker access, and key dates
      for broader team and stakeholders.

------------------------------
Follow-up

   - *Next Steps after Tomorrow=E2=80=99s Meeting*:
      - Touch base after the alignment calls to ensure
      completion/validation of trackers and templates.
      - Review feedback from initial functional alignment calls to adjust
      process if needed.
      - Another coordination call is tentatively suggested for later today
      or within a couple of hours.
   - *Potential Additional Alignment Calls*:
      - Be prepared to schedule more alignment sessions this week as
      readiness is validated and gaps are found.
   - *Tracker and Template Refinements*:
      - Continue to refine fields and structures as feedback is received
      during live working sessions.

Matt0:25
It.
Justin8:24
All right, I'm. I'm back.
Matt8:26
Okay, we should be good now.
Justin8:31
Okay. Just the yellows. Are they all new ones he's added?
Matt8:36
No, the yellows are all. Everything that.
Justin8:38
Those are the blacks. Okay.
Matt8:43
So I combined any of the changes from Systems two back into this one. The
yellows are the blanks. I took out the question marks so that they will
highlight yellow.
Justin8:54
Yes, understood. Okay, that works. Now there are the things. So we need to
understand anything with Supply Chain Bex analyzer row number 10. We may
get a question on it as well tomorrow. But let's see. I think we need to
forward it to. Let me forward it to Srinivas and Bill to have them answer
these as well.
Matt9:33
Great.
Justin9:34
So that one. Systems two, you could delete.
Matt9:37
Yeah, I deleted it.
Justin9:38
Okay.
Matt9:48
And then let me. All right, so ping Sriram real quick and see if he can
send me the latest copy of the Or Gokul. It's covered the slide.
Justin10:01
Send you a link to the slide.
Matt10:03
Yeah.
Justin10:11
Okay, we can close this one and you can take care of that on the back.
Let's look at the content.
Matt10:20
Definitely.
Justin10:22
So.
Matt10:26
Do you want to go PowerPoint?
Justin10:28
Yes, PowerPoint. And then based on what we need for the meeting. So let's
look at the PowerPoint and let's see if it addresses everything we need to.
Matt10:41
Yeah, let me pull that back out. Okay. Just gonna share this one. Let's
see. I had to restart and close everything, but I don't think that we need
for the send version, I would just start. I would go straight. I would go
straight to the call to action.
Justin11:38
What are you. I'm still seeing the Excel.
Matt11:40
Oh.
Justin12:04
So what we can do is add the timeline here on top of this and combine your
slide 2 and 3.
Matt12:10
So definitely we had that. Actually thought we had it from last week. The
timeline. I need to find which slide that was in, but we had the timeline.
Oh, here it is. And so we can update the milestones. Drop it into here and
go here.
Justin13:02
So what we'll need on top, and I want it to be quite punchy.
Matt13:07
And.
Justin13:10
In what we're telling them, but to the point. So what I'd like is on the
top here. If you're going to add the slide timeline from slide two, it's.
So I want to. I want to give timelines that are very. So it's not just
resource tracker, dashboard tracking. I think it's. It's. Let's look at
slide 2 and see what timelines we want to show here on top. So some of this
stuff Is not. So I certainly. I definitely want the regional LES workshop,
which is 25th. No, sorry, sorry, sorry. Remove that one. That's not needed
for us. It's the brv. UAT go no go is certainly a must.
Matt14:04
So that's here is 625.
Justin14:07
Okay, now we need UAT start 620 to 715. The. Well, UAT period. So I. I want
to show. You know, maybe it's not like this. I think a timeline like slide
two may work better. You just pull in numbers, you know.
Matt14:32
Like slide two.
Justin14:34
Yeah, that. That chart. That is a better view of what we're trying to. What
I'm trying to tell them. So soft spin.
Matt14:50
So BRV go. No go.
Justin14:53
So we need that.
Matt14:57
Back here. And this is 6 26.
Justin15:07
So I'll spin is 81 25. 6 25.
Matt15:18
And then the UAT period is.
Justin15:22
UAT is 620 to 715.
Matt15:29
I would go like.
Justin15:37
Maybe another swim, Another bar.
Matt15:41
Yeah, we could do something like this. If we went like this is. And then
you could connect them like.
Justin16:51
Well, I don't want to say window because you have multiple windows. Just
say U18. Yeah, yeah.
Matt17:17
Something like that. And then you go BRV go. No go. Just gonna make these
about there.
Justin17:43
So the first one is between now and 6:20 when it starts. So today. And I
think UAT is actually starting next week. So actually you should. Let's
call out UAD start as 6 16. Just UAT end is 71516 is Monday. So.
Matt18:43
Monday to Monday.
Justin18:47
No, it may end. Sure. But yeah, that's it. Just a period. So the key point
is the alignment calls this week. So we need to talk about UAT alignment.
UAT functional alignment between now and 6 16. Just replace that with
another bar. That's. It's only one week. So.
Matt19:50
For UAT functional alignment.
Justin19:52
Yeah.
Matt20:00
Just add a bar too.
Justin20:05
We're not going to have space on the other slide. So just. I've got 15
minutes.
Matt20:24
Okay.
Justin20:25
This other call. So it need not be pretty. It's really. I just want
effective message. If it's just too matchstick lines that talk about the
fact that this. Testing this. We've got the alignment calls here. But more
importantly. So you can take care of that. I want to make sure. Let's go
back to slide number one. I want to make sure what is the message we're
giving them that I want there to be if we can add links to each of these.
So let's go to this one. So you Going to replace the map on top, the
roadmap on top with whatever we have. This one is.
Matt21:09
Finalize owners and responsibilities across uat.
Justin21:12
So, okay, so finalize. Yeah, just. It's not just finalized service owners.
I think there are two things to it. There's a broader responsibility,
alignment on owners, testers, etc. So in this case, just say finalize
ownership owners R and R or comma, R and R. And then the part of that you
can just make it bullet points here is, let's call it identify service
owners for all apps in Scope. And then you, you know, after service owners,
you can put in parentheses, Honeywell, comma Athens. The next step is
again, some of the bullets at the bottom support. I want to say. So why are
we doing this? So it's not captured. It's not just impacted. Systems are
captured. So identify. I would also say instead of finalize owners, the
second bullet, I would say start reporting on ITKT and UAT readiness.
Matt23:34
Oh, just freaked out there for a second. There we go.
Justin23:46
Okay, yeah, I think that's fine. I think those are maybe just say start
reporting to leadership to hon Leadership. What else are we doing? In that
tracker.
Matt24:24
There'S three things. There's the systems and all of their basic
information, like who owns it, who's responsible, the testing dates. And
then.
Justin24:37
Okay, so let's, let's list that too. So let's say Finalize Owner. Isn't
that part of the granular schedule then? Yeah, that's the second piece.
Matt24:47
Okay, what about like the number and then we have like the testing.
Justin24:52
Those are all in the scenario. Those are all in the schedule.
Matt24:55
Yeah.
Justin24:56
So the owner is for KT because I want to know for the 296, who's the
pitcher, who's the catcher. So is it Update Master Tracker, we should call
it. So I don't want to confuse System Inventory Tracker and Master, because
that's also called Master Inventory. So which one is this? Are they
updating in Smartsheets, are they updating Capital Edge?
Matt25:28
I was going to link them to the Excel that we have and then load the data
wherever it ends up living. Testing schedules in Smartsheet.
Justin25:48
Testing schedule.
Matt25:52
Which they already have. They just need to make sure that they're updated.
Justin25:58
The testing schedules and the work plans.
Matt26:01
Yes.
Justin26:02
Where else are the testing schedules? But then those testing schedules are
not by app. So that's why we created this inventory. They've got to go
update it by app.
Matt26:10
They've got them by app. Trusting the lookup. Right, Justin. Justin has
them by app in the smartsheet. So he's taking their work plans, ingesting
them, has them mapped and is extracting the UAT start and end by app.
Justin26:30
But again that's just a lookup against the prj. It's not by every app. He's
just referencing the fact that.
Matt26:37
Got it, got it, got it.
Justin26:40
So we need to ask them to. So this is where that's a granular schedule but
this is finalize owners R and R. So identify service owners for all apps.
Start reporting. So second bullet on the left. We could say. Should say
actually that's fine. Leave it there. So start reporting to Honeywell
leadership on it KT and UAT readiness and execution. Okay and the why it
matters. I'm not sold on that. That doesn't.
Matt27:43
We could delete this box make more.
Justin27:45
Room for now make more room for. Make more room for. For the other stuff
because I really want it to be about why does. Why do they have to do this?
Matt27:57
Yeah it's for.
Justin28:02
Let's look at granular schedule. So we should say something very specific
to the effect of. So it's not. Not necessarily validate granular schedules.
I would. I would. Let's rephrase it but I would leave that for now. But let
confirm the. The first bullet should be trying to see confirm the specific
sight UAT start end age. Let's reword that to update work plans and
trackers with application level readiness data. And then in parentheses you
could say SIT and UAT.
Matt29:34
Your.
Justin29:34
What do you have in the second building? Right. Your sit UAT start end
dates. What else do we add in the go live kt. Yeah kt. Okay.
Matt29:48
Yeah and scenario and then the next one is the scenario. So the next bullet
needs to be like the.
Justin29:55
But not. It's not in the granular. The schedule though.
Matt30:00
No.
Justin30:00
Or do they have to.
Matt30:02
That's in the like I wasn't even asking them to update the pre work. I was
going to like we have that the process to system list. Right. That I pre
populated with all of the ones that we have from finance and the ask is to
bring that to the alignment calls.
Justin30:27
No, no, this is a separate thing of they need to go in and whatever we're
mapping and we haven't talked about it and this is my scare here is that we
can't rely on just the lookup from Justin. We need a separate inventory of
296 or 82 that has the sit UAT that we need to create in smartsheets.
Matt30:47
So I think I created it in Excel, but I can load it into smartsheets.
Justin30:54
Let's do that. I think we're getting smartsheet licenses, so we should be
able to. But.
Matt31:00
So this one. So this is what I was going to ask them to fill out. Ignore
these top four. Okay, these top forwards was the example, but this is our
296. Where did it go? Yes, but. Yes, right now this. It was 296. I need to
see where the one with all 296 is. But 296. This same format.
Justin31:35
So for the 296, we should tell them that they only need to update the 82.
And we need to give them very specifically what they need to update and
call out.
Matt31:45
Can we give them this? Like, this is what we want them to Update for the
82. This is the 82 with sit start, sit end for them to validate. This is
what we think it might be. But they need to all of these columns. Athens
owner only for the. So I called that out in the next slide, like the very
specific instructions for this.
Justin32:15
But the 82 is not necessarily 80. Okay, so that's a very different. 82 is
the. So I would not call it 82. I would actually have it as 10 and 52. So
what you saw today, for example, like, you saw that Sriram had 40 systems
that he said are touched. So we should mark all those 40 systems as needed
for PRV. So it's not just 22 systems, technically speaking. That's the list
of the PRV for supply chain. Now we need to understand the seven or eight
that Finance sent out. Those are the ones that we should add in as PRV as
well.
Matt32:57
So that's what we should track in system type then brb, non brb.
Justin33:01
So it won't be system type. It's a brb, you know, criticality. Or there's
another one that's called whether it's needed for BRB or non brb. So
whatever the PMO called it. But there's a. There's a category, a name for
that filter flag. We should use the same name, not reinvent something. But
the whole idea was if is this needed for critical. Is this critical for BRV
or not? And I think the point is some of these are in tsa. Some of them are
move as is. Some of them are do nothing. But yeah, they're. What is it?
It's called. Is this. Is it called system type in the inventory?
Matt33:42
Yeah.
Justin33:45
Why is it called system type? Where is this coming from?
Matt33:50
This is the Smartsheet inventory.
Justin33:56
Okay, BRV adjacent. Interesting. Can you filter for the types? Okay, maybe
we do say BRV adjacent. All of these are BRV adjacent like the supply
chain, the 30 or 40.
Matt34:13
Exactly. They're not except for the actual.
Justin34:19
Like ERP or something that's a PRV related. But the other ones are. So
those 40 that he has should be BRV adjacent.
Matt34:30
Except for a couple of them will.
Justin34:32
Be a few of them now and this is where I want to delineate in that the
stuff that Gokul is showing, those are the build back move as is that are
just happening in some time frame. Most of them are before brv. But if you
saw his go live in his Excel he has some go live dates and we just need to.
Because they may or may not. They're just UAT happening and functional UAT
will happen on those. But the ones that this guy Sriram is talking about,
those are all related to 8.1B adjacent except for the few that you
mentioned that will have to be prv. So things like erp, HR, finance apps,
those are all purely brv. So the seven or eight finance apps, the four or
five ERP apps and then a couple of HR apps. Actually let's say the 22, the
original 22 or thereabouts would be truly the BRV there would be out of the
40 apps. The remaining 17, 18 would be BRV adjacent. Actually let me take
it back. If we're just talking supply chain, then Maybe we have five or six
or seven BRV related apps. The other 30 plus would be BRV adjacent.
Matt36:03
Yep.
Justin36:06
And then we've got to add the seven finance apps and let's hope, let's see
if the seven of them are included in the supply chain. If not, we'll add a
few more. You know, we'll need to bring those in. So my point is there will
be a subset of 22 or so that are purely BRV. There may be 30 or so that are
BRV adjacent and then the rest would be the other build backs and others
would be a day one for non brv.
Matt36:30
Exactly.
Justin36:32
That's what we need to get to by tomorrow. So if we're asking them to fill
out, then we need to fill that out for all 296 and say okay, this is a, you
know, day one TSA, but it's a BRV adjacent for 8:1 because supply chain's
touching it. So that's the list we need to send out. So let's go back back.
You can work on the cleaning up that list. But let's go back to the. Let's
go back to your PowerPoint because this is what we need to ask. Slide
number two is or slide number one. So update the update work plans and
tracker with app level testing readiness data. I need. We need to get more
granular or not granular. That's very specific. So update. We should say
update Excel tracker with testing. App testing dates. Now do they. And you
could say, you know, in parentheses sit uat or we should say tet with.
Let's say this. Excel tracker with testing dates, comma, sid UAD at app
level. Sit. No, no, no, you already have it situat saying at. At an app. At
app level. Okay. And then what else do they need to do? They need to update
though. They need to update their work plans.
Matt38:18
Do they need to update their work plans? Yes, if they haven't been.
Justin38:24
Okay, so let's say update, you know, update work plans to reflect latest
testing. Yeah. Test and testing and go live dates. What else do we need to
do for the granular schedule? So it's not up. So I'm looking at the bottom
there. Update smartsheet work plan. So it's not update. So I think we
should say what's the action here?
Matt39:07
I mean both of these are in the same Excel. Okay, so I bring one of these.
Justin39:14
Then just bring both of them. Just put a bar in across the two. Right, so
just say update Excel tracker.
Matt39:34
Yeah.
Justin39:43
But you get the point, right? We need to be very, very specific to say you
need. I need you to do thing on the left. I need you to do middle. But
where do I need you? What is it? So I want to say what is it for? And then
come back. So let's do this. I know. And then can you take a pass at this
and then add the. The other stuff on there and then keep your slide two.
Because I want to be very instructional to them to say here's an Excel. You
need to go do this. Update here, update here, update here.
Matt40:12
So this is for. I can make another copy of this for the. The that we have
for systems. This is the.
Justin40:26
This is alignment calls. Okay. So then we need to talk about alignment
calls.
Matt40:31
So the alignment call, there's like two of these really. It's like one with
the table for the alignment calls, which is the. This one. I pre filled
this with the finance data. I would Function process name, process owner,
systems touched, legal entity impacted impact description, cross functional
dependencies test scenario.
Justin40:54
If we need all of these. I don't think this is because this Guy Sriram is
already tracking that. If you look at IT systems, has he defined the tests?
What is the scope of testing required? What does this tell me? Like what is
the alignment call going to tell me here?
Matt41:15
Like how am I going to place.
Justin41:16
This in the alignment call?
Matt41:18
The scenarios, what like we got these scenarios from finance. I haven't
seen scenarios like this from at this level. Like these are the scenarios
that need to be tested. These are the systems involved.
Justin41:34
They're not, they're not scenarios, their process areas to be tested.
Matt41:40
Yeah.
Justin41:40
So under finance there are sub process, sub functions, if you will, and sub
areas. And this is the, these are, they have process owners for these and
these are processes that need to be tested.
Matt41:54
Yeah, this is like layer two. Remember that three layer table like at the
very top, the very top layer was the end to end process.
Justin42:05
This is those are these are these, these are not those are these are
related to those end to end.
Matt42:11
Yeah, these are all part of these are under the end to end. So end to end,
like procure to pay. Then within procure to pay there might be some subset
of these. And then below that are like the actual systems, it's this.
Justin42:26
So there's actually a slide that they sent. If you look at that slide on.
And I'm trying to see slide or email. No, my point I'm trying to make is
it's even within record to report or any of these they could have. So
that's how they've broken this across. So procure to pay, record to report.
Some of these just flow into this. So these are the process owners. So
they'll do the end to end testing and they're going to use these tests. So
similar to Sriram, Matt T here is going to use HCM and SAP to do whatever
testing. So on the finance call that's set up for Wednesday it is
essentially. So they sent me an email. Timmy, our EY team has developed
test scenarios. So we've got test scenarios that he sent. So the goal would
be for them to share the test scenarios. Say let's talk about finance call.
The goal would be walking through similarly understanding roles,
responsibilities, owners. We flash up a sheet that says these are the
finance owners by process areas who are the respective IT owners if there's
more needed, we fill that out with Harry right then and there. Next we go
into what are the test dates? So everything in our bullets, okay, we have
assigned the ownership. What are the systems in scope? They look at these
and we go, okay, is there more? Right, so similar to, so can we.
Matt44:11
Show them this table with another column for it owner. Fill that out.
Justin44:18
So similar to the. What this guy is doing for supply chain, we should
create a similar thing for, for finance. What we're doing with Sriram. We
should replicate that for finance like the, the same Excel workbook, this
guy.
Matt44:41
Yes, but we have this, this is the systems what we don't have supply chain.
Yeah.
Justin44:46
So I'm saying replicate this for finance.
Matt44:49
These systems, this is all going to.
Justin44:51
Be.
Matt44:53
Captured in the tracker that we're publishing. Right. Like all of this is
really a duplicate of the one that we were just reviewing. That's like brv,
BRV adjacent.
Justin45:10
Not necessarily. So that's a different purpose. But this is the data
capture template. This is a data capture for supply chain. Yes. We can
track it elsewhere. We will track certain things elsewhere because we're
not tracking BA business UAT lead and testing required, scope of testing
required, etc. We're just taking the list from here and putting it as BRV
adjacent somewhere else.
Matt45:35
Yeah.
Justin45:36
So my point is for a data capture template, we should. I suggest we do
something similar for finance. It can just be seven or 10 rows, 40 items.
Huh.
Matt45:50
So use this as the template.
Justin45:53
Use this as an example or create another one called, you know, BRV
readiness Template Systems Finance and put the same concept of these, you
know, processes. Well, these systems, you can call them as process, you've
got process owner. But the idea would be we need to look it up the same
dispositions and understand if you know a similar construct, we can put the
business UAT lead as these guys because they're process owners. And then
when it comes to test level of testing or test scenarios, we have test
scenarios that they have developed, we can then go back and. Because I want
us to have a consistent way of approaching the conversations with these
guys, not use several different templates.
Matt46:47
I agree. That's.
Justin46:49
I want one data collection template because this doesn't tell me much on
like, what does this tell me? Like impact description. Maybe it's just
misleading to me. The way you filled it out is. It doesn't. Well, let me
not. Okay, so talk to me about the logic here in the green and the yellows.
Matt47:16
Well, the yellows. The yellows are blank. They need to be filled out.
Justin47:20
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The bottom ones, I'm talking, I'm talking your. When you
say finance, Athens legal entity, cost center mapping, you know, it's
their. It's a description.
Matt47:28
But this one, what we get from this is the HR team. So we can align the HR
team With Finance and say HR folks for HCM data, will this be ready by
whatever the UAT testing date is for this process? Matt, have you talked to
hcm?
Justin47:50
That is a conversation we're having there. It's to bring them all together
to work through the sausage making. So providing more summary is not. So
the conversation for these alignment calls is precisely to work through
these things.
Matt48:06
And so Matt, this was going to drive that conversation, right?
Justin48:10
Like no, it's not. It's more than just saying, hey, have you met? It's like
we're meeting now, let's talk through it. So this is not for them to go
fill out and then set up other calls. It is truly a working session to say
these systems. I'm going to have the ERP guy here, I'm going to have the
data guy for Power bi. I'm going to have the finance guy for Workiva, I'm
going to have the HR guy for hc. So it's, it's understanding and talking to
them right there and saying these are the systems. What are the test
scenarios I need to run or the test use, you know, the use case for the,
not the use case, but the scope of testing. What environment would I fill
in, you know, where my test scenarios. Okay, Finance, you've given us the
test scenarios. Now how do we define the test cases? I do agree to your
point. Okay, do I need to have a follow up? Part of the action item? Could
be, yes, I need to follow up with these people. Okay, take an action item.
A talks to B after this call and reports out on the next call. But where
I'm not clear on is how they'll use this template to fill all that out. So
what would Finance fill? So this is sort of very much like. Okay, so it is
somewhat like we.
Matt49:33
Have all this information for finance. I think that for the other functions
we don't necessarily have the same degree of understanding.
Justin49:47
Is this more of a tracker? Because you, I mean you got the process system
mapping. I see this as more a tracker. If you say test scenarios filled,
summer scenarios defined, testers. Right. So then you're making this more
of a tracker. All these columns in green and red. Okay, green is okay, I've
identified HCM data. But what is it then? It's ready for testing? Yes. No
scenarios defined. Yes. No test scenarios needed. Yes. So then it just
becomes a tracker.
Matt50:28
Yeah. Which is what we'll have to get to. Right. For us to report on that
dashboard level that we aligned on, we need to know what are the processes
and how Many test scenarios have been defined. How many have been tested?
Justin50:51
But that again is being done by the BRV team, by the PMO team. The PMO
team. If you recall going back to Capital Edge, Anything above the 296 rows
is where the functional team is going to finance, is going to go in and say
for this process, Cost center alignment process, I'm going to create two
line items in the two rows, HCM and SAP, and I'm going to put some testing
information there. And so when they're finished testing this process of
Cost center alignment against SAP and against hcm, they'll come in and flag
it as complete in Capital Edge. Yes.
Matt51:41
Great. So then we don't have to worry about this.
Justin51:46
Not from our end.
Matt51:48
Perfect. So then this becomes less relevant.
Justin51:52
Okay. Yeah, I want to make sure that. What? Because I really want to get
into templates. What? And I forget the word template, but I want to
understand what files we're using to drive the conversation, what we will
live, edit, etc. This is purely. This is mostly live editing and not
exactly. So what are the other ones here then? System to the system. Go
back to your Excel.
Matt52:17
The system one we looked at.
Justin52:20
What is the system process? System mapping. Okay, so this. Okay, this one.
Service Owner validation, we are going to. Okay, can you move F and G out?
Actually flip them F and G. Yeah, so. And I would actually do it
Disposition first. So work stream it. Disposition. Honeywell Service Owner.
You know, it's it day one, Disposition. And we should call it the same name
as we have in the master inventory. So whatever it's called Final Aligned,
you know, something, whatever we named it. Okay, Honeywell Service Owner,
we should call Athens Service Owner. And they may or may not let them fill
it out. And then I think we should. So instead of system type, I do think
that should. I don't know the right word for this. System type just doesn't
resonate with me.
Matt54:05
Yeah, we can wordsmith the titles, but let's.
Justin54:08
Yeah, wordsmith is fine. But the point here is they say brv. BRV adjacent,
non brv.
Matt54:14
Yes.
Justin54:15
And do we have more options? Can they see D1? So if something is a TSA but
like ERP is a TSA but it's a PRV. So okay, maybe they say BRB non, BRV and
adjacent. And maybe NA. Because something like a TSA is an NA, except for
an SAP where you truly have a PRV.
Matt54:44
Yeah, we have TSA a BRV adjacent. No, no, no.
Justin54:50
So for example, SAP is a TSA on day one yeah, but it is critical to brv.
Matt54:59
So that's BRV adjacent.
Justin55:01
So no, it is BRV not adjacent, it's proper brv. So even though the
disposition is a tsa, the system type with BV brv. So that's where I want
to make sure that we have the options here are accurate.
Matt55:21
Our brv, BRV adjacent, na.
Justin55:26
So brv non brv, BRV adjacent and na.
Matt55:30
Exactly.
Justin55:31
Okay, so we should get four options there and then the rest of this is what
we're asking them to do is so we should pre populate this system type and
then have them validated. But then they should go in and that's been done
for set, start, set end, UAT start, UAT end. Maybe we also add in KT
complete date before sits dot and they can populate a date or na. So if
something is on a TSA and it's a. It's they may or may not have or if it's
a move as is, then there probably is no KT potentially. So they could go in
as NA or they could call it complete. So we do need to provide them drop
downs. Maybe it's a free text drop down. I don't know. So maybe it's a date
or maybe it's. If we say complete then we don't ask for the date. Maybe
it's just a text that says complete in progress needed. There's no date. So
we should say KT status and say complete in progress not needed. Maybe NA
is a fourth. There's a. There's a. So is NA the same as not needed?
Matt57:27
Yeah.
Justin57:29
Okay, and then they fill out the sit UAD dates I had pre populated those
from. Okay, so they need to validate them. Yeah. Okay. At every app. So. So
at least for the 82 then yes or. Yeah, 5250 plus 10 plus however many.
Okay, and then what else do we need in this tracker? So this tracker we
should clean it up so that it's. We have the drop downs for them to fill
out and we should. Ideally I'd like this in smartsheet so they can. This is
all the IT service owners, they all have smartsheets. So it would be good
to upload this in smartsheets and have them go directly populated there.
Matt58:19
I can have Justin do that real quick.
Justin58:22
Okay. As long as we've got the right columns and the right options. Yeah,
the drop downs for the 296 and then the BRB calendar, I would want an MOS
as well. So if you look at our MOS form folder. So I added comments in
here. So we've got Tuesday Finance Wednesday and then HR Thursday. So
Tuesday we've got that finance. We should have it Wednesday. Yeah, so this.
We should. If we can put this on a. On a table. I think you already have a
calendar table, but no need for it to be that fancy. Just put a. Put a
table. I mean what you have will work over there. We just need to show that
slide. But these are all the alignment calls. And then we may need
additional alignment calls maybe later in the week. Because if truly
testing is starting next week, then you know, they each align on things
week. The other one and you can fix this. The other one I'd like is an mos.
So if you take a look at what we have as mos, I'd like a view of the MOS
calendar. So this is essentially how the UAT execution calendar would be.
So maybe. Maybe it is. Take a look at. And let me share my screen for a
second here. These guys have a way of doing mos and me let me share my
screen. So it's under admin and mos. So if you look at the IT MOS that we
put together something like this. So the goal would be to show something
like this to say, okay, this is a standard. Here are the attendees and this
is what it's about. So it would be good to show a view that shows what this
meeting cadence. Not for the two weeks, but the regular. The one after.
Matt1:01:06
Yeah.
Justin1:01:08
The. The UAT coordinators to meet.
Matt1:01:11
Yeah.
Justin1:01:12
So maybe it's. Since it's. UAT is just over two, three weeks. Maybe they
meet two times a week. I don't know. But we can propose something like
this. Ideally I would, you know, I would have this, this stuff at the, at
the bottom here.
Matt1:01:38
Yeah, just a one page view.
Justin1:01:40
Right? A one page view. Right. So of the, of the pictures on top and you
know, this stuff at the bottom.
Matt1:01:50
Yeah.
Justin1:01:52
This is our current PMO of how we meet on Monday, how the rest of the world
meets on Tuesday. We all get together Wednesday for us, maybe we say
something around, you know, something like that, where we could say
proposed, you know, uat, you know, coordinator cadence. And we say, you
know, maybe there's a. What I'm thinking is there's a UAT call Monday, a
UAT coordinator call, and then perhaps there's a coordinator call Thursday
as well. But in between, say Tuesday or Wednesday, they. The different UAT
coordinators go meet their functions. So we could say internal, you know,
respective function alignments, etcetera.
Matt1:02:41
Yeah.
Justin1:02:42
Between Tuesday and Wednesday they come back Thursday and submit. Actually
it may be easier to do it on Wednesday. Sorry, on Tuesday. The reason I'm
thinking is the. This is an all hands call that is there on Wednesdays and
it may be that on those Wednesday calls Jeff wants the UAT coordinators to
provide a status update. So it'd be good for them to meet on Tuesday. Get
the latest provide on that.
Matt1:03:14
Yep.
Justin1:03:16
The latest info from their tracker, from their dashboards and present on
the call. And then maybe there's a Thursday meeting as well. So if you can.
This is the link to it.
Matt1:03:30
There's a like tissue resolution like. Yeah.
Justin1:03:33
Or something to that effect. Right. So I just want to see that flow. So
it's in here. Let me copy this link.
Matt1:03:40
This is a great start.
Justin1:03:43
So this is how they do MOS here or what they call mos. A week in the life.
There's other better ones, but that's a start to. To just put a calendar.
So first two weeks is all done. But the, the broader thing is, that's what
I'm thinking is we lay that out for them to also send and have them comment
because Pierce is going to own that and he's going to set that up. That
would be a functional alignment. One of the things we've called out for
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is alignment with, you know, UAT coordinators
or alignment on mos. It'd be good to share that on tomorrow's call, but
also for the. Perhaps it's secondary for the all it connect but it'd be
good to get that slide in as well for tomorrow to say here's how the
calendar looks like in terms of how we're going to meet and how we're going
to escalate, how we're going to resolve things.
Matt1:04:40
Yeah, I agree. Let me clean up these.
Justin1:04:44
You've got a few action items. Yeah, clean that up. One or two slides for
these guys is enough. Maybe one slide for the map the way we did the
roadmap and the. And the talking points and then one slide for the action
for them to fill the tracker. Yeah, and then.
Matt1:05:01
Exactly.
Justin1:05:02
We can tell Sakina to add it at the end whenever we send this stuff out
today.
Matt1:05:06
Sounds great. Yep. Cool, Cool.
Justin1:05:09
Thanks for get on this other call. Yeah, no worries. Let's touch base a
little later again. I just got to finish up this call and then. Which I'm
half an hour late to, but I'll finish that up and then we can catch up a
bit later, maybe in a couple of hours or something.
Matt1:05:24
An hour or two. Okay. Sounds great. Yeah, I'll bang this out. All right.
Thank you so much.
Justin1:05:28
Yep.
Matt1:05:28
Thanks. Bye.
Justin1:05:28
No worries. All good. Thank you.

it as 10 and 52. So what you saw today, for example, like, you saw that Sri=
ram had 40 systems that he said are touched. So we should mark all those 40=
 systems as needed for PRV. So it&#39;s not just 22 systems, technically sp=

couple of HR apps. Actually let&#39;s say the 22, the original 22 or therea=

mmy, our EY team has developed test scenarios. So we&#39;ve got test scenar=

. Say let&#39;s talk about finance call. The goal would be walking through =
similarly understanding roles, responsibilities, owners. We flash up a shee=

ctive IT owners if there&#39;s more needed, we fill that out with Harry rig=
ht then and there. Next we go into what are the test dates? So everything i=

done for set, start, set end, UAT start, UAT end. Maybe we also add in KT c=

thing is on a TSA and it&#39;s a. It&#39;s they may or may not have or if i=
t&#39;s a move as is, then there probably is no KT potentially. So they cou=

ybe it&#39;s a date or maybe it&#39;s. If we say complete then we don&#39;t=
 ask for the date. Maybe it&#39;s just a text that says complete in progres=

ah, the drop downs for the 296 and then the BRB calendar, I would want an M=

esday we&#39;ve got that finance. We should have it Wednesday. Yeah, so thi=
s. We should. If we can put this on a. On a table. I think you already have=
 a calendar table, but no need for it to be that fancy. Just put a. Put a t=
able. I mean what you have will work over there. We just need to show that =
slide. But these are all the alignment calls. And then we may need addition=
al alignment calls maybe later in the week. Because if truly testing is sta=
rting next week, then you know, they each align on things week. The other o=
ne and you can fix this. The other one I&#39;d like is an mos. So if you ta=
ke a look at what we have as mos, I&#39;d like a view of the MOS calendar. =
So this is essentially how the UAT execution calendar would be. So maybe. M=
aybe it is. Take a look at. And let me share my screen for a second here. T=
hese guys have a way of doing mos and me let me share my screen. So it&#39;=
s under admin and mos. So if you look at the IT MOS that we put together so=
mething like this. So the goal would be to show something like this to say,=
 okay, this is a standard. Here are the attendees and this is what it&#39;s=
 about. So it would be good to show a view that shows what this meeting cad=
ence. Not for the two weeks, but the regular. The one after.</div></div><di=

 this is how they do MOS here or what they call mos. A week in the life. Th=

9;s what I&#39;m thinking is we lay that out for them to also send and have=
 them comment because Pierce is going to own that and he&#39;s going to set=
 that up. That would be a functional alignment. One of the things we&#39;ve=
 called out for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is alignment with, you know, U=
AT coordinators or alignment on mos. It&#39;d be good to share that on tomo=
rrow&#39;s call, but also for the. Perhaps it&#39;s secondary for the all i=
t connect but it&#39;d be good to get that slide in as well for tomorrow to=
 say here&#39;s how the calendar looks like in terms of how we&#39;re going=
