UAT Governance and Tracking Tools Integration

# Meeting Summary

## Date
- Not specifically mentioned, but discussions reference an upcoming meeting=
 on **Friday**
- UAT and project milestones referenced for **August 1st =
(Soft Spin)** and **October 31st (Day One)**

---

## Attendees
- Jen
- Pre
- Jeff
- Rakesh
- Will
- Sean
- Pierce
- Others referenced: Harry, Ravi, =
Matt, Caesar, Justin, Rajesh, Max

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. **Capital Edge vs. Other Tracking Tools**
- **PMO=E2=80=99s =
Initiative:** The PMO is pushing for all process tracking and related =
activities to happen in **Capital Edge**.
- **Team Sentiment:** Strong =
aversion among team members to hands-on involvement with Capital Edge =
("would do anything humanly possible to avoid ever touching it").
- **Workaround:** The team has established a data replication process to =
minimize direct interaction with Capital Edge.
- **ISMO Team Role:** The =
ISMO team, passionate about Capital Edge, is responsible for its actual =
management. The current team will define requirements/data and have ISMO =
handle the implementation.

### 2. **Dashboards and Reporting**
- Dashboards can be built on top of **JIRA** or existing tools, with data =
aggregation aligned with Capital Edge.
- **Oak Project:** Utilizes =
spreadsheets for tracking, serving as a baseline for reporting.

### 3. **Defect Management Focus**
- **Recurring Client Concern:** There is=
 a significant preoccupation with **defect management and resolution**, =
many times raised by Jeff.
- **Team's Strategy:** The team aims to educate =
the client that defect resolution is just one part of the larger cutover =
and UAT journey (not a standalone focus).
- **Context:** The client is =
perceived as stuck on particular issues (defects) rather than considering =
broader governance and process integration.

### 4. **Workshop & =
Deliverable Structure**
- **Proposals for Agenda Design:**
  - Offer a **visual menu** or "thumbnails" on the agenda page to let =
stakeholders quickly identify areas of interest (e.g., roles & =
responsibilities, governance, process tracking, tools).
  - Two approaches for thumbnails:
    1. Generic artifact view =
(collateral/examples)
    2. Directly anchored to main agenda items (e.g., =
RACI for roles, calendar/list of meetings for governance)
  - Reduce number of items on agenda to maintain clarity, focusing on 5-6 =
primary components.
- **Executive Summary vs Overview:**
  - **Executive Summary/Problem Statement:** Sets Honeywell's challenge, e.=
g., the need for a well-defined process and governance for UAT with =
significant dates: **Soft Spin (August 1st)** and **Day One (October =
31st)**.
  - **Overview:** Describes what UAT is and where it fits in the =
transformation initiative.

### 5. **Governance Structure & Roles**
- Need to create/build on an existing slide outlining **cutover/UAT =
governance structure**.
- **Key Points:**=20
  - Who makes decisions, =
escalation process, PMO oversight, functional leads for escalations, =
separation between governance and hands-on testing.
  - Reference to a **3M governance structure example** that may be reused =
or adapted.

### 6. **Connecting Processes, Systems, and Functions**
- Importance of establishing connections ("many-to-many" mapping) between =
**business processes** and **IT systems** to correctly define scope of UAT =
and impacted scenarios.
- **Action Needed:** Regular cadence (MOS - =
Management Operating System) meetings between IT and business functions to =
align on these impacts and coordinate test script development and scenario =
planning.

### 7. **Test Script Ownership and UAT Outcomes**
- Determine ownership of test scripts (IT, business, or specific leads) and=
 ensure inventory and adequacy.
- Need to decide where test documentation =
(e.g., test cases/scripts) will reside (JIRA, shared drives, etc.) and how =
this is shared.
- **Proposed Facilitation:** UAT Coordinator (Pierce) and =
others to facilitate handshakes between functions and IT.

### 8. **Upcoming Deliverables and Workshop Preparation**
- Existing slides/materials to be reviewed and possibly enhanced, =
especially for:
  - UAT Overview & Approach
  - Roles & Responsibilities
  - Governance Structure
  - Key Activities & Phases of UAT
- **Friday's Deliverable:** Will cover a playbook/standard approach, =
customized for Honeywell=E2=80=99s context, but detailed/role-specific =
customization will require further conversation and time.

### 9. **Tool Access & Technical Issues**
- **Authenticator App Issues:** =
Some team members (including Justin) are unable to access Honeywell =
resources due to authentication issues.
  - Attempts to resolve include =
reinstalling apps and manual code entry, but problems persist.

### 10. **Power BI Connections and Data Reporting**
- Discussion around **Power BI** reporting and connecting with relevant =
parties (Ravi, Matt, Caesar) to move forward with finance portion reporting=
 and dashboards.

---

## Detailed Discussions

### A. **Client Maturity =
and Education**
- Client team considered "immature" regarding how =
interconnected the processes are; extra coaching is needed.
- Stakeholders (e.g., Jeff) tend to fixate on narrow issues (defects), but =
team is encouraging a "zoomed out" approach for long-term success.

### B. **UAT Timeline and Activities**
- **Soft Spin (August 1st)**
- **Day One (October 31st)**
- **Key Activities:**
  - Entry/exit criteria
  - Scenario/script alignment
  - MOS (regular check-ins) setup proposed =
for joint IT/functional collaboration

### C. **Next-Level Planning**
- Friday session will provide a high-level approach and agree on the =
structure.
- Deeper dives (customized names/roles, granular process detail)=
 to be scheduled later.

---

## Action Items

1. **Update Agenda Slide =
Thumbnails**
   - Assign: [Jen, Pre]
   - Make thumbnails tie directly to =
the agenda sections for clarity.
   - Reduce menu to 5-6 main topics.
2. **Prepare Draft of Executive Summary and Overview**
   - Define Honeywell=E2=80=99s UAT challenges, timeline, and goals (Aug 1,=
 Oct 31).
3. **Review and Enhance Slides**
   - Focus on =
roles/responsibilities, governance, UAT approach, and process integration.
   - Adapt or reuse the 3M governance structure slide.
4. **Build/Validate UAT Governance Structure**
   - Assign: [Rakesh, Sean, =
possibly Gus]
   - Consider the inclusion of PMO, decision rights, =
escalation flows.
5. **Establish MOS Cadence for UAT Readiness**
   - Assign: [Pierce with IT and business functions]
   - Setup regular meetings for scenario/script alignment between functions=
 and IT.
6. **Initiate Conversations on Power BI Reporting**
   - Assign: [Will, Ravi, Matt, Caesar]
   - Schedule earliest-possible =
call (by Friday) to clarify Power BI integration for UAT and finance =
reporting.
7. **Confirm/Test Script Ownership and Inventory**
   - Document who owns, who develops, and where scripts are stored and =
shared (IT, Finance, test leads).
8. **Investigate/Resolve Authenticator =
App Issues**
   - Assign: [Team members with issues, contact Justin for =
workaround]
   - Coordinate with IT support if persistent.

---

## Follow-Up Points

- **Friday=E2=80=99s Discussion:** Present "playbook" =
style approach for UAT; agreement on main structure.
- **Deeper Customization:** Additional sessions (est. 1 week+) needed to =
assign specific names/roles and build custom Honeywell workflows =
post-approval.
- **Team Connect:** Pending decision/clarification on its =
inclusion in UAT or as a "live without" system.
- **Power BI Session:** =
Confirm attendees and outcomes, ensure connection with finance/data =
analytics.
- **Governance MOS Sessions:** To be scheduled/facilitated by =
Pierce or Rakesh; cadence established for ongoing UAT alignment.
- **Authentication Issues:** Monitor and follow up if problems accessing =
Honeywell systems persist.

---

## Notable Dates

- **Soft Spin:** August =
1st
- **Day One:** October 31st
- **Friday:** Next major milestone for =
deliverables/presentation
- **Deeper workshop/planning session:** Possible =
in 1+ weeks (TBD based on Friday=E2=80=99s alignment)

---

## Other Notes

- Additional context around client team background (Pierce: PMP certified, =
facility/real estate background, not IT specialist).
- Ongoing need to align business processes, test scripts, and system =
functionality.
- Recognition that some clients are moving =
quickly=E2=80=94important to stay ahead with structure and process to =
prevent misalignment as execution escalates toward deployment dates.

Transcript:
0:00
PMO is looking to incorporate a lot of the tracking in =
Capital Edge because they want to do process tracking and all of that in =
Capital Edge. And Jen and Pre were saying we can build some additional =
dashboards on top of JIRA or whatever you have and aggregate reporting in =
association with Capital Edge.

0:18
In the base of a spreadsheet. Yeah. So=
 on Oak we use spreadsheets.

0:23
Is that a reaction or.

0:26
I hate Capital Edge. I know I would do anything humanly possible to avoid =
ever touching Capital Edge.

0:33
I think in this case the humanly possible=
 part is you'll have the SMO team do it. To be fair, we don't touch Capital=
 Edge often. We pretty early on in my time here set up something to where =
we were replicating our data into Capital Edge and we're largely hands off =
with Capital Edge. But that said, it's also improved a little bit and I =
know I say that every time, but it's a little bit better than it was before=
. It probably won't be a huge problem. The ISMO team is really passionate =
about using it. So I said we just tell them what we want in it and let them=
 manage the hands on stuff.

1:05
Yeah, it's more just getting the data in =
there. Like who is going to set up.

1:08
Maybe some one time effort.

1:10
Yeah, yeah, we've got a team for that. And like I said, this is not a team =
that we're managing. Yeah, it's Pre.

1:14
Yeah. PMO has a team, a Capital =
Edge team that supports. But we've been using it for nine months and I =
don't think that'll change.

1:20
No, yeah, yeah, it's fine. Jeff. Jeff is =
comfortable with it. So I don't know.

1:25
And I do want to touch on this =
because this was something that's a. They brought up humpteen times. =
Boatsukai.

1:31
The defect thing.

1:32
Yeah, the defect thing. So what I =
would suggest is at least get these two touch on. Touch on a little bit =
here and then touch on these, which is pretty much everything.

1:42
But hey, and just one thing. Let me throw an idea out there and please like=
 tell me it's stupid if you don't think it's going to land. But I'm just. =
This feels like a lot of like a fishing expedition around. Like we're =
throwing a lot of stuff on the wall to see what sticks because like =
basically my perception of this is Pierce has asked a really vague question=
 and we're like, here's nine things that we want to talk about to see if it=
 answers. You let me finish my proposal and you tell me if it's gonna. If =
it would help early in this process, maybe in the agenda page, I'd kind of =
like to anchor him onto some of the solutions that we're going to talk =
about. So what I'm thinking is maybe you shrink this down to half the page =
and on the right side you say roles and responsibilities, governance, =
process tracking and tools, something, and you do thumbnails of like a =
picture of what it would look like so that he can react to it and be like, =
that's the one that I want, or whatever. Do you see what I'm saying? Or do =
you think that you have a very clear.

2:39
No, no, no, no, no. I. I'm so.

2:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:42
It's not a fishing expedition. Yeah. This is =
the workplace, so it's not so much a fishing expedition. I want to level =
set for them because they're so hung up on defect management and resolution=
 and forgetting everything else. Their challenge is they keep bringing up =
that Honeywell does not have a good process of being a connective tissue of=
 it working with other functions. So all of them have this one track mind =
of how do I solve defects.

3:11
Yeah.

3:12
And I'm trying to tell my way.

3:14
I don't give a shit what they do and we don't have to talk to each =
other.

3:16
We don't talk to each other. I'm trying to tell them you =
really have to consider defect resolution as part of a broader thing. You =
really need to look at it like this. And it's not so much phishing, it's. =
Listen, if you're doing cutover and command center and HyperCare, UAT is =
just but one part of this whole journey between July and October.

3:38
Yeah, yeah.

3:39
And you're focused on the sliver, but I'm telling you, =
you need to set up this governance structure.

3:45
Great.

3:46
I think that's a wonderful point of view on. You've asked me a very narrow =
question. I'm going to answer it by telling you the whole story. Because =
you didn't know what to ask me. Right?

3:55
Because Sukhai said her point =
was, listen, if you've done this in other engagements, give us your point =
of view of how this works. So this is purely a point of view on.

4:06
We're telling you our methodology tailored to your situation. We know about=
 you.

4:11
Great.

4:11
So that's why I want to double click on. Listen, =
defect resolution. Here's how we have seen it work. We'll tailor it to you.=
 But again, this is forming a part of the broader thousand foot arch on.

4:23
Here's where defect resolution sits within the.

4:26
Broader grand scheme of phase. Hey, just one other comment about those =
thumbnails.

4:33
UAT Day 1 Readiness Use Case templates.

4:35
Yeah. So one other comment on those thumbnails. You could do one of two =
things I think would be really effective. What you have right now is more =
of an artifact view of. This is the collateral that goes into this that =
does not necessarily tie one for one for what's on the left.

4:50
Yeah.

4:50
Okay. But it's okay if you can explain it's all about the talk track. =
The other way you could do it is you could modify the thumbnails to anchor =
directly to what's on the left to say, okay, you're gonna need roles and =
responsibilities. Thumbnail of racy.

5:04
I don't care.

5:05
You're gonna need a. You're gonna need governance structure. It would be a =
thumbnail of a calendar or a list of meetings or something like that. =
You're gonna need a process thumbnail of a process map or whatever. I'm not=
 saying that what you have is wrong.

5:18
Yeah.

5:19
We just need to be able to tie them to be like, this is the underlying =
collateral that enables the stuff on the left.

5:25
So my action on me is update the thumbnail pictures to tie to what's on the=
 names.

5:30
Yeah, I think it's probably the easiest because what I want =
them to be able to do is look at it and be like, that's the one I want to =
talk about.

5:35
Yeah.

5:35
And then that way you're preventing you =
spending an hour talking. And they're like, I only cared about the last =
part.

5:40
Yeah.

5:40
I want to do it this way. We could do a sort of a =
bubble map or, you know, a centralized hub and spoke like we typically do, =
and put all the thumbnails around it and say, just like our BNI and our =
methodology deal tech methodology that we typically have.

5:56
Yeah.

5:57
We could put a slide like that and say, listen, these are the things you =
should consider. Which one do you want to talk about?

6:03
Yeah, I give them a menu.

6:06
You guys, you're the one who speak to this.=
 So you need to be passionate about it and have conviction. I like the =
agenda, and I like a little bit of extra on top of. You probably blow the =
thumbnails up a little bit and take up more space or something. Just enough=
 for them to look at it and be like, well, this is.

6:19
Yeah, I want to talk about that thing. Let's skip to there.

6:23
Or that way you at least get the opportunity to be like, great, I'm glad =
you narrowed in on that. You can't talk about that thing. Until we talk =
about these three things, I'm just trying to, like, get ahead of the talk.

6:32
Yeah.

6:32
We have an immature client, that's all. They don't know =
what they're asking for.

6:36
You know, And Jeff's like a dog with a bone =
that's caught a bone and won't let go. So his favorite bone now is defects.

6:45
Yeah.

6:46
Good. So he needs.

6:48
Is he the one who wanted to do =
like, AI copilot test scenarios? I looked up Pierce on LinkedIn. I looked =
at Pierce on LinkedIn and he has a. He has a PMP certification. And so if =
you have a PMP certification, you should be able to do this. Like, he's not=
 an it.

7:07
He's not an IT guy. He is used to building facilities.

7:11
Oh, okay.

7:11
So like real estate.

7:16
Okay.

7:18
But he's.

7:19
He knows processing and telling people what.

7:22
They'Re going to do. So =
we just tell them what to say.

7:24
We tell him what to tell people to do.

7:27
So we can format the agenda here.

7:28
But.

7:30
So perhaps maybe this changes. But yeah, at least an overview. But then =
each of these. And again, these are sort of deliverables. They're not. This=
 is like a workshop. Deliverable. Yeah, same thing here. Tracker. But this =
is again, we have to see where. If it's in the governance or in.

7:47
The tracking, I can take these out. Like, I really want to make sure that =
these tie to the specific element. Yeah, whatever. Yeah.

7:56
So we can maybe we do the other one. Like, the other one we have like, =
instead of a detail thing, we have the other format that's like this, right=
?

8:05
Yeah, something like this.

8:08
And. And then you can put a =
thumbnail right there. So maybe keep it to six or seven.

8:15
Yeah.

8:16
And then put six. And then we'll call out next steps at the bottom here.

8:19
Yeah, I would keep it to six or five even.

8:22
Yeah. So maybe just overview instead of summary. Well, we need a summary =
for Honeywell in context. That's okay.

8:32
How is that different from the=
 overview and UAT approach?

8:35
Overview approach is what is uat? Where =
does it fit in in the grand scheme of things?

8:38
Da da da da da o.

8:40
The executive summary is more. Here's your challenge, here's your problem. =
Here's how we're gonna. We're giving you a point of view. What's an =
executive summary?

8:48
What's the problem statement? What's the problem =
statement you need to do? Uat.

8:53
Well, UAT is coming for BRB and for =
soft spin and spin. And you need to understand. Have to have a well defined=
 process and a Governance structure for managing and planning and executing=
 this. So it's really laying it out as to what the problem Honeywell is =
facing by July and August is soft spin.

9:16
October 31st.

9:17
No, soft spin is August 1st.

9:19
Okay.

9:20
And then day one is October =
31st.

9:23
Okay.

9:25
So it's really more setting the context and saying,=
 here's what we're trying to solve. And then saying in an approach, this is=
 how you think of it in the scheme of things of uat. And then. So let's =
talk about content here. What do you have for in any of our slides? So you =
will remove this. At least do a pass on this one detail. Okay.

9:49
I want to get this. I wanted to get the topics done. So we have UAT put =
that as executive summary. Yeah.

9:56
Or challenge at hand or something. =
Right? Yeah. And then overview of approach, objective. Fine. I'll just say =
UAT overview and approach. Yeah. And that can talk about what the =
objectives of the UAT are. And then we can say typical roles and =
responsibilities. So we'll have a slide on that.

10:34
Can we use the existing slide or do you want to be more detailed?

10:38
Maybe we do a bit more detail. This is fine. We can take a look at passing =
this. I simplified this for them because these are in the Honeywell context=
, the roles. But if there's more we can add in here. So I think there are =
some standard slides. We can take a look at that and add it in here. But =
I'm looking for more around. Yeah, this is the case. But I also want a =
governance structure and the roles like who makes decisions. So in the =
context of governance structure, there's also roles like, there's an =
overarching layer of PMOing and governance that makes some decision rights.=
 Yeah, there are some, you know, it does some, you know, testing and =
execution. Functional leads may manage escalations.

11:28
I mean, that's why we need the governance structure separately.

11:30
So we do need that. Just a matter of tying it to this. So we do need a =
governance structure. We should look at a cutover or UAT governance =
structure. There's actually one from 3M that I have that we may be able to.

11:47
All right, what slides do we need to build? Is it the same one that =
Gus was sharing that call?

12:02
Yes. What is that?

12:14
Huh?

12:17
You wrote three strikes.

12:19
Yeah.

12:22
I'm logged out of my Honeywell=
 account.

12:24
Yeah. Wait, what?

12:26
Because it wants me to use, like =
it says, open your authenticator app.

12:29
Yeah.

12:30
And it never pings my authenticator app, so just.

12:33
Yeah, I have that problem sometimes as well. Just open up manually.

12:37
Dude. I've tried. And then I tried, like, the version that's like, enter a =
code from your app. I put the code in.

12:42
It doesn't work because =
normally it's like a number pops up, like 34 or whatever it is.

12:47
Yeah. And then there's, like, one where it's, like, in the app. It =
generates a code. Tried that way, too.

12:52
It just doesn't work.

12:52
It just doesn't work. And then I tried deleting the Authenticator app and =
removing it from my.

12:58
And then redoing it.

12:58
Yeah, redoing the whole thing. It doesn't work.

13:02
Maybe just.

13:03
But also, what's his name has the same problem. Justin.

13:06
Really?

13:06
Yeah. He has the same problem.

13:09
Maybe just ask him to see what =
he does. And if it just fixes itself, I'm assuming that's the case.

13:13
It's not. It's only gotten progressively worse. At first, I could get onto,=
 like, teams.

13:18
Yeah.

13:18
With it, I just couldn't follow any of =
the links. I couldn't access it in Edge. And then today, my team kicked me =
out.

13:25
Sorry, I've got to get on this call, but let's. Let's talk =
through.

13:28
Can you look for that 3m example?

13:30
Yeah, I'll give you the deck.

13:32
You mind kind of catching me up on =
this?

13:34
Yeah. So we're gonna go see that picture on the bottom left? =
Bottom right on the whiteboard.

13:42
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

13:44
That's what we're doing for the agenda. Another day with thumbnails. So. =
Yes. And so where we're going with this is I give some reason.

13:56
I gave everything away on the 15th.

13:59
This is.

14:00
Where does UAT sit within the branch of things it's going. UAT is like a =
function that needs to be performed for soft spin or day one. BRB is a good=
 time.

14:13
Like, say, that's just UAT. This is what UAT means.

14:16
Yeah, exactly. It's like. It's a. It's the Wilcoy 3 boxer, pretty much.

14:20
Okay.

14:23
Yeah. What. Okay, then. UAT overview and approach. =
That's straightforward.

14:37
Stop tips.

14:39
UAT overview and approach.=
 I don't know yet. Typical roles and responsibilities.

14:44
We do.

14:44
We have this slide plus an oak slide that we can use to build out with more=
 content if we want to. But I think that this will be a fine placeholder. =
But what we have to do is be able to tie this slide. So, like, above this =
slide, we want to be able to tie it to the governance structure. And we =
might honestly ultimately put this after the governance structure.

15:07
Is he retiring?

15:08
Because the governance structure is, like, at the =
top you have the coordinate. The you have what's this face? Pierce.

15:15
And then below that of these people are going to do.

15:18
Exactly. So I would honestly almost go this above that. So you have cutover=
 slash UAT governance structure. This is like we said an mos and, and then =
we'd go here. But the feedback from Sean and I agree with what Sean said. =
He said this is a lot of ground to cover.

15:39
Yeah.

15:39
In a day, a day and a half. And I think to be like, this is, this can be =
our point of view on like, here's what we've done before, here's like our =
typical approach and here's our thoughts based on the very big question =
that you've asked.

15:54
So what was the big question? How do you guys do =
this?

15:57
Well, they're super focused. Yeah. How do you guys do this? =
Can you give us examples of how you've run this before? Yeah, and =
specifically for defect planning. And it's like to understand where this =
sits and how this is executed, Rakesh wants to zoom out a little bit and =
say this is where UAT sits within the broader context of things in terms of=
 cutover and hypercare. Because UAT is just like one aspect in the broader,=
 like hypercare support model.

16:28
Crap load of white space there.

16:30
And so he's like, in order for you to understand this, first we have =
to talk about these three other things.

16:38
So throw in, throw in, throw=
 in some past people just for an example.

16:42
For Marrakesh, this I =
think is a fine first pass. We can build out more content if we have time. =
Next is the, this part that's zooming out. Here's where it sits within the =
broader context of things. We don't have that side that's we're going to =
need to build.

16:57
I actually kind of think that not only, yeah, this =
might be better because we say, hey, these are generally what we see. And =
then the governance structure is saying, now here's the names and boxes.

17:08
Yeah, but I don't. We're not giving them names and boxes.

17:11
I thought we have a Pierce's name.

17:13
Not today. No, not for Friday. =
Like, that's not like we are going to give them a pretty generic example. =
Like, I think that this level of, like, this is honestly, this is playbook =
stuff.

17:24
Basically.

17:25
This is, yeah, like, this is the, this is =
even highly customized. This is the typical slide that we use. Customized =
for Honeywell. And I would say that this might even be over the line in =
terms of what we want to deliver on Friday. Because for Friday we can =
answer the question With a lens based on the very broad question that we've=
 been asked. But Rakesh and I talked about, if you want to double click and=
 triple click into this, it needs another week and it needs a fine =
discussion and it needs ultimately what the front discussion is going to be=
 in order to give you a response that is like.

18:08
This is basically to get them centered into something and then get them to =
get more folks on their ass.

18:13
Is that just the Illinois Lottery or.

18:15
Is that the more broad we can keep it, the better? Yeah.

18:20
So.

18:22
And so this one we're gonna have to build. This is good. Oh no, this =
one's coming from the. This one is coming from the. Which I'm gonna call it=
 the PMO team has a slide on this.

18:40
So the thing is, do we really =
want to do this? Because then what I'm thinking this just be uat. All this =
makes sense.

18:47
Here's our governance structure. But this is the part =
about he wants to do UAT and zoom out. Like here's how UAT ties into the =
broader like support model and the command center.

19:01
I would feel like that.

19:03
No, I don't. And that team connect is not =
part of. So we can argue with him about that in a minute.

19:08
I push back. I don't want to build.

19:10
I believe it was a live without.=
 So I need to go back in. Because certainly if it's a live without, it's =
not going to be part of uat. If it is anything else other than, you know. =
Yeah, because other than that, then we need to understand why it's needed. =
We can certainly move it into uat. We just need to understand. Or you know,=
 for a one rather we just need to understand this.

19:35
What.

19:36
Process touches it, etc, and just, just move it in. If we need to, we can. =
My only concern is if it's a live without, it may be a challenge.

19:43
This is just uat. Then we can bring in this, maybe the appendix. Yeah, like=
 as next steps being like, hey listen, like a very general thing.

19:51
Saying like you gotta zoom out.

19:52
Yeah. This we can zoom out more and =
understand how UAT connects to Cutover and Hypercare. That can be a next =
step. I don't know, something that we need.

19:59
To bring in here. Yeah, =
I totally agree with you.

20:09
What I think about it's who's doing it, =
how are we doing it? And then who's doing it, how are we doing it?

20:22
Okay, we need. So part of this all came from the OP model discussions back =
in November, December and right through Gate three where a lot of these =
system OP models tied out to process OP models and it vetted these with the=
 functions to come up with the dispositions for these systems. So they =
didn't essentially, you know, they weren't done in isolation. Now, since =
then, the process that is needed uses this and you know, there isn't a =
manual workaround or if there isn't another manual process, but we need the=
 system in place, then we need to talk to Harry and Harry Tong and see what=
 we need to do about this. Because at this point everything is in a CR or =
change request. So we'll need to understand the scope, the use case of =
continued use for it. And we'll have to jump through all the hoops to get =
it added into the active list. Meaning is there is, you know, is there a =
one time cost associated with doing anything in it? Is there a run cost? =
Does it, is it material? All those questions need to be answered by the =
time it comes back in.

21:38
Hold on.

21:45
Yeah, so let me, I will send =
you via confirmation, via email. I'll go back and look at the inventory and=
 see if it's even there anymore. But yes, so all I, I think, I think I have=
 an email from you on this. So I'll respond to that email on.

22:00
Team Connect and it says that they're the same.

22:05
If it's a ping. Fine. Yeah, I'll. I noted down Team Connect. So I'll go =
back and send you via email.

22:12
Even then it's not. Still not. Or =
whatever the size is.

22:23
No, it's.

22:28
Different sizes.

22:28
There we go.

22:29
Oh, what the hell. Good catch. What I think is missing =
though is like between governance and uat, right? These are going to be =
from. This is how you're doing it and then this is the result. Right. I =
think there needs to be a.

22:45
One right before to be like no response =
yet. Because I don't, I don't think what was clear out of the workshop was =
who was connecting with, who was setting up those conversations with Ravi. =
Ideally it would be Ravi or Finance. You know, maybe we connect the dots =
with Pierce and say Ravi, have the conversation with you both and Will on =
what we do. Because I do recall two separate tracks on Power Bi, but =
certainly for the finance portion, we need to connect with Ravi and. Or the=
 others on that team. Rajesh. I think so again, the expectation was =
somebody on that UAT team would do it, but it looks like that hasn't =
happened. I can take it back to them and see. See, I mean, short of me =
setting up a call between us and Ravi and Will, I was giving them the =
chance to set it up. So.

23:46
Yeah.

23:50
Okay, I'll set it up for =
tomorrow. I don't need to be on it, but I'll certainly set up a call for =
tomorrow.

23:57
Yeah, I just needed something with a question mark like =
KPIs. How do you measure it?

24:04
Yeah.

24:09
You can make it happen.

24:10
Yeah. I mean it's basically just outcomes.

24:12
Yeah.

24:19
Martin Duran.

24:24
I wanted to leave this in there just as we talk Rakesh=
 through and say these are the key questions we're trying to answer like =
effectively.

24:32
Yeah.

24:32
And I'm send this to Sean real quick.

24:39
Sure. Whoever on your list.

24:40
Right.

24:40
You're given some list of others. So yeah, this is. Yeah, this is power =
bi's Matt and.

24:48
Caesar high level exponential. Then it's you know.

24:53
So you want me to set up the call with Ravi, Matt, Caesar, I'll do =
that for tomorrow or Friday, whatever. Is availability earliest so that =
they can sort out action on power beyond the.

25:06
Oak stuff and start seeing if there's. Do we see if we have like.

25:10
So I pulled in this one. This is like the testing skilled in phases. So =
this is like where it sits within the broader side of things. But there is =
this one which I think is better on. These are the typical goal activities.=
 These are the key activities for that. The what slide. The. The key =
activities for uat. That's this. I mean these are literally the key =
activities for UAT slide 7.

25:47
It.

26:29
That those two tell the same =
story.

26:30
Yeah, the exact same thing. I think actually.

26:40
Here'S where UAT sits.

26:41
It may or not be a simple answer and I think =
Will is a bit ahead of everyone else. I know he likes to be a couple of =
steps ahead. This is part of the broader conversation we're having with the=
 UAT coordinator peers on the engagement that needs to happen between the =
functions. Right. So this is part of that thing of it needs to connect with=
 each function. The respective work streams need to connect with functions =
to align on the scope of you know, system impact and process changes. Marry=
 up the many to many between systems and processes. Understand what gets =
touched so that we understand what. Align the solution.

27:17
Yeah you can call it whatever bullshit you want.

27:18
Select the processes that are changing and based on that sort of the test =
scenarios. So it really needs to be a conversation between the in your case=
 the finance sub functions and the finance IT leads, whether it's Harry and=
 his team or the data analytics and their team to have those conversations =
on. On this many to many and nail down what the scope of UAT would be =
subsequent to that they should be a conversation on you Know who has =
scripts? Some of the scripts are from it. There are some scripts that I =
think business has already or the test leads, the associated test leads for=
 the function will have. I think this conversation would then shed light on=
, okay, where are these scripts? Who has them? Is it in a system? Is it =
somebody's laptop? These scenarios, scripts corresponding to these =
scenarios, how many of them are already there? How many do we need to =
retrofit? How many do we need to create new. Yeah, it's all part of the =
broader conversation then of, okay, are we using. What sort of, you know, =
are we putting them in jira? Are we automating? Forget the automation piece=
 for now. But you know, if it's jira, you know, how is that going to be =
tested in jira? How will people get access to it? There's a lot of things =
that need to come. I think Will is jumping the gun here, but fair enough. =
It has to start with a conversation from the functions connecting with =
their. It leads to align on this. This. The many to many of. Listen, I've =
got, you know, these many subpro. These many processes across these sub =
functions. These are the ones that are truly changing and they touch these =
seven or eight systems. And then from a systems perspective, Harry and the =
team coming in and telling you, okay, we've only accounted for 4 or 5, but =
you're actually touching 7 to 8. So let's, let's understand their delta =
scope, etc. So that conversation needs to happen. It needs to be =
facilitated by peers, which means to be facilitated by me. But that hasn't =
happened yet and that's something we're putting in place. So you're =
probably a couple of steps ahead in terms of where we want to get to. It's =
just, you know, probably not happening fast enough. Script. No, not =
necessarily. It's a bit different. Right. You need to tell what needs to be=
 from a system perspective. It will tell you these are the changes, these =
are the of types, technical UAT changes happening. I think from a process =
perspective, it is understanding how the system is used and how the data =
and information flows through that system. So it truly is a connection =
between the two to have that conversation. It's script generation can =
certainly be it LED and putting it in JIRA and working through that can be =
it led with some support from finance, but certainly it led. But I think =
the initial conversation is truly a joint one. Now who should set it up? We=
 can, we can probably say, you know, peers needs to set that up as a, you =
know, as a. Again, it's not A one off. Right. There needs to be this. This =
cadence set up between the functions and IT to say, okay, let's meet on a =
regular basis. Let's talk through these. How are these scripts developing? =
How are these scenarios? Are these still in line? Here's how. So it needs =
to be a constant, for lack of a better word, mos set up between IT and each=
 of their respective functions. We're putting that in place. It hasn't =
happened yet, but, you know, those are the things that we're talking to =
peers about and trying to put that in place not just with finance, but =
across IT and every other function as part of this UAT readiness.

31:29
I think if we have a slide, I know we have something similar.

31:32
Yeah. Sometime third week of June, like entry criteria.

31:36
Left of the extra criteria. Right. And you can say these are some of the =
key activities. So coming in, we obviously have all this.

31:42
We're looking to work a schedule. I don't have an idea. They're ongoing in =
some of them this week.

31:50
Next year and then. Yeah.

31:53
Segue into the defect.

32:01
No, I would not. I would wait a copy Pierce =
on it, but I would certainly reach out to Harry, be proactive on that one. =
Harry and whoever else is needed, reach out and have that conversation. =
Loop Pierce into it. Copy me on it. But I think don't wait for, you know, =
Pierce to set it up or us. We. It'll take us a few days to set it up and =
get it. But I would say just be proactive and. And just go ahead and =
include us in the conversations.

32:38
When are you going to dinner?

32:41
I'm making my cousin up. I told her about the tbd, but I have to go =
to. No, but if that. Just do something here.

32:51
No, it's a conversation to set up an mos. Right. You could title it as MOS =
between IT and Finance. And one of the topics would be align on systems =
impacted and processes impacted and narrow down scenarios. Because the =
other challenge is, you know, Pierce is also new to this, so he's also =
going to go chase everything down and he will not have a clue of who has =
test script. So Harry may have some or his team in finance. It. Finance may=
 have some. There may be other test strips that are.

33:37
Do you want anything from upstairs?

33:38
The snack just upstairs come =
through. What are you working on?

33:46
Oh, I was using my interval.

33:47
Okay.

33:48
Did you see Sam's message?

33:49
What'd he say?

33:50
I was just asking a question to actually pick up the name.

33:57
What is that?

33:58
I went to like a rave with Joyce and I guess she.

34:04
Oh, My God. Oh my God, that's hilarious.

34:07
I can't even ask questions.

34:09
Hilarious.

34:11
Okay, great.

34:17
She asked a question.

34:18
I asked like a technician. He's tired of me =
asking for the nuances but we like, it's not that I want to, but I don't =
want.

34:24
To get in trouble later.

34:25
No, that's fine. You do a good=
 job. Doesn't matter what he responded.

34:28
Huh?

34:29
What did he respond to?

34:30
He, he asked me how Fisher was.

34:32
Like.

35:03
Their food just sucks so much. Like this might have been good.

35:11
Do you still have a lot of work left? When were you guys gonna have =
to leave the office? Today?

35:16
I feel bad for that. I think it's =
between me and Rakesh. We just haven't been able to sit in a room for 20 =
minutes.

35:24
Yeah, I mean.

35:27
No, I'm gonna do such. Yeah, I'm not =
gonna, I'm not gonna leave you alone. That'd be up. I'll make something =
today, tomorrow, whatever it is, won't take long. But I'm worried about him=
 getting cash.

35:47
Oh dude, I've been trying, I've been trying so hard =
all standing there twirling right now and then he put me on the spot for =
that.

35:55
That was weird.

35:55
I was like we have a, was talking about=
 five times today and you can't go on the spot for that. Especially when my=
 computer.

36:09
I was so electronic there.

36:11
Yeah. Wait, who are you guys making?

36:13
Do you have money?

36:21
Yeah, no, it's none of our money.

36:41
Yeah. Oh, you got two Celsius.

36:48
Oh, I did that instead of your drink.

36:51
Mine was like a =
different price.

36:59
Another.

37:23
Anish. Where are you and your =
cousin gonna go to dinner?

37:25
Kind of canceled on there.

test scenarios. So it really needs to be a conversation between the in your=

conversations on. On this many to many and nail down what the scope of UAT =
would be subsequent to that they should be a conversation on you Know who =
has scripts? Some of the scripts are from it. There are some scripts that I=
 think business has already or the test leads, the associated test leads =
for the function will have. I think this conversation would then shed light=
 on, okay, where are these scripts? Who has them? Is it in a system? Is it =
somebody&#x27;s laptop? These scenarios, scripts corresponding to these =
scenarios, how many of them are already there? How many do we need to =
retrofit? How many do we need to create new. Yeah, it&#x27;s all part of =

going to be tested in jira? How will people get access to it? There&#x27;s =
a lot of things that need to come. I think Will is jumping the gun here, =
but fair enough. It has to start with a conversation from the functions =
connecting with their. It leads to align on this. This. The many to many of=
. Listen, I&#x27;ve got, you know, these many subpro. These many processes =
across these sub functions. These are the ones that are truly changing and =
they touch these seven or eight systems. And then from a systems =
perspective, Harry and the team coming in and telling you, okay, we&#x27;ve=
 only accounted for 4 or 5, but you&#x27;re actually touching 7 to 8. So =
let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s understand their delta scope, etc. So that =
conversation needs to happen. It needs to be facilitated by peers, which =
means to be facilitated by me. But that hasn&#x27;t happened yet and =
that&#x27;s something we&#x27;re putting in place. So you&#x27;re probably =
a couple of steps ahead in terms of where we want to get to. It&#x27;s just=
, you know, probably not happening fast enough. Script. No, not necessarily=
. It&#x27;s a bit different. Right. You need to tell what needs to be from =
a system perspective. It will tell you these are the changes, these are the=
 of types, technical UAT changes happening. I think from a process =
perspective, it is understanding how the system is used and how the data =
and information flows through that system. So it truly is a connection =
between the two to have that conversation. It&#x27;s script generation can =
certainly be it LED and putting it in JIRA and working through that can be =
it led with some support from finance, but certainly it led. But I think =
the initial conversation is truly a joint one. Now who should set it up? We=
 can, we can probably say, you know, peers needs to set that up as a, you =
know, as a. Again, it&#x27;s not A one off. Right. There needs to be this. =
This cadence set up between the functions and IT to say, okay, let&#x27;s =
meet on a regular basis. Let&#x27;s talk through these. How are these =
scripts developing? How are these scenarios? Are these still in line? =
Here&#x27;s how. So it needs to be a constant, for lack of a better word, =
mos set up between IT and each of their respective functions. We&#x27;re =
putting that in place. It hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but, you know, those =
are the things that we&#x27;re talking to peers about and trying to put =
that in place not just with finance, but across IT and every other function=
