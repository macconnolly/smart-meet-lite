Meeting Summary

*Date:* June 16, 2025
*Participants:*

   - HR support team
   - Vicki (Support for Sakai, risk and opportunity management)
   - Rakesh (EYIT Program Lead =E2=80=93 Planning and Execution for Athens)
   - Mac (EYIT team, supporting UAT)
   - Bill (EY Engagement Partner, IT)
   - Sean (EY Support, IT Day-to-Day)
   - Sukai (Program Leadership)
   - Jessica (contributor, focusing on UAT organization and reporting)
   - Additional business and functional leads discussed

------------------------------
1. Introductions & Context

   - *HR Assignment:* One participant has supported the HR workstream for
   three months and is transitioning toward more direct program support as
   that work stream slows.
   - *Vicki=E2=80=99s Role:* Brought in to ensure risk/opportunity manageme=
nt and
   support Sakai and the group, fostering collaboration and completion.
   - *EYIT Leadership:*
      - Rakesh (day-to-day lead, working across all deliverables,
      supporting Paul, Sukai, and previously Krista).
      - Mac supports Rakesh, particularly on UAT.
      - Bill and Sean are EY partners; Bill especially for overall
      engagement.
   - *Observation:* The group convened as a response to escalations and
   confusion regarding status and coordination, especially for SIT (System
   Integration Test) and UAT (User Acceptance Test) phases.

------------------------------
2. Main Topics DiscussedA. Gaps Identified in Current Project Status

*Two Areas of Concern:*

   1.

   *Communication with UAT Participants:*
   - Insufficient communication with users slated for UAT
      - Need to ensure all parties know processes, timing, and expectations
   2.

   *Reporting Structure and Organization:*
   - Current reporting may lack necessary organization and detail
      - Need more granular visibility for both workstream readiness and
      individual process tracking, especially where business/IT handoffs ex=
ist
   3.

   *Functional Business Partner Gap:*
   - Unclear assignment of business-side UAT coordination; concern there is
      a gap between business and IT leads, specifically within certain
processes
      (e.g., finance)

------------------------------
B. SIT/UAT Timeline Escalations and Communication Breakdowns

   - *Timeline*:
      - Original SIT plan: Start June 16, 2025
      - UAT initially scheduled: June 23, 2025
      - ERP Team revised schedule, causing confusion (SIT now expected to
      start June 23, UAT after July 7)
   - *Recent Escalation:*
      - Jeff requested SIT/UAT status reports (June 12) but misalignment in
      schedules and dashboard/reporting readiness made this difficult to
      accommodate
      - Functional calibration calls revealed communication gaps within ERP
      team and affected functions

------------------------------
C. Program Structure & Ownership

   -

   *UAT Coordination:*
   - Pierce nominated as overall IT and UAT coordinator; assigned
      functional UAT coordinators for each domain (Supply Chain, Finance, H=
R,
      etc.)
      - RACI matrix exists but lacks formal meeting operating system (MOS)
      - Proposal: Rapidly formalize MOS, with defined syncs and reporting
   -

   *Reporting Requirements:*
   - Two primary dashboards discussed: =E2=80=988.1=E2=80=99 (readiness) an=
d =E2=80=98Day 1=E2=80=99
      (execution/progress)
      - Stakeholders (especially Jeff) expect granular reporting, e.g.:
         - Defects
         - Testing status by country/business process
         - Risk and readiness for each area

------------------------------
D. UAT Execution and Risk Mitigation

   -

   *Daily Execution:*
   - Recommendation: Daily scrums/standups not just for leaders, but for
      all involved in UAT
      - Set =E2=80=9Ctoday/tomorrow=E2=80=9D expectations and outcomes; est=
ablish daily
      feedback and reporting cadence
   -

   *Tracking Primary/Backup Testers:*
   - Need explicit documentation of =E2=80=9Cwho pushes the button=E2=80=9D=
 for each test,
      including named backups; reduce risk from unfamiliar users executing
      critical tests
   -

   *Vacations & Scheduling:*
   - Track known vacation schedules to avoid gaps in critical testing;
      ensure replacements are onboarded and risk is mitigated by close revi=
ew

------------------------------
E. Detailed Reporting Needs by Function/Workstream

   -

   *Example: ADP Payroll (HR):*
   - Payroll testing spans 26 countries, each with unique schedules and
      needs
      - Current reports too high-level; must include country-level details
      in dashboards/appendices
      - Trackers exist (per Sandra), but need integration into central
      UAT/defect reporting for visibility
   -

   *Finance:*
   - Finance business/technical coordination may require attention
      - 19 systems implicated in =E2=80=9Crecord to report=E2=80=9D process=
; all need named
      functional leads, testers, and test scenarios aligned with the
ERP schedule
      - Ongoing efforts to capture system-by-system readiness and risk,
      aiming to ensure all process, scripts, tester assignments, and
environment
      readiness are tracked in detail
   -

   *Supply Chain:*
   - Similarly, attention to detailed, aligned readiness tracking is needed

------------------------------
F. Tools, Systems, and Data Access

   -

   *Team Sites:*
   - Currently: Athens IT Team Site, BRV folders exist, but limited access
      (mostly IT/PMO)
      - Proposed: Dedicated and widely accessible UAT team site/channel for
      all process/function leads, testers, and stakeholders to access
      documentation, trackers, and dashboards
   -

   *Defect Tracking & Tools:*
   - Existing tools: Capital Edge (not universally available), TOSCA
      (proposed but on critical path, so not viable for now), JIRA
(standard for
      IT)
      - Plan:
         - Capture all defects/issues/enhancements/user errors via
         Microsoft Planner in Teams (for universal access)
         - =E2=80=9CTrue=E2=80=9D defects to be entered/tracked in JIRA (st=
andard defect
         reporting)
         - Output from JIRA to be used for official reporting; but Planner
         is the central, accessible capture point
         - Decision that TOSCA adds unacceptable risk given newness and
         critical path status; will not be primary UAT/defect tool

------------------------------
3. Action ItemsImmediate Next Steps

   1.

   *Establish UAT Team Site:*
   - Jessica to create a new Teams site/channel for UAT, inviting all
      business and IT stakeholders
      - Ensure document repositories, trackers, and reporting dashboards
      are accessible to all
   2.

   *Formalize UAT Meeting Operating System (MOS):*
   - Rakesh & Mac to draft and roll out a formal MOS to synchronize UAT
      activities (including meeting cadence, participant roles, and daily
      expectation setting)
      - Define and commence daily UAT scrum/standup meetings for all
      testers and function leads
   3.

   *Revise and Expand Dashboards/Reports:*
   - Add country-level details for HR/ADP payroll (Sandra=E2=80=99s tracker=
 as
      appendix/double-click)
      - For all 14 functional/process areas, build out readiness trackers
      with risk/issue identification, named testers/backups, aligned schedu=
les,
      and system/test script status
      - Ensure dashboards report on granular status by process/country, not
      just high-level summaries
   4.

   *Defect Tracking Process:*
   - Set up Microsoft Planner in Teams as catch-all for
      defects/issues/enhancements/user feedback (universally available)
      - True defects to be synchronized/copied to JIRA for official IT
      tracking, enabling consolidated executive reporting
      - Confirm with Sukai/leadership the continued use of JIRA over TOSCA
      for UAT/defect tracking due to critical path/capability concerns
   5.

   *Capture Key Tester and Vacation Coverage:*
   - Compile/validate list of all primary/backup testers for every
      process/system
      - Document all planned absences, activate cross-training or schedule
      management as needed to ensure critical coverage

------------------------------
4. Follow-up Points / Meetings

   -

   *Connect in Next 24 hours:*
   - Subgroup (Jessica, Vicki, Mac, Rakesh) to meet again promptly (no
      later than June 17) to review and refine dashboards/reporting
requirements
      - Firm up detailed needs for reporting granularity, dashboard design,
      and data sources
   -

   *MOS Rollout:*
   - Rakesh & Mac to publish finalized MOS and schedule initial daily
      standups/scrums by midweek
   -

   *Dashboard Review:*
   - Share revised dashboards (with detailed appendices for
      ADP/finance/supply chain) with all stakeholders and align on reportin=
g
      cadence
   -

   *Executive Reporting Readiness:*
   - Prepare detailed, risk-aware readiness and execution dashboards ahead
      of next OPSEP/leadership review (target: prior to next Wednesday=E2=
=80=99s call)

------------------------------
5. Outstanding Issues / Risks

   - *Reporting Lag:* Need to close the gap between existing summary data
   and the necessary detail for leadership/executive assurance
   - *Business/IT Communication:* Ongoing attention needed to bridge
   business-user and IT process gaps, especially in finance
   - *Vacations and Test Ownership:* Elevated risk if backups are not
   adequately prepared or if absences are not proactively managed
   - *Tool Criticality:* Avoid introduction of untested or unfamiliar
   tooling (e.g., TOSCA) on the critical path for UAT

------------------------------
6. Summary Statements

   - The team recognizes a pressing need for more detailed, transparent,
   and accessible UAT planning and reporting.
   - Structural interventions (team site, MOS, daily scrums, and robust
   defect tracking) are being prioritized and actioned to address
   transparency, risk mitigation, and readiness for key testing phases.
   - Follow-up sessions and tighter communication are scheduled to ensure
   readiness, stakeholder engagement, and ultimately, project success.

Jessica0:00
Helping on a bubble assignment with hr. So I've been helping HR with their
work stream now for about three months. And so my work there is kind of
coming. Coming down to a little bit of a lull. And so I'm going to start
ramping up and helping support here. But that's, I think why I'm getting
pulled in. So, Vicki, you want to introduce yourself?
Vicki0:24
Sure, sure. And Rakesh knows a little bit about why I'm here. I'm here to
support Sakai in terms.
Jessica0:30
Of what we're doing.
Vicki0:31
We've had several phone calls before this, so thanks for, you know, the
intro and all of what's happening. But my job is to really make sure that
we drive this home, home, home, that we look at every bit of opportunity,
risk, what we can do to help mitigate our risk as we're moving forward to
help peers with what he's doing in terms of working with the group, et
cetera. So she's expected me to stay on top of what's going on and to
partner with you all so that we can complete it as a team.
Rakesh1:03
Got it. So, yeah. Thanks, Vicki. So I'm the EYIT program lead for the
planning and execution for Athens. So I support primarily Paul and Sukai on
the day to day planning and execution and working across the program for
all the gate deliverables. So then you know, Mac is my colleague here that
works with me on my team to support particularly now uat. So I wear quite a
few hats. One of the current temporary hats is supporting peers on uat. And
but then I've got the remit for, you know, the day to day and I think you
saw Bill on the other call. Bill is the overall ey engagement partner for
it. There's another person, Sean as well who's currently supporting
actually the. The day to day activities for it. But between Bill and Sean,
they're the partners. It ey engagement partners. But. But again, I'm the
day to day face of this, working with Paul and Sukai and prior to that
Krista for athletes it.
Jessica2:19
Okay, so I'm just going to give you my observations. Coming in completely
blind. Oh, sorry Mac. Did you want to.
Rakesh2:31
No, I was going to say nice to meet you.
Jessica2:36
So just getting down to brass tacks, I think there's a lot going on in the
background and I'm not sure what fully stemmed this escalation, but at
least from what I'm seeing, I think that we may need to work on two areas
that I'm seeing a little bit of A gap. And Vic, you can chime in with any
comments that you have. You and I connected a little bit before this too,
so I think you have some of the same concerns. One is making sure that we
really have good communication with the people that are going to be doing
uat. But the second thing is I think we may need to ramp up some of the
reporting a little bit. Some of the things that I mentioned earlier may be
a little bit picky, but like I said, I've worked with Jeff before on uat.
I've had a report out to him, to Suresh, and I think some of the questions,
comments are coming from just maybe a little bit more organization to some
of the data and how the data is getting reported out and just making sure
that the. We're digging in a little bit to some of these work streams, to
making to make sure that they are ready to support this. And I guess one
question I had because I also reached out to one of the functional business
leads who tied to one of those 14 processes for BRV and I got some similar
feedback from this person as well, who is sort of the, I guess the
functional business partner from the Honeywell side that's really supposed
to be connecting in with each of these work streams. Is that meant to be
pierced? Is there somebody else working on this too? Does that kind of seem
to be a little of a gap? I mean it seems like, and if I'm wrong, please
correct me. Pierce seems to be really focused on some of the IT and the
technical stuff. But from like let's call it more of a business partner
function, it seems like there may be a little bit of a gap there. Does that
person exist? So Rakesh, and back, if you guys are answering, you're both
on mute.
Rakesh4:46
Yeah, sorry, apologies. I was on mute. Yes. So I will, I will answer that
your question in 30 seconds. But I wanted to give you the background of why
this, this is flaming red so early on. About a month ago, just to give you
the background again, you know, we under a few weeks ago we understood
that, you know, the ERP team said, okay, things are going to be in sit. Our
original plan coming in was that SIT would start the 16th and that UAT
would start around the 23rd. Now, since then you saw that the plans have
shifted and the ERP team has come up with a different set of calendar. So
when we originally about three weeks ago, then we told Jeff, hey, listen,
you know, apps are getting into sit on the 16th and you know, you know,
some of them are a bit early, there's a few of them that are already
happening. And so he started asking of I want to see the reports naturally.
So he sent this email last Thursday, I believe or Wednesday. And, and he
said, you know, this is actually Thursday on 12th. And he said I want to
understand all of this sit. I want to start understanding all the defects
and I want to understand all the look ahead on uat. And obviously coming
into the Friday call, you know, we got to know through the functional
calibration calls with the IT and the functions that the UAT calendar is
not till the 23rd. Actually, it's not till 7th and it's actually sit that
is starting on the 23rd. So you're absolutely right in that the
communication between the ITERP team and the rest of the functions is not
happening at a broad level. So that precipitated, given that we could not
show these dashboards for him. And I want to also show you that we are
developing some dashboards that are, you know, sort of look like this that
need further work. But you can see that, you know, they are, you know,
we'll, we'll refine this but we already have these dashboards that talk
about today. What are the apps in scope? When is the SIT UAT calendar? What
is a look ahead? So these apps, you know, we, we had them Friday but we
never got around to showing them to, to Jeff because for obvious reasons.
But coming back to your other question on Pierce, Pierce was nominated as
the IT UAT coordinator for this. Jeff also nominated him as overall UAT
lead, so to speak. Peers has counterparts in each function. So the UAT
coordinators for other functions like supply chain finance, HR are there
and we have a tracker, we have a name of a racy across all these as well as
additional PoCs for sub processes within functions so that races,
published, etc. What we do not have yet and I think I'm sharing my full
screen, so what we do not have yet is an mos. So again Mac and I put
together this MOS that we need to establish very quickly because we've been
having informal conversations and we have, we've been having these
alignment calls, but we don't have an MOS that's actually in place to say
UAT coordinators meet, you know, several times a week. We have a sync up
and a follow up. The other thing that is probably precipitating this is
Jeff asked Pierce to start updating the overall program on these Wednesday
weekly OPSEP all hands calls. Right. So unfortunate that Pierce is on
vacation but the idea was that the original thought was, hey, sit has
started UAT starting on the 23rd. You need to have got all your ducks in a
row, and you needed to have communicated this. And we need to start
reporting on defects and progress. So write intent. It's just the timing of
it now is we're not yet there, but I think the structure should still be
there. So you're spot on with your two observations that we need the
structure in place, we need this MOS setup, and then we need the reporting
structure around it so we can start reporting on the two separate
dashboards, the 8.1 dashboard and the day one dashboard.
Jessica9:04
Okay, so one I want to mention is I had a conversation with Jeff Hopkins
about this Friday, and like I said, I've worked with him in the past. So I
think if you and I and Vicki and Matt can. I don't think that this 30
minutes is going to be enough time, but in the Next, let's say 24 hours, I
think that we should connect and really start digging into what's visually
needed. This looks good, but I think that we definitely need some. Some
tweaking of this because there. And back to your other point of the mos,
There needs to be a solid mos. We have a tight timeline for this. Uat, like
these functional business leads, probably need to have meetings set up in
the morning with their team just to have set expectations in the afternoon
to make sure that everything has happened. Report out to us, and then we're
sending this out probably on a daily basis. I mean, it's that tight. Yeah,
it's that type. Yeah. Go ahead, Becky.
Vicki10:07
And go ahead, Jessica. I think you're absolutely right. I think what has to
happen is just as we have daily scrums with the leadership team, we need to
have daily scrums with everybody else. Right. We need to make sure, but we
need to set those expectations. So it needs to be today. This is what we're
going to work on, is what we're looking to accomplish. This is your
expectation. Tomorrow. This is what we're going to work on. This is your
expectation. Now, we also need to have solidify in writing vacations that
are already known. Because my other concern is that we may have user
testing, but you and I, I think all of us on this phone can agree if I'm
the person that pushes the button, button for finance, but you have
somebody else go and do it for me that doesn't push the button, we have a
higher probability of missing something that's not going to Work.
Jessica10:58
Yep.
Vicki11:00
Because I'm not used to. That person, is not used to doing it every day. So
we need to know who are the primary end users that are testing, if they're
having a backup, who is that backup, what role do they play? Because we're
going to have to pay, we're going to have to pay even more attention to
those individuals because they're not used to doing it all the time. Not
that they don't want to, not that they don't know how, but it's a double
check to mitigate our risk.
Jessica11:28
The other thing too, just as an awareness. And I don't know if you know
this Rakesh and Mac, but I was talking with, I was talking with Sandra on
HR stuff because I've been working with HR Workstream just to pick her
brain a little bit. Because for example, in the PowerPoint that you guys
showed earlier. Hold on, I have it up, I'm just gonna.
Rakesh11:48
And I've actually updated the slides as well. So they're, you know, they're
a bit different than what I showed you in the morning because I've got some
updates.
Jessica11:56
But yeah, well, so, and here's some of the things that like again having
worked with Jeff in the past, some of the things I think he's going to want
to have a little bit more information than just like a high level executive
summary. So and, or maybe have it as an addenda. But ADP payroll, her and I
got on the topic of ADP payroll and she said that for ADP there's actually
going to be, there's 26 countries that they have a separate ADP partner.
And so each one of the UAT slash sit testing is going to be done on
slightly different schedules based on the different countries. And I said,
you know, that's something that I think we need to have a little bit more
detailed reporting because right now we just say adp, if we don't have any
of those details and she has all of a tracker, the information is there.
But I think for the purposes of Jeff and opsep, especially around things
like pay anything related, financials, anything, people compensation,
there's gonna be high visibility to that. And so I said if it were me, I'd
want to see all 26 countries. Like I'd want to see her tracker, even if
it's in the appendix, to say, hey, are we on, on task or on target? For all
of them, even if only one is not on target, I would not have this as green.
Now I don't know if any are off track. But like that's just the high level
digging in with ADP that I think we need better visibility into those
different tests and I want to make sure that if there's something like that
happening for all of these other 14 or 13, I guess, processes that we have
enough of a tick and tie into that with that business partner to know where
our risks are. Like looking at this kind of time back into what Vicky was
saying earlier, think about risks. I don't have a confidence looking at
this table that we know where our risks are right now and we might, but
it's not portrayed in here.
Rakesh13:51
No. Fully agree with you. This is a more of an executive summary on
readiness. It's not about the actual schedule. This is readiness to when
that will be done. So to your point, the last line on ADP payroll changes.
Yes. Sandra has a tracker. I agree. I think we should add that detail
tracker as a double click and it will be the dashboard. This is to say that
I know that there's a UAT between 7:1 and 731 across those 26 countries for
parallel payroll processing. Have I aligned the UAT schedule? Yes, that's
complete for those 26 countries that you just mentioned. Have I identified
testers? It's all done by adp. So yes. So they've identified the testers or
they will in this week. Have I. Have they developed the test script? So
again, this is a march to readiness. It's not a double click necessarily
into the actual thing. But I agree with you, when we go into the dashboard,
the dashboard, if I double click on that last line of payroll, should have.
Here's my schedule for across the 26 countries. This is my test dates. This
is the aligned test dates. These are the aligned, you know, procedures and
test scripts and the timing, etc. Etc. So I agree with you, this is more of
a summary of readiness because that's what Sukhai wanted as well to say how
ready are we to do this for 7 7.
Jessica15:15
Fair point. And, and I know I'm coming in completely blind.
Rakesh15:19
No. Which is perfectly fine. Which is good actually because it's.
Jessica15:21
Yeah, yeah. I'm here to pick holes.
Rakesh15:25
Absolutely. Yep.
Jessica15:27
And I'm less concerned about HR because having worked with that work
stream, I do know how organized like Vicki and Kelly. My concern, and again
I haven't dug in fully is I think really more with finance because I don't
know that finance, the business users have some of the maybe technical
needs and there may be a, called a communication gap between like the it
and the business leads just kind of what I'm picking up. I could be wrong.
Rakesh15:55
Not necessarily, I mean. Well, you tell me more because we've had the
alignment calls with the finance team, Will Johnson and his team.
Vicki16:04
Yeah.
Rakesh16:04
And all of his sub process leads have been on these alignment calls with us
to align on what are these seven systems that are where changes are
happening versus plus the other adjacent systems that get touched as part
of say a recorded report end to end process testing. So we have those
details and you know, again, these are trackers again data that we have
that we. Mac and I were just talking a bit earlier about including in a
tracker. So for example, when I look at, you know, this tracker that is
from them, you know, you could see that, okay, I have seven systems. I
actually have, you know, 19 systems I'm touching as part of this record to
report process. And this is the alignment calls that we had with them line
by line to say, you know, this is an itpm, this is the disposition, this
is, you know, we have action items that there will be some validations by
today or tomorrow and some action items or activities that are still
pending here. But we've identified the leads, identified the scenarios. By
the 17th the scenarios will be finalized in the test scripts. There are all
these comments as part of these alignment calls that we've been going
through with them to say I've got 19 systems in scope for my finance end to
end process testing and you know, we understand the environments they're in
and the next step is to actually work through the same readiness schedule,
if you will, to say for these finance systems and likely we should now
include, you know, when we double click we'll include the other for all 19
we will be tracking, you know, is, you know, is the schedule aligned with
the ERP schedule? You know, have we identified, we've identified function
leads, but have we identified individual testers and the backups as you
mentioned, have we developed the test scripts for those 19 and have we, you
know, is the system ready? Am I using QA Environment for All 19 or you
know, is it a sandbox for one and a QA for the other? That level of detail
will have to be in the tracker that we can start dashboarding. So again,
exactly, higher level summary here, but a double click is available, not
all the data, but we need to close the gaps here because we do have most of
the data here in the detailed alignment sessions that we've been having
with them.
Jessica18:29
Okay.
Rakesh18:32
Same for supply chain.
Jessica18:33
Yeah. Okay, so getting back to something a little Bit more tactical. First
question is, do you guys already have a team site that everybody has access
to.
Rakesh18:46
IT and several business functions have access to but there's not a separate
team site for end to end UAT etc.
Vicki18:58
Also question on that for Mr. Jessica. When you said they have individual
team sites, what's the purpose of those team sites? Do you know?
Rakesh19:08
Is that to me or to you? No, I'm saying no, no. It has an Athens IT team
site and we've got BRV folders. Whether that will suffice for a centralized
coordination? For now, only mostly IT team members have access to it. The
whole PMO and IT functions incrementally are getting access to it, but I
don't think all the functional leads have access to that particular IT
Teams folder. So perhaps the short answer to you Jessica, is that we need a
separate team site or a channel that we cater fully to UAT and you know,
BRV and non brv and we have everybody, whoever is involved in IT given
access to it. So short answer is no, not in the current construction today.
Jessica20:04
Okay, let me do this. I'll create a team site for uat. One of my other
concerns too long term for the businesses, I want them to have access to
all this information. So if there is any issues down the line, we know what
was tested, what wasn't tested. You know, is this a gap? We can use it for
lessons Learned, especially before 11:1. The second part of this is defect
tracking because it's another one that Jeff brought up to me explicitly.
Rakesh20:31
Sure.
Jessica20:32
Here's what I would recommend because I know that you guys have Capital
Edge, but not everybody has asked them. My recommendation is that we
leverage planner and teams and put all of the quote unquote defects in
there. We use the columns to organize information because some of it's
going to be defects, some of it's going to be enhancement that people don't
realize are enhancements. Some of it's just going to be user error.
Organize all the information and that anything that is a true defect. If
you guys want to track that in Capital Edge, you can then copy that into
Capital Edge. But I think we need to have a Honeywell owned system that at
least is the capture of all the information and then you guys can track it
outside of there if you want to. But we need a place to capture everything
that everybody has access to.
Rakesh21:23
So I think a very good point and I think let's keep it very simple and do
that. Now the tool they're using, I think Sukai is going to make a decision
whether it's going back to JIRA or like or this new tool, Tosca, that is an
integrated tool that manages all the execution. You know, it's the
automated script generation, execution. So the intention from the team that
put out Tosca was that everybody goes in. The, the IT team goes in for sit,
but the functional users, focals go in, or the super users and power users
go in for uat. They go into the tool, they track, they execute, they track
defects, they fix it, they report on it. That tool should have a
comprehensive output like JIRA standard reporting there. So we may not need
additional other than you take reports out of it and you provide to, you
know, we're able to provide to Jeff to say, I ran 10 scenarios, you know, I
ran 47 scripts, you know, 43, executed four redos, three defects. I think
that standard reporting is available in that TOSCA tool. So.
Jessica22:30
Hold on.
Vicki22:31
Stop. Based on the call we had this morning, if TOSCA is on a critical
path, the answer is no. She already said that. So let's answer the
question. Is Tosca on the critical path? From everything that I have been
told, it is on a critical path. And because everybody's learning it, it's
brand new, we don't know it, the answer would be we're not using TSCA if
that's the case, because we can't have it on the critical path and
introduce the extra risk. So my first question is, do you agree that TSCA
is on a critical path? And if so, then you also mentioned that we might be
using JIRA as part of our defect tracking.
Rakesh23:12
No, no. What I said is similar to jira. It has the same capabilities. So if
you. Yeah, I agree it's on critical path. And obviously that erp. Well,
Sukai and the leadership, if they made the decision that TOSCA is not to be
used, then the default, I think in Honeywell is Jira. And JIRA has all the
capability, so all of the defect tracking and reporting can come out of
jira. So whereas going with that is we may not need to create a planner. We
may be able to fully leverage JIRA to report out on all the defects.
Jessica23:48
So I hear what you're saying, but I still think we need the planner because
the actual everybody has access. That's my concern. The actual defect
tracking, I 100% agree, should be done in Jira. So my, my. Let me restate
it a slightly different way is I think.

ting down to brass tacks, I think there&#39;s a lot going on in the backgro=
und and I&#39;m not sure what fully stemmed this escalation, but at least f=
rom what I&#39;m seeing, I think that we may need to work on two areas that=
 I&#39;m seeing a little bit of A gap. And Vic, you can chime in with any c=
omments that you have. You and I connected a little bit before this too, so=
 I think you have some of the same concerns. One is making sure that we rea=
lly have good communication with the people that are going to be doing uat.=
 But the second thing is I think we may need to ramp up some of the reporti=
ng a little bit. Some of the things that I mentioned earlier may be a littl=
e bit picky, but like I said, I&#39;ve worked with Jeff before on uat. I&#3=
9;ve had a report out to him, to Suresh, and I think some of the questions,=
 comments are coming from just maybe a little bit more organization to some=
 of the data and how the data is getting reported out and just making sure =
that the. We&#39;re digging in a little bit to some of these work streams, =
to making to make sure that they are ready to support this. And I guess one=
 question I had because I also reached out to one of the functional busines=
s leads who tied to one of those 14 processes for BRV and I got some simila=
r feedback from this person as well, who is sort of the, I guess the functi=
onal business partner from the Honeywell side that&#39;s really supposed to=
 be connecting in with each of these work streams. Is that meant to be pier=
ced? Is there somebody else working on this too? Does that kind of seem to =
be a little of a gap? I mean it seems like, and if I&#39;m wrong, please co=
rrect me. Pierce seems to be really focused on some of the IT and the techn=
ical stuff. But from like let&#39;s call it more of a business partner func=
tion, it seems like there may be a little bit of a gap there. Does that per=
son exist? So Rakesh, and back, if you guys are answering, you&#39;re both =
on mute.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backgroun=

ght:1.6">Yeah, sorry, apologies. I was on mute. Yes. So I will, I will answ=
er that your question in 30 seconds. But I wanted to give you the backgroun=
d of why this, this is flaming red so early on. About a month ago, just to =
give you the background again, you know, we under a few weeks ago we unders=
tood that, you know, the ERP team said, okay, things are going to be in sit=
. Our original plan coming in was that SIT would start the 16th and that UA=
T would start around the 23rd. Now, since then you saw that the plans have =
shifted and the ERP team has come up with a different set of calendar. So w=
hen we originally about three weeks ago, then we told Jeff, hey, listen, yo=
u know, apps are getting into sit on the 16th and you know, you know, some =
of them are a bit early, there&#39;s a few of them that are already happeni=
ng. And so he started asking of I want to see the reports naturally. So he =
sent this email last Thursday, I believe or Wednesday. And, and he said, yo=
u know, this is actually Thursday on 12th. And he said I want to understand=
 all of this sit. I want to start understanding all the defects and I want =
to understand all the look ahead on uat. And obviously coming into the Frid=
ay call, you know, we got to know through the functional calibration calls =
with the IT and the functions that the UAT calendar is not till the 23rd. A=
ctually, it&#39;s not till 7th and it&#39;s actually sit that is starting o=
n the 23rd. So you&#39;re absolutely right in that the communication betwee=
n the ITERP team and the rest of the functions is not happening at a broad =
level. So that precipitated, given that we could not show these dashboards =
for him. And I want to also show you that we are developing some dashboards=
 that are, you know, sort of look like this that need further work. But you=
 can see that, you know, they are, you know, we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll refine th=
is but we already have these dashboards that talk about today. What are the=
 apps in scope? When is the SIT UAT calendar? What is a look ahead? So thes=
e apps, you know, we, we had them Friday but we never got around to showing=
 them to, to Jeff because for obvious reasons. But coming back to your othe=
r question on Pierce, Pierce was nominated as the IT UAT coordinator for th=
is. Jeff also nominated him as overall UAT lead, so to speak. Peers has cou=
nterparts in each function. So the UAT coordinators for other functions lik=
e supply chain finance, HR are there and we have a tracker, we have a name =
of a racy across all these as well as additional PoCs for sub processes wit=
hin functions so that races, published, etc. What we do not have yet and I =
think I&#39;m sharing my full screen, so what we do not have yet is an mos.=
 So again Mac and I put together this MOS that we need to establish very qu=
ickly because we&#39;ve been having informal conversations and we have, we&=
#39;ve been having these alignment calls, but we don&#39;t have an MOS that=
&#39;s actually in place to say UAT coordinators meet, you know, several ti=
mes a week. We have a sync up and a follow up. The other thing that is prob=
ably precipitating this is Jeff asked Pierce to start updating the overall =
program on these Wednesday weekly OPSEP all hands calls. Right. So unfortun=
ate that Pierce is on vacation but the idea was that the original thought w=
as, hey, sit has started UAT starting on the 23rd. You need to have got all=
 your ducks in a row, and you needed to have communicated this. And we need=
 to start reporting on defects and progress. So write intent. It&#39;s just=
 the timing of it now is we&#39;re not yet there, but I think the structure=
 should still be there. So you&#39;re spot on with your two observations th=
at we need the structure in place, we need this MOS setup, and then we need=
 the reporting structure around it so we can start reporting on the two sep=
arate dashboards, the 8.1 dashboard and the day one dashboard.</div></div><=

that we should connect and really start digging into what&#39;s visually ne=
eded. This looks good, but I think that we definitely need some. Some tweak=
ing of this because there. And back to your other point of the mos, There n=
eeds to be a solid mos. We have a tight timeline for this. Uat, like these =
functional business leads, probably need to have meetings set up in the mor=
ning with their team just to have set expectations in the afternoon to make=
 sure that everything has happened. Report out to us, and then we&#39;re se=

;s some of the things that like again having worked with Jeff in the past, =
some of the things I think he&#39;s going to want to have a little bit more=
 information than just like a high level executive summary. So and, or mayb=
e have it as an addenda. But ADP payroll, her and I got on the topic of ADP=
 payroll and she said that for ADP there&#39;s actually going to be, there&=
#39;s 26 countries that they have a separate ADP partner. And so each one o=
f the UAT slash sit testing is going to be done on slightly different sched=
ules based on the different countries. And I said, you know, that&#39;s som=
ething that I think we need to have a little bit more detailed reporting be=
cause right now we just say adp, if we don&#39;t have any of those details =
and she has all of a tracker, the information is there. But I think for the=
 purposes of Jeff and opsep, especially around things like pay anything rel=
ated, financials, anything, people compensation, there&#39;s gonna be high =
visibility to that. And so I said if it were me, I&#39;d want to see all 26=
 countries. Like I&#39;d want to see her tracker, even if it&#39;s in the a=
ppendix, to say, hey, are we on, on task or on target? For all of them, eve=
n if only one is not on target, I would not have this as green. Now I don&#=
39;t know if any are off track. But like that&#39;s just the high level dig=
ging in with ADP that I think we need better visibility into those differen=
t tests and I want to make sure that if there&#39;s something like that hap=
pening for all of these other 14 or 13, I guess, processes that we have eno=
ugh of a tick and tie into that with that business partner to know where ou=
r risks are. Like looking at this kind of time back into what Vicky was say=
ing earlier, think about risks. I don&#39;t have a confidence looking at th=
is table that we know where our risks are right now and we might, but it&#3=
9;s not portrayed in here.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padd=

executive summary on readiness. It&#39;s not about the actual schedule. Thi=
s is readiness to when that will be done. So to your point, the last line o=
n ADP payroll changes. Yes. Sandra has a tracker. I agree. I think we shoul=
d add that detail tracker as a double click and it will be the dashboard. T=
his is to say that I know that there&#39;s a UAT between 7:1 and 731 across=
 those 26 countries for parallel payroll processing. Have I aligned the UAT=
 schedule? Yes, that&#39;s complete for those 26 countries that you just me=
ntioned. Have I identified testers? It&#39;s all done by adp. So yes. So th=
ey&#39;ve identified the testers or they will in this week. Have I. Have th=
ey developed the test script? So again, this is a march to readiness. It&#3=
9;s not a double click necessarily into the actual thing. But I agree with =
you, when we go into the dashboard, the dashboard, if I double click on tha=
t last line of payroll, should have. Here&#39;s my schedule for across the =
26 countries. This is my test dates. This is the aligned test dates. These =
are the aligned, you know, procedures and test scripts and the timing, etc.=
 Etc. So I agree with you, this is more of a summary of readiness because t=
hat&#39;s what Sukhai wanted as well to say how ready are we to do this for=

talking a bit earlier about including in a tracker. So for example, when I =
look at, you know, this tracker that is from them, you know, you could see =
that, okay, I have seven systems. I actually have, you know, 19 systems I&#=
39;m touching as part of this record to report process. And this is the ali=

at there will be some validations by today or tomorrow and some action item=
s or activities that are still pending here. But we&#39;ve identified the l=
eads, identified the scenarios. By the 17th the scenarios will be finalized=
 in the test scripts. There are all these comments as part of these alignme=

 systems in scope for my finance end to end process testing and you know, w=

finance systems and likely we should now include, you know, when we double =
click we&#39;ll include the other for all 19 we will be tracking, you know,=
 is, you know, is the schedule aligned with the ERP schedule? You know, hav=
e we identified, we&#39;ve identified function leads, but have we identifie=
d individual testers and the backups as you mentioned, have we developed th=
e test scripts for those 19 and have we, you know, is the system ready? Am =
I using QA Environment for All 19 or you know, is it a sandbox for one and =
a QA for the other? That level of detail will have to be in the tracker tha=
t we can start dashboarding. So again, exactly, higher level summary here, =
but a double click is available, not all the data, but we need to close the=
 gaps here because we do have most of the data here in the detailed alignme=

No, I&#39;m saying no, no. It has an Athens IT team site and we&#39;ve got =
BRV folders. Whether that will suffice for a centralized coordination? For =
now, only mostly IT team members have access to it. The whole PMO and IT fu=
nctions incrementally are getting access to it, but I don&#39;t think all t=
he functional leads have access to that particular IT Teams folder. So perh=
aps the short answer to you Jessica, is that we need a separate team site o=
r a channel that we cater fully to UAT and you know, BRV and non brv and we=
 have everybody, whoever is involved in IT given access to it. So short ans=

er and teams and put all of the quote unquote defects in there. We use the =
columns to organize information because some of it&#39;s going to be defect=
s, some of it&#39;s going to be enhancement that people don&#39;t realize a=
re enhancements. Some of it&#39;s just going to be user error. Organize all=
 the information and that anything that is a true defect. If you guys want =
to track that in Capital Edge, you can then copy that into Capital Edge. Bu=
t I think we need to have a Honeywell owned system that at least is the cap=
ture of all the information and then you guys can track it outside of there=
 if you want to. But we need a place to capture everything that everybody h=
as access to.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;back=

ery simple and do that. Now the tool they&#39;re using, I think Sukai is go=
ing to make a decision whether it&#39;s going back to JIRA or like or this =
new tool, Tosca, that is an integrated tool that manages all the execution.=
 You know, it&#39;s the automated script generation, execution. So the inte=
ntion from the team that put out Tosca was that everybody goes in. The, the=
 IT team goes in for sit, but the functional users, focals go in, or the su=
per users and power users go in for uat. They go into the tool, they track,=
 they execute, they track defects, they fix it, they report on it. That too=
l should have a comprehensive output like JIRA standard reporting there. So=
 we may not need additional other than you take reports out of it and you p=
rovide to, you know, we&#39;re able to provide to Jeff to say, I ran 10 sce=
narios, you know, I ran 47 scripts, you know, 43, executed four redos, thre=
e defects. I think that standard reporting is available in that TOSCA tool.=

 it, it&#39;s brand new, we don&#39;t know it, the answer would be we&#39;r=

the leadership, if they made the decision that TOSCA is not to be used, the=
n the default, I think in Honeywell is Jira. And JIRA has all the capabilit=
