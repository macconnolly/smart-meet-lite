Automation, Tracking, Severity, and Hypercare Coordination

# Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 May 30, 2025

## Attendees
- 8 active participants (including Organizer, External, and Unverified =
members)
- 2 additional invitees with no response
- Detailed status of =
attendees described under **Images**

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Automation for Order Management and Hypercare
- Proposal to automate the process of updating orders when incorrect entity=
 or bank account information is received.
  - The system would correct the =
Purchase Order Service Order (POSO), notify the customer, and prompt them =
to update records.
- Goal: Reduce manual Hypercare effort and minimize =
business disruption.
- Point tabled for end-of-meeting return, emphasizing =
future potential.

### 2. Project Planning and Readiness Tracking
#### a. Current Project Status
- Activities covered: Knowledge Transfer =
(KT), System Integration Testing (SIT), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), =
Go-Live Readiness, Hypercare.
- Post-kickoff steps included resource =
identification and assignment of roles/responsibilities.
- **Current delay**: Resource tracker not fully populated by May 23, as =
targeted; ongoing follow-up to close gaps.
- Alignment across IT =
workstreams and business functions is in progress to clarify =
responsibilities, processes, and data flows.

#### b. Dashboard and =
Tracking Tools
- Sample dashboards and trackers in use:
  - BRV Tracker (for business readiness and hiring plan)
  - UAT Readiness Tracker (UAT progression, owner assignments, issue =
tracking)
- Emphasis on presenting clear visualizations for UAT progress, =
including:
  - Application name and leaders (Business & IT)
  - Progression status (e.g., SIT, UAT) with simple heat map colors =
(green/orange/red)
  - Insights on defect/incidents by severity (Critical, =
Major, Minor, etc.)
  - Week-on-week trend analysis for open vs. closed =
issues and backlog build-up
  - Ability to drill down for specific issue =
types and major disruptions

### 3. Framework for Issue Severity and =
Triaging
- Structured levels for issue severity:
  - Critical: Showstoppers=
, risks to business continuity, must be fixed for Go-Live.
  - High: Major, but with workarounds.
  - Medium & Low: Non-blocking, =
lower priority.
- Agreement that consistency and qualitative assessment are=
 more important than rigid user counts.
- Questions raised about the =
arbiter of severity:
  - Suggestion: Trained users submit severity, but =
must be audited, especially for High/Critical issues.
  - Training customer service and IT desks with FAQs anticipated.
  - Discussion of possibly leveraging an AI tool to analyze and assign =
severity in future implementations, once adequate training data is gathered=
.

### 4. Centralized Issue Tracking and Governance
- Need for:
  - A single, central issue tracker visible across IT and business.
  - A dedicated team (including a coordinator, possibly divided by time =
zones) to own the backlog and severity tagging.
- The escalation/triage =
process should follow "follow-the-sun" model:
  - Regional leads (existing =
legal entities or LES resources, e.g., Olga for EMEA) coordinate handoffs =
across APAC, EMEA, Americas.
  - Each region provides daily pulse checks to=
 feed into global status calls.

### 5. UAT & SIT Schedule and Reporting
- First UATs scheduled for June 20, with some "light touch" systems =
beginning around June 13.
- ~40 UAT items currently identified (precise =
number to be confirmed post-meeting).
- Supply chain SITs underway (20+ =
active), with additional activity in ERP space.
- Proposal: Start reporting=
 SIT metrics using the UAT-style dashboard/framework now to validate =
approach ahead of scale-up.
- Weekly (initially, then potentially daily) =
progress updates recommended, starting next Friday.
=20
### 6. Communication and Socialization for Hypercare
- Framework must be simplified for communication with ops leadership =
(OpSep) and for visibility in BRB workshops.
- Intake channels (helpdesk, =
customer service) need preparation in July with training/FAQs to handle =
anticipated known issues prior to August business ramp-up.

---

## Action Items

- **Resource Tracker Completion**: Continue chasing =
business functions to submit resource names for the tracker (past May 23 =
deadline).
- **Dashboard Refinement**: Rakesh to add the missing Hypercare =
dashboard sample to materials shared with Paul and others.
- **Dashboard Practice Run**: Begin using SIT data to pilot the UAT-style =
dashboard next week.
- **Weekly Reporting**: Schedule recurring Friday =
updates/report-outs starting next week; reassess frequency as Go-Live nears=
.
- **Severity Definition Training**: Develop and distribute consistent =
severity definitions and train intake teams (FAQs, scenario Walkthroughs).
- **AI Use Case Exploration**: Connect Paul with Monica and the appropriate=
 AI project team to consider using current implementation as AI severity =
pilot.
- **Central Issue Tracker Setup**: Confirm ownership and process for=
 a single cross-functional incident tracker.
- **Regional Coordination**: =
Clarify the assignment and IT involvement for regional coordinators =
(=E2=80=9Ctwo-in-the-box=E2=80=9D model where needed).
- **Ops Socialization**: Prepare simplified Hypercare story for OpSep and =
BRB workshop on June 25.
- **Progress Update**: Sukai and Jeff to =
coordinate with PS2 for next Friday scheduling and dashboard rollout.

---

## Follow-up

- Confirm precise numbers of current SITs and UATs; Rakesh to=
 provide to Jeff.
- Paul to connect with Monica regarding AI learning and =
pilot options.
- Prepare communication materials and training content for =
July intake channel readiness.
- BRB workshop agenda for June 25 to include=
 preview of Hypercare and reporting dashboards.
- Ongoing: Review =
effectiveness of reporting framework and adjust as necessary.

### Meeting Platform Screenshot

- **Invite Management**: Top =
bar allows sharing invites or dialing participants directly.
- **Participant Status**:
  - Eight attendees shown, with clear markers for=
 role (Organizer), external affiliation, and verification status.
  - Two persons invited with no response, plus one additional unverified =
recent addition to the chat.
- **Relevance**:
  - Visual demonstrates =
attention to security (external/unverified status).
  - Confirms healthy participation and identifies potential onboarding =
issues for unverified users.
  - Useful for tracking attendance and =
follow-up responsibility, especially as roles and assignments are =
solidified in project trackers.

Entity or an old bank account and then have it change that POSO to the =
right entity and send a note back to the customer that says we've amended =
this order with the right information. You need to make sure you change it =
in the system because that automation would greatly cut down on the effort =
that we would need in Hypercare on that on the commercial side and just =
reduce the overall business disruption. So anyway, I just, I, I didn't want=
 to lose the thought. We can come back to it at the end, but with that, =
Rakesh, I'll turn it over to you. Why don't you take us through the slides?

0:34
Yeah, so absolutely. Give me a second here. So again, I think a lot =
of these, you know, a few of these we have touched upon that you point out.=
 I think we've added in the appendix Sukhai and Jeff, so we'll certainly go=
 through that. But again, I think this is just level setting. So to the =
points you made, kt, uat, go live readiness, Hypercare, really the series =
of activities happening there, I think where we are and what we've done =
after the kickoff is identify resources, you know, the roles, =
responsibilities. There are some gaps in there. We have a tracker that =
we're still refining that. Actually, frankly, we're a bit behind because we=
 said we would do that. We'd have all the names in from all the functions =
and it by 523 and it's, you know, a few days later, so we're still chasing =
people for that. And I think that's going to set up you peers to make sure =
that you have all the names and you're successful here. But again that's =
something we're tracking behind on. But again I think we've seen this view =
of yes, the teams are going through SIT right now, the IT teams, they're =
developing all the test scripts for it. From what we heard, we're setting =
up those connects between IT work streams and the respective functions to =
align on what are the processes in play, what are the systems to be touched=
, what information flows through, what's available. So that's still work in=
 progress over the next couple of weeks. But again this is how the sequence=
 of events is planned for Obviously I think you and the PMO have the hiring=
 plan tracking in place so that will tell us when seats are in the right =
roles and KT has happened or what the status of that is to support the UAT =
readiness. So again, all of these will be in that tracker, both in the BRB =
tracker as well as the UAT readiness tracker. That will support it. But =
again, I just want to lay that out and I think part of.

2:29
That'S a sample dashboard of what this is going to look like. So we're =
going to get together, we're going to have some frequency of communication =
on uat. You're going to come into this meeting and say here's where we are =
on uat. What's that going to look like?

2:45
Yeah, so we do have some BRV =
tracker. What I've not included here. Paul, let me make sure I have a view =
into that. There are certain things around. There are some dashboards on =
Hypercare, but particularly around. Let me go back in here, let me get that=
 to you. It looks like I did not include that particular dashboard here as =
a sample. But we do have that and I.

3:14
Would like us to work backwards =
from the end in mind with me, myself and Sukai as the customer. So let me =
tell you what I would want that to show. I would want to see the =
application, the uat, what the application is. I would want to see who the =
business UAT leader is, who the IT UAT leader is. And then I would want to =
see the progression of the stages of that application testing for the =
things that you laid out in there. So it could just be a block almost of =
showing like you know, how much progression and some sort of a heat map on =
how it's going to hey, we're in sit. Sit's green, sit's red, sit's orange. =
And then on the forward ones for things that we're not yet into, like if =
we're going to say we're doing sit, SAT sign off, then we're going to uat. =
Then what is the projected start date for the uat? Right. Then I would want=
 to see a readout of the number of, you know, defects or issues or and if =
we want to just call like anything a defect, a training defect, an IT =
defect, a data defect, they're all defects, they're all issue. We don't =
call it defect. We could say they're issues.

4:37
Incidents.

4:38
Yeah right. They're non duplicated tickets. It's incidents. Whatever you =
want to use for terminology. But I just want that, that, that sense check =
of how noisy is it, how well is it going and you know, what is the total, =
what is the, you know, critical, major, high, major, low, minor, whatever =
terminology you choose. And then I'd like to see week on week is what's the=
 trend line? Are we growing our defects or are we decreasing our defects? =
And it doesn't have to be like super Sophisticated. It could just be an =
arrow to the side, to the up, to the down. You know, we may, on certain =
ones, want to drill down into the specifics of those and then any =
commentary on the side.

5:28
And the key there, Jeff too, is not just =
opened, but, but how we're building a backlog, right, because there's going=
 to be weeks that we open more than we close, and then it develops a =
backlog that we have to close tickets in order to get. So you see on this =
chart right here, you see the trend lines of open and close, but then you =
see the, the open count of what we're actually working with in any given =
week.

5:47
Yeah, yeah. So I think this could. I just, you know, we're =
gonna. What, what we're gonna. I mean, this is gonna be good at a high =
level, but then we're going to need to. Because all applications are not =
created equal. If this is HCM or this is ERP makes up 90% of this, then =
that's going to be bad. If ERP and ACM are like 5% of this and it's other, =
you know, it's, it's Documentum or it's Team center or it's something =
that's really impacting one function. It's still important, but. But it's =
not gonna be a threat to business continuity. Right. So what needs to come =
out of this is we need that triaging with your expertise, with data =
supporting it that we're, Sukai and I are applying our focus in the areas =
that need our focus. Whether that's chasing users to get their testing done=
 or it's, you know, making sure our leadership is aware that we have a =
major issue that could impact our ability, you know, or the quality of our =
go live because the HCM is running behind. You know, that's what we need to=
 be able to get, get out of this. And so if we could just see it. It's =
helpful for me to understand, you know, the volume of testing that's going =
on at any one time because, you know, it will help me think about how hard =
I press the functions on other things because I don't want to like, give =
them a bunch of mandatory things to do right in the middle of a bunch of =
testing that they need to do on the IT things. And we might, you know, =
think about how we want to spread things out. Or I may go to, we may go to =
the functions in OPSEP and say, say commercial. You've got like 10 UAT's =
next week. Do you have the capacity, do you have the people set aside for =
this. Right. It's just there's going to be a lot going on. The number of =
issues that have flown into my desk today is like record high for a Friday.=
 So I can tell we're, we're getting close to the go live because of the =
number of thorny issues that are rolling in. And it's only gonna. It's only=
 gonna get worse. Right? It's gonna. And so we need a robust process for it=
.

8:07
Yeah. Just a couple comments to that point. I think that, you know,=
 we'll bring something back to you on that. Around this entire process is =
some pieces of this are very linear. Right. Where the first thing that we =
have to look at is KT enables uat. In order to enable kt, we have to get =
the hiring and the receivers and the catchers, all that stuff. Right. So =
that left to right is something that we have contemplated in the data model=
 that we'll have reporting for. The other thing that I just wanted to =
comment on is around that you made a comment around the taxonomy of =
severity. Not only is that important for normalizing, you know, what's =
critical to go live, but it's also going to be in what we're proposing here=
, part of the exit criteria of defining a successful completion of UAT to =
call it done. We don't want it to be subjective. Right.

8:56
Yeah, this is absolutely critical. So I like, I like four levels, I think, =
you know, low, medium, high, critical. You know, for me, critical is a =
showstopper. It's like, it's a risk to business continuity. It's a. We =
can't go live with it because of the severity of the. It's a block. Right. =
High is again, I like the impact, but it's that there is a workaround, but =
it's a significant many work. So actually your definitions align perfectly =
with the way that I think about it. The user count is less, you know.

9:40
Yeah. In this context it's not. Yeah, it's. Yes, fair enough.

9:44
This is a somewhat qualitative and I'm completely comfortable with this =
being a qualitative process. Right. It's just that it needs to be a =
consistent qualitative process. So my question will be, who is the single =
arbiter of the severity? Who's going to audit that and how does it get set?=
 So when someone reports a ticket, do they put in the severity? Because we =
train everybody and we give them this and they put in the severity. If =
that's the process, which I'm fine with that process, someone's going to =
need to go through those and say, nah, that's bullshit. That's not critical=
. Right. Because otherwise people put everything in as critical because =
they want it resolved in two hours.

10:29
See, that's, that's part of it, =
I think as well, Jeff is part of the, you know, when you look at the =
hypercare and triaging that we, you know, talk about and you know, what is =
level zero, Level one, you know, it is, okay, there is, you know, it comes =
in again, illustrative. But there is that, that vetting process up front =
based on FAQs, based on the training to understand what is this impact. And=
 they go through this sort of filtering before it gets in, into the rest of=
 the process. So, yeah, you are spot on. I think some of that what I've =
seen we've done is, you know, again, FAQs and education and train everybody=
 ahead of time, particularly the service desk, on recognizing that severity=
.

11:16
I think it'll be good to have another person that's going to be =
the auditor. And I think just the reason why is while we will train people =
as much as we can, certain people will still put things as critical because=
 they feel it's critical. In their minds it's critical. But I think that =
auditor, as they're looking at the holistic view, I think that person will =
be able to better say, yeah, this is not a critical. Again, they won't be =
auditing everything. They'll probably stay at the high and the critical. =
But I do think it's going to be key for us to have someone that's auditing =
this massive list that's going to be coming in.

11:52
Sukhai, why couldn't we train an AI model to do that?

11:57
Yeah, I would say the thing about the AI model is you would have to add to =
already created, tested it and learned before you deploy it.

12:08
So maybe just because we're going to be processing a lot of data across a =
lot of different applications, what would it take for us? What would it =
take in terms of the way we would want to structure the data in the process=
, that we could then take that data afterwards and turn that into an AI =
model that you could use ongoing for winter. Right. But also for all of =
your other IT cutovers. Right. Wouldn't that be somebody typed in, in plain=
 language what the issue is? We have that broken out AI reads it and builds=
 it and then assigns the severity to it so that you eliminate the reliance =
on the individual to do it. But. And you also eliminate the need for =
somebody to, you know, to try to check it and go through that. And we drive=
 that consistency.

13:06
Yeah.

13:07
I just think it's a perfect use case=
, and we should. Even if we can't monetize it for Athens, if we could use =
the Athens to train the data, you could leverage that on Winter, and you =
could leverage that on every other IT implementation that you get.

13:22
That use case. And we're deploying it on one of Dinesh's ERP projects =
because it's small, it's contained, it's easy. No one's depending on it. =
But let me talk back to the team that's in front of. And I think, Paul, I =
put you in touch with Monica, but let me connect with that team. They =
weren't planning to use this as their test model. They wanted something =
smaller and easier. But let me connect with them to find out if they could =
use this one versus the ERP project.

13:51
It could be both. It could just=
 be, how do you want us to set up the data? And when people enter the =
ticket. Right. And then we're gonna. There's gonna be something. They're =
gonna have a point of view on it, and then we're gonna have a point of view=
 on it. And, you know, that ticket status. I don't know. It was just a =
thought, I think. I like that there's some opportunity here.

14:11
Yeah. I will say, Jeff, like, it is critical to have one central kind of =
issue tracker where you can see kind of critical IT issues as well as =
critical business issues. Right. Like things like payroll isn't functioning=
. Right. Or certain suppliers are not able to process orders or things like=
 that. And I do think that a central team has to kind of own that issue =
list, and that'll kind of be part of their role, is ensuring that =
criticality is appropriately tagged. Because even if you think about, like,=
 on a weekly basis. Right. We want that full list, and we'd want, like, a =
curated summary of that list to sort of report back to yourself, to report =
up, you know, to GREV or what have you. So we do need that centralized.

15:06
Yeah. So I like this framework that you're showing here. My only =
question is that we don't really have a regional structure other than under=
 the legal entity work stream. Everything else is global. It's the =
functions that are driving it. So region is like, we don't have different =
applications in the region. So the only thing that would be regional would =
be a subset of the les, which there. I think, because we have that regional=
 structure already set up by country.

15:40
And.

15:40
You know, by entity, I would build that in there. But otherwise, I think =
you go level two to. Or level zero to level two.

15:48
Two.

15:51
It's to sort of pick up things that come up immediately. Right. So =
something happens in apac. The APAC regional team will be kind of on point =
first and then by the time US wakes up, they're able to sort of spend some =
time on it.

16:06
So it's really, they're triaging, but it's more not by =
region, it's by time zone.

16:12
It's the fall of the sun.

16:13
It's a fall of the sun. Right. So okay, so it's not that we're expecting, =
you know, it's. It's that. Okay, got it.

16:20
But, but they do have that =
structure, right? So there is a regional lead and there is country leads. =
Right? So like there, there is something we can leverage that exists.

16:28
So, so is the regional lead and country leader. Is that a Honeywell =
person? Is that an EY person? Is that already in our plan? Is that =
something new that we need to build? How do I think about who's the money =
button?

16:40
I would think of them as the current LES resources. So Olga =
for EMEA and things like that.

16:48
Yeah, but are they going to do the, =
you know, all of the things in the region, including sop, you know, sopo, =
including it, including uat.

17:04
I would consider them as like a =
coordinator. Right. Like they're sort of the, they're that cross functional=
 person that coordinates with regional IT or regional trade compliance, for=
 example, or the regional functional teams.

17:22
So Piers, we'll have to =
think about it from an IT perspective in the app landscape. A lot of these =
are global, but there are some site specific or region specific apps, again=
 more of an exception rather than the rule. But again we'll see from an IT =
perspective, we'll have to see if, if something like that is needed or if =
it's an overkill. But again it has to be follow the sun. We'll just have to=
 see, you know, how that, that triage. If the triaging process and that =
escalation process is, is set up well then it's it, you know, it's, the =
process will work. It's just who's the coordinator that, that feeds IT in =
and triages per the guiding principles.

18:03
It gets to Benny Peers =
because Benny is an apac. We just think about who are the individuals as we=
 move IT around. But I do think it needs to be IT specific because having =
someone as a business leader, while important, they can move something from=
 here to here, but they can't really look at it, prioritize it, understand =
would need to Be someone that's it in nature. And so I like the format. I =
just think that we just, if we can just put an IT spin on it, it'll be a =
little bit more effective for us.

18:34
Let's just, let's put it two in =
the box. So if we want to do a follow the sun and we're going to have a =
regional, you know, report out, then they should have a war room and they =
should be looking at what's coming in there and they should give us a pulse=
 check on this is what we're seeing in, you know, apac and that should flow=
 into, you know, I, I assume like we'll have a 7, 8am or 8am hypercare call=
 and it'll be, here's the report out from apac. We've got this, you know, =
has come in, this has come out. This is the top three or four issues. Then =
we'll, we'll come in at lunch and it'll be, this is emia, this is what's =
going on in emea. Then we'll have a connect at the end of the day and it's =
like, hey, this is what's going on in the Americas. And this is what we're =
deploying as fixes to APAC overnight, you know, what we're expecting to see=
 there. And then it'll be rinse and repeat until we get into a stable =
environment. When is the first UAT that we're doing, when does it start?

19:40
June 20th, I believe in fact some systems UAT that are light touch =
are happening around June 13th. From the supply chain perspective. IT =
supply chains got some.

19:50
How many do we have going on right now?

19:53
We have. Oh, let me get that number to you. The last count of it was =
I think about 40 something. I will get you that exact number, Jeff.

20:04
So Rakesh, what I'd like to do is I want to start rolling the marble on =
this sooner rather than later. You know, we can use SIT to kind of run it =
through this. You won't have the regional flavor necessarily from sit, =
that's fine. But the framework of hey, here's the dashboard. We got these =
number of sits going that are going to turn into a uat. Here's the business=
 owner, here's the IT owner, here's where we are. The SIT is red, green, =
orange, red. Here's the defect burn down in the commentary. That piece of =
it, we could start practicing.

20:47
Absolutely. Yeah.

20:48
So why don't we just start practicing that next week because the hypercare =
stuff will be a little bit different. But it'll still follow that same =
framework and then we can get a flavor for what's it going to look like? =
Does it meet Sukai's and I's need? But even with that Sukai, like we're =
running 42 sits. You should be reporting out on how the sits are going to =
Sheila and to, you know, Scareco. Hey, you know, they don't even know we've=
 got 42 sit. That's a great sign of progress. Hey, we got 42 SIDS going. =
Here's the spectrum. We're collectively, you know, so putting that framing =
on it at least as a weekly update now and maybe daily as we get a little =
bit closer, I think would be a great communication for you to lead just, =
you know, in that space.

21:41
I agree, Sukha. Absolutely. We'll get you =
that. We've got about 20 plus in supply chain that, you know, based on the =
conversations over the last couple of days that they're starting sit. And =
then there's a few in ERP space. So that's ISE and erp.

21:58
Can we do that next Friday?

22:00
Yeah, let's put a next Friday on the =
calendar. Just every Friday. And then once we feel like we got it down to =
science and we don't need it, we can get rid of it.

22:07
So.

22:08
All right, Hannah can work on that.

22:11
Okay.

22:12
No, great.

22:12
Okay, good start. I think we're very much on the, you know, Sean, we're =
very much off to the same page on severity. That's great. It matches up =
exactly with the way I like to run these, these things. I think this is a =
good framework so we'll want to get it to a little simpler of a story for =
opsep. So let's, let's run roll the marble, you know, once or twice. But =
then before we get into OR in the BRB workshop on the 25th, I want to go =
through this is what hypercare is going to look like to start to socialize =
that.

22:50
Yeah, agreed. And as well you. One of the comments on that =
first page was that we need like the intake channels to, to be trained up =
with FAQs and things like that on how to manage known issues that are going=
 to come up. So a customer places the order with a wrong le. So all of that=
 like training and FAQ kind of has to happen in July so that they're ready =
for those known issues to pop up in August.

23:18
Okay, awesome.

23:22
All right, so lots of good action items takeaways here. Sukai, Jeff, we'll,=
 we'll come back, circle back. We'll work with PS2 for scheduling next =
Friday. And then we'll. We'll share what we. In terms of the dashboards and=
 rolling the marble for us.

23:37
Okay? Thanks, guys.

23:38
Thanks, everyone.

 Give me a second here. So again, I think a lot of these, you know, a few =
of these we have touched upon that you point out. I think we&#x27;ve added =
in the appendix Sukhai and Jeff, so we&#x27;ll certainly go through that. =
But again, I think this is just level setting. So to the points you made, =
kt, uat, go live readiness, Hypercare, really the series of activities =
happening there, I think where we are and what we&#x27;ve done after the =
kickoff is identify resources, you know, the roles, responsibilities. There=
 are some gaps in there. We have a tracker that we&#x27;re still refining =
that. Actually, frankly, we&#x27;re a bit behind because we said we would =
do that. We&#x27;d have all the names in from all the functions and it by =
523 and it&#x27;s, you know, a few days later, so we&#x27;re still chasing =
people for that. And I think that&#x27;s going to set up you peers to make =
sure that you have all the names and you&#x27;re successful here. But again=
 that&#x27;s something we&#x27;re tracking behind on. But again I think =
we&#x27;ve seen this view of yes, the teams are going through SIT right now=
, the IT teams, they&#x27;re developing all the test scripts for it. From =
what we heard, we&#x27;re setting up those connects between IT work streams=
 and the respective functions to align on what are the processes in play, =
what are the systems to be touched, what information flows through, =
what&#x27;s available. So that&#x27;s still work in progress over the next =
couple of weeks. But again this is how the sequence of events is planned =
for Obviously I think you and the PMO have the hiring plan tracking in =
place so that will tell us when seats are in the right roles and KT has =
happened or what the status of that is to support the UAT readiness. So =
again, all of these will be in that tracker, both in the BRB tracker as =
well as the UAT readiness tracker. That will support it. But again, I just =
want to lay that out and I think part of.</div></div><div =

6">Would like us to work backwards from the end in mind with me, myself and=
 Sukai as the customer. So let me tell you what I would want that to show. =
I would want to see the application, the uat, what the application is. I =
would want to see who the business UAT leader is, who the IT UAT leader is.=
 And then I would want to see the progression of the stages of that =
application testing for the things that you laid out in there. So it could =
just be a block almost of showing like you know, how much progression and =
some sort of a heat map on how it&#x27;s going to hey, we&#x27;re in sit. =
Sit&#x27;s green, sit&#x27;s red, sit&#x27;s orange. And then on the =
forward ones for things that we&#x27;re not yet into, like if we&#x27;re =
going to say we&#x27;re doing sit, SAT sign off, then we&#x27;re going to =
uat. Then what is the projected start date for the uat? Right. Then I would=
 want to see a readout of the number of, you know, defects or issues or and=
 if we want to just call like anything a defect, a training defect, an IT =
defect, a data defect, they&#x27;re all defects, they&#x27;re all issue. We=
 don&#x27;t call it defect. We could say they&#x27;re issues.=

right, because there&#x27;s going to be weeks that we open more than we =

6">Yeah, yeah. So I think this could. I just, you know, we&#x27;re gonna. =
What, what we&#x27;re gonna. I mean, this is gonna be good at a high level,=
 but then we&#x27;re going to need to. Because all applications are not =
created equal. If this is HCM or this is ERP makes up 90% of this, then =
that&#x27;s going to be bad. If ERP and ACM are like 5% of this and =
it&#x27;s other, you know, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s Documentum or it&#x27;s =
Team center or it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s really impacting one =
function. It&#x27;s still important, but. But it&#x27;s not gonna be a =
threat to business continuity. Right. So what needs to come out of this is =
we need that triaging with your expertise, with data supporting it that =
we&#x27;re, Sukai and I are applying our focus in the areas that need our =
focus. Whether that&#x27;s chasing users to get their testing done or =
it&#x27;s, you know, making sure our leadership is aware that we have a =
major issue that could impact our ability, you know, or the quality of our =
go live because the HCM is running behind. You know, that&#x27;s what we =
need to be able to get, get out of this. And so if we could just see it. =
It&#x27;s helpful for me to understand, you know, the volume of testing =
that&#x27;s going on at any one time because, you know, it will help me =
think about how hard I press the functions on other things because I =
don&#x27;t want to like, give them a bunch of mandatory things to do right =
in the middle of a bunch of testing that they need to do on the IT things. =
And we might, you know, think about how we want to spread things out. Or I =
may go to, we may go to the functions in OPSEP and say, say commercial. =
You&#x27;ve got like 10 UAT&#x27;s next week. Do you have the capacity, do =
you have the people set aside for this. Right. It&#x27;s just there&#x27;s =
going to be a lot going on. The number of issues that have flown into my =
desk today is like record high for a Friday. So I can tell we&#x27;re, =
we&#x27;re getting close to the go live because of the number of thorny =
issues that are rolling in. And it&#x27;s only gonna. It&#x27;s only gonna =
get worse. Right? It&#x27;s gonna. And so we need a robust process for it.=

very linear. Right. Where the first thing that we have to look at is KT =
enables uat. In order to enable kt, we have to get the hiring and the =
receivers and the catchers, all that stuff. Right. So that left to right is=
 something that we have contemplated in the data model that we&#x27;ll have=
 reporting for. The other thing that I just wanted to comment on is around =
that you made a comment around the taxonomy of severity. Not only is that =
important for normalizing, you know, what&#x27;s critical to go live, but =
it&#x27;s also going to be in what we&#x27;re proposing here, part of the =
exit criteria of defining a successful completion of UAT to call it done. =
We don&#x27;t want it to be subjective. Right.</div></div><div =

It&#x27;s a. We can&#x27;t go live with it because of the severity of the. =
It&#x27;s a block. Right. High is again, I like the impact, but it&#x27;s =
that there is a workaround, but it&#x27;s a significant many work. So =
actually your definitions align perfectly with the way that I think about =
it. The user count is less, you know.</div></div><div =

 qualitative process. So my question will be, who is the single arbiter of =
the severity? Who&#x27;s going to audit that and how does it get set? So =
when someone reports a ticket, do they put in the severity? Because we =
train everybody and we give them this and they put in the severity. If =
that&#x27;s the process, which I&#x27;m fine with that process, =
someone&#x27;s going to need to go through those and say, nah, that&#x27;s =

is, you know, it comes in again, illustrative. But there is that, that =
vetting process up front based on FAQs, based on the training to understand=

 issue tracker where you can see kind of critical IT issues as well as =
critical business issues. Right. Like things like payroll isn&#x27;t =
functioning. Right. Or certain suppliers are not able to process orders or =
things like that. And I do think that a central team has to kind of own =
that issue list, and that&#x27;ll kind of be part of their role, is =
ensuring that criticality is appropriately tagged. Because even if you =
think about, like, on a weekly basis. Right. We want that full list, and =
we&#x27;d want, like, a curated summary of that list to sort of report back=
 to yourself, to report up, you know, to GREV or what have you. So we do =
need that centralized.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:=
