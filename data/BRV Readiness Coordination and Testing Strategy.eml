BRV Readiness Coordination and Testing Strategy

**Detailed Summary of =
Discussion (June 20th, 2025)**

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. BRV System Readiness and Collaboration

- Readiness for BRV =
(Business Readiness Verification) is on track.
- Emphasis on collaboration =
between ERP Finance, HR, and Integrated Supply Chain (ISC) systems.
- Robust testing is being prioritized for BRB (Business Readiness Baseline)=
 enablement.
- Discussion on including HR in the readiness plans and =
cleaning up the readiness documentation.
- Updating the list of key =
systems: ERP Finance, HR, ISC.

### 2. Process, People, Contract, and =
System Readiness

- Four focus areas: Process, People, Contract, System.
- Process:
    - On track but hypercare process needs finalization, =
staffing, and communication.
    - Gen and Pre assigned to prepare the =
hypercare process for an upcoming VRV readiness workshop.
    - Action: Homework needed with Paul; Rashid meeting planned to identify=
 leads for the command center.
- People:
    - Dashboard shows 70 hires =
targeted by July.
    - Clarification: Resource hiring is to expedite KT =
(Knowledge Transfer) and readiness for Day 1, not critical for PRB =
enablement.
    - Action: Capital Edge tracker for hiring needs updating; =
clarify that not all hires are critical to PRB.
    - Discussion on =
permissions to update the tracker and categorization (BRV, BRV-adjacent, =
etc.).

### 3. System & Trackers

- Request for updated slide/reporting =
from Annie Elliot with the latest figures (based on Excel as of June 19th, =
2025).
- Discussion on how to categorize and report systems: core, adjacent=
, and grand totals to be presented for workshop deck.
- For BRV, clarify whether to track core systems only or include all (e.g.,=
 7 core vs. 17 total).
- ISC currently lists 40 critical systems, which =
should be validated/upgraded for accuracy.

### 4. Testing/UAT Schedule and=
 Tracking

- UAT schedules to be finalized, MOS (Management Operating =
System) in place to track execution for BRB, not just readiness.
- Discussion on vacation/tester availability and how that risk is being =
addressed in the schedule.
- Action: Paul to update documentation after =
reviewing the PRP portion over the weekend (by June 22nd, 2025).
- Need to align ISC=E2=80=99s number of critical systems with BRB and =
BRB-adjacent categorization.

### 5. Testers Analysis & Data Preparation

- Action Item: Lookup testers in scope ("in perimeter") vs. Athens list (3,=
500+ people), identifying overlap.
- Data to be broken down by function =
(supply chain, IT, business testers, etc.).
- Target to provide a pivoted =
analysis by end of day.
- For HCM (Human Capital Management), one testing =
script per country (26 countries =3D 26 scripts); add as a line item in =
dashboard reporting.

### 6. Hypercare and Reporting

- Jeff requires hypercare progress to be tracked and presented alongside =
regular test results.
- Suggestion to split hypercare reporting for TOSCA =
(automation), Excel (manual/manual+semi-automated), and ADP (standalone HR)=
.
- ADP to report separately on the 10 countries tested, results, and =
follow-ups.
- Plan to add UAT method (manual, semi-automated, automated) as=
 a column in the tracker.
- Discussion around the split between functional =
and end-to-end process testing, particularly for finance and supply chain.

### 7. Upcoming Deliverables and Calendar

- Preparation for next =
week=E2=80=99s (week of June 23rd, 2025) session on key deliverables.
- Commitments:
    - Detailed hour-by-hour calendar for execution.
    - Communication plans.
    - Daily synchronization meetings.
    - Deliverables associated with the above to be ready.
- Noted difficulty in establishing a fixed schedule due to dependencies and=
 defect rates=E2=80=94plan to build in buffer time and iterate based on =
test outcomes.

The conversation demonstrates=
 high coordination across functions, careful attention to reporting =
accuracy and readiness, and ongoing adjustments to testing and staffing =
plans in preparation for BRB enablement. Key deliverables and process =
checkpoints are in focus for review and updates before the next =
week=E2=80=99s session.

Transcript:
0:00
For BRV system readiness is on =
track with strong collaboration plan between ERP Finance and integrated =
supply chain systems to ensure robust testing for BRB enablement. Those are=
 the three I've put in. If you feel we put something more generic, we can =
also do that. But I think these are the key systems. Right?

0:17
Yeah. And we'll, we should also call HR as well. But, but yes, I'll, I'll. =
I'll take a pass at cleaning that up as well.

0:25
I'm going to add that ERP Finance, HR and integrated supply chain. Okay. =
Second one is then process people contract system. That was the four =
buckets that they talked about process. The comment Paul made was it's on =
track with the caveat that hypercare process to be finalized, staffed up =
and communicated. That's something we need to go go into and we. So Gen and=
 Pre will be team up the hypercare process in briefly in the VRV readiness =
workshop there is some homework that I need to do with Paul in the back end=
. So that's why I want to do the Rashid meeting so that we've got the leads=
 identified and what it will specifically do in that command center.

1:12
So I've got the leads for you from Paul. So when we do. Yes, Doug so Scott =
to help.

1:23
Okay.

1:23
So Scott works for Steve Delat so he's going to =
be pulled into supporting this. Okay so. But Doug is good. I've worked with=
 him before.

1:35
Yeah.

1:35
So he's my.

1:37
From what I remember he =
was a very friendly dude.

1:40
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No he's, he's. He does M =
A. He was part of the M A team until now. But no, as it relates to us, I =
think Doug is going to be that person that's going to be the front face to =
Jeff. So we essentially need not for this call but let's talk when we speak=
 with Rashid about what Aaron has as materials etc.

2:03
Yes, indeed. People are on track with people. The comment that we need to =
make pre brought it up and then Paul also wants to highlight it is that =
while we're fast tracking resourcing and those resource like BRV readiness =
people dashboard is showing 70 people to be hired for it. The point to make=
 is resource hiring is not critical for PRV enablement but it is being done=
 to expedite KT and catcher readiness for D1. So it's a bit of a mismatch =
because the PRV readiness Capital Edge dashboard if you've seen talks about=
 like 70 people being available for or by July and so need to clear up that=
 none of those are, like, critical to PRB enablement.

2:49
Right. So a couple of points there. Home housekeeping. I think that that =
Capital Edge tracker needs to be updated again, because I think this is the=
 part where Mac. I think at some point when I went in there, I couldn't do =
it because I don't think I had the permission to change it, even though I =
thought I should. But this is what we said is brv, non BRV and BRV adjacent=
.

3:13
Yeah.

3:14
So, yeah, we should put it as BRV and everything, =
perhaps, as you know. But let's talk about that Mac. But yes, I think very =
quickly that particular dashboard on that system tracker on Capital Edge =
needs an update. And I don't know if Brian.

3:30
Yes, the system's there =
and he actually created a. A slide version of this. And I pinged her a few =
minutes ago and I asked for it.

3:39
Who?

3:41
Annie. Annie Elliot had =
created a slide version of this and I pinged her a few minutes ago before =
we got on and asked for an updated copy.

3:52
Okay.

3:53
And it's based on our live Excel. Well, I guess the one from yesterday, but=
 it will have the right counts.

3:58
Okay. We just need to think through =
that because for it, it's one deal, but for other functions, we need to =
talk through that because the point being it's not just a filtering. So, =
for example, again, not to take on this call, but say even in finance, if =
they filter, they're going to get seven systems that are core and probably =
another 10 more that are non core. So for BRV, the question is, do they =
track the seven or they attack the 17? Perhaps the answer is seven, which =
means it's just that, you know, critical. Maybe it's. It's more than. Maybe=
 it's BRB and adjacent. So we just need to talk through that.

4:38
I. Yeah. So I had a conversation with Annie and Pre yesterday and they =
broke it out in brv, BRB adjacent and grand total, and said they would put =
grand totals, the grand total numbers, into the workshop deck view. But =
they have a breakdown as well.

4:54
Perfect. That's all that.

4:58
Okay, so on track systems, on track times. Mac, I need to drop in one and a=
 half minutes.

5:05
Sorry.

5:06
But on track and UAT schedules to be =
finalized and are finalized and MOS in place to track execution for brb. =
Right.

5:13
That's the.

5:13
That's the comment.

5:15
Actually track execution for brv, not just readiness or brb. Yeah, yeah, =
yeah.

5:22
Okay. So that is fine. Risk is something that Bill has brought =
up. I've put that in here. Vacations tested, availability due to vacations =
I know that you guys will address this through the MOS for UAT anyway, but =
I mean, this is the only one that's kind of come up as a request for E.R.B.=
 iT wise. Okay, systems. Then it's the double click into it. We've met with=
 the folks, they've kind of given the commentary. Paul has an action to =
kind of go do read the PRP portion over the weekend and make updates. But =
he, he kind of understands what's going on. The one that I'm not =
comfortable with is the ERP and finance piece. I think we need to reword it=
 because there's like, it seems like a rant right now, like testing =
compressed one week.

6:08
Okay, yeah, no, no, no, that needs to change =
because that's all changed. Yeah, yeah. Okay, let me take a look. I looked =
at it, but I glossed over this. I didn't connect the dots here. So I will =
take a look at that as well and change it.

6:20
So ERP, Finance and then =
even the ISC one, because in ISC they've set 40 critical systems identified=
. So this should match with your BRB plus BRB adjacent number. Right. Like =
40 seems a bit of an arbitrary number.

6:35
Not for. Not for day one, not =
for brb.

6:38
Yeah. So let's just align on what we need to get put here =
for like in terms of actual numbers now that we have them from these teams =
we should update. So those are the three comments that I think we should =
make. Update that file. Send that to Paul so that he. What he reads is. Is =
more up to date.

6:54
Okay, well, Prajan, can you send me this offline =
copy then? Because Paul is. He's in it right now making changes or he has =
it open. So.

7:04
Okay, I think he has it open, but like. Yeah, he won't.

7:07
You think it's.

7:09
Yeah, yeah, he was going to work on it over the =
weekend. Okay. Yes. Still, we should have it.

7:14
Can I send this to you in the next 30 minutes?

7:15
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7:18
All right, thanks man.

7:19
Cool. Okay. Hey, I know Prashant's going on to the onboarding. Mac.

7:24
Yeah.

7:24
So a couple of action items from the Jeff call which I thought =
compared to last week was like night and day, but again, a bit of work to =
do there. The couple of points that he mentioned that he wants the number =
of testers in the perimeter. What I need you help with is do a lookup. I =
think it's a fairly simple lookup. I'm getting a list of all of the people =
in the perimeter from Paul. Again, it's A private list. What he wants us to=
 do and what I think, what I, what I think we need to do is just look that =
up against all of the testers. And if you've got your 98 unique testers, =
look, look at that against the 3500 list of the Athens people in perimeter =
and see which ones are part of Athens.

8:19
Athens folks are not. Okay.

8:21
It's a fairly simple straight lookup. And a pivot.

8:24
Yeah.

8:25
That maybe, maybe we even do that by function. Maybe we give a table that =
says function, you know, sub function and then like supply chain, you know,=
 business tester. Is this. Yeah, IT tester. You would think all of the IT =
testers are all there. But look at the business names first, of course.

8:46
Yeah. I'll check it against the list and I'll get the raw count and =
then we can pull the function up from there. I mean, eventually, like as we=
 consolidate the test data too, we could get down to the scenario tracker =
that you were.

9:03
A 20 or 21 or the 34.

9:05
Yeah.

9:05
Or the 20.

9:06
20, 20.

9:08
Yeah.

9:09
Because those, those are the scenarios that =
those guys are going to run. And I think. Yeah, for the most part for the =
adjacent. There's 14. Yeah. Actually all 34 we should be tracking. Okay. So=
 that's one. And I think if we can get that pivot, we'll get back to him. =
Perhaps end of the day, the apps plus the hcm, the boarding, the, the =
dashboarding. He wanted to track HCM in one single place. I think we should=
 just add a line item there similar to ERP finance. Do HCM and we should =
say script is one per country and do 26. This is where we need to get our =
support or insight, I think it's. If we want to call it. There's a testing =
per country and you've got 26 countries. We run 26 reports or 26 scripts.

9:59
Yeah, I, I think so.

10:01
Just do that as a line item.

10:03
Yeah, 20, 26 line items.

10:06
No, one line item that says number of =
scripts. 26.

10:10
Okay. Okay.

10:13
So at least that would be in slide. =
Which slide is that? That's got the, the dashboard reporting slide. Ten or =
nine or whatever it was.

10:20
Nine. Yeah, yeah.

10:22
And then obviously the hypercare slide, we've got to split that up against.=
 We've got to talk a bit about how we want to split that up. So clearly he =
wants different hypercare and some of it makes, I think from that angle, I =
see his point. It may be just that I get his. He doesn't want to compete. =
Apples and oranges. Maybe we give him a hypercare out of Tosca, maybe we =
give him Excel and then we give ADPs hypercare because that's fairly =
standoffish. So ADP can say the Iran scripts and test for 10 countries, =
nine of them pass. I'm chasing down Romania.

11:00
Yeah, okay, so that's to some degree. I think we could even start with the =
view because I was thinking about this during the call. Like we could start=
 with just the, just a combined view of. Let me share this one of my screen=
. Just like add a column that's like the UAT method. Like is this manual or=
 automated? And then what's the progress?

11:28
Where here?

11:29
Yeah, well, not here, but just like we just need to take this column and =
add UAT method to our tracker. Exactly. And I think that that would be, =
that would be a quick and dirty way to get that view because that was =
effectively the question he was asking.

11:46
Right.

11:46
He called Bill out and said for this one trading compliance, which in their=
 sheet it said manual. I changed it to semi automated because that's what =
Bill said. But he was like talk me through for trading compliance, is it so=
 semi automated or automated, how does it work?

12:01
Is this, is this your read only copy? Because in the main copy in their, in=
 their online version I've made some updates to Ed. All the counts, yeah, =
counts are off, but I think this is your offline copy. Yeah, okay. Yeah, =
just reference that. Yeah, but I, I get your point. Now the question is, I =
think in Tosca he mentioned that 26 out of the 51 scenarios are automated. =
And to your point, maybe we do that. Maybe we do. Yeah. So we could do. I'm=
 tracking you and I think that makes sense. So in slide on slide 9 we say =
automated, you know, method. Everything in finance is, you know, manual. =
Everything in our 26 out of the 51 would be automated. So say four out of =
the eight sub functions and for those four we provide the TOSCA reporting. =
But the thing is they're not necessarily end to end process related. So =
even for example, if he wants the way he was slicing it was functional =
processes, end to end processes and then hr. HR is fairly separate. We can =
get it the functional processes all of finance, you know, it will be manual=
 and a few supply chain manual they're not nicely split up. Where I can say=
 all of supply chain is this or all of finances is because some of the end =
to end finance processes are also manual.

13:29
Yeah.

13:29
So if he wants end to end versus functional, that's a bit of a challenge. =
We need to Think through.

13:35
Yeah, I think we can deliver functional =
fairly quickly. End to end will take more time and. And probably some =
conversations to I think fit those pieces together in the end to end view =
where we can start with functional. And then I think that is something that=
 we can deliver today. Like we can say, how is this tested?

14:04
Let's look at that. Maybe during the working session with her, I think for =
the. Sometime this afternoon we can talk through that.

14:10
Yeah, let me pull those in.

14:13
And then in the meantime, let me wait =
for Paul's email on. On this and send you the data that he sent.

14:20
The roster. The roster, yeah.

14:23
Did he send me? Did he send me? Did he=
 send me? Where did he send. Okay, he hasn't sent it to me yet. So as soon =
as I get that, we'll do perfect.

14:36
Okay. I'll keep a lookout and I'll =
start updating the dashboard. And then we also, at some point should talk =
about the next week, middle of next week session on key deliverables. Like =
what key deliverables are coming up. And then we'll use that session to =
develop more detailed plans. But we should start to think through what the =
key deliverables, at least in our domain, what we committed to.

15:07
On his notes, right on the call, we said we would have the detail hour by =
hour calendar, we'd have the comms plans, we'd have to set up the daily =
sync. But all of that means that these deliverables are associated with it.=
 Have to be ready as well.

15:25
Yeah, we got. I mean, the sinks went out =
the. I think it's gonna be the schedule that's the hard part because to =
Jessica's point, it is a little bit ambiguous once you get past a certain =
point on timing, if there's a defect or not. But I think that you can just =
assume like a middle case scenario and say just build in a little bit of =
buffer time and assume like a, I don't know, whatever an average defect =
rate is and build a calendar based on that timing and say this is our =
assumption. Because she said that was the blocker of what. When she was =
talking about building out the detailed hour by hour calendar, she said as =
you get in between some of these, it gets more complicated because if =
there's a defect, the timing gets extended and it has to go back through. =
So.

16:24
Right, right, right. So I don't. So that will absolutely change.=
 Even as thing, as Sukhai pointed out, the last minute.

16:32
Yeah.

16:32
So I think it's just a starting point. We all know that everybody knows it =
will change, but we start off with something and say, here's the daily plan=
.

16:43
Yeah.

16:43
And we just have to adjust to it.

16:45
Exactly.

16:46
Step seven, this one got delayed because the prior one failed or got =
delayed or whatever. So I think we have what we have. Knowing that =
dependencies can change and script timing can change and execution success =
can change. So that one should be okay with what she's developing as a =
starting point. And even during the execution, between week one and week =
two, they may change it based on learnings.

17:16
Yeah.

17:16
Okay, So I think let's. So whenever we get on with her, we'll see what we =
need to do. But then I'll send you. I'll have Paul send this file, and then=
 we can do the lookup there.

17:30
Okay. Sounds good. Also in the =
dashboard. Thank you. Thanks, bud.

17:34
Thank you.

you know, manual. Everything in our 26 out of the 51 would be automated. So=
 say four out of the eight sub functions and for those four we provide the =
TOSCA reporting. But the thing is they&#x27;re not necessarily end to end =
process related. So even for example, if he wants the way he was slicing it=
 was functional processes, end to end processes and then hr. HR is fairly =
separate. We can get it the functional processes all of finance, you know, =

calendar based on that timing and say this is our assumption. Because she =
said that was the blocker of what. When she was talking about building out =
the detailed hour by hour calendar, she said as you get in between some of =
these, it gets more complicated because if there&#x27;s a defect, the =
timing gets extended and it has to go back through. So.</div></div><div =
