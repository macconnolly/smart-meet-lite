Application Mapping Challenges During System Transformation

The discussion centers on challenges and planning for application mapping =
during a major system transformation, focusing on identifying and =
classifying applications impacted by the BRV (Build-Readiness Validation) =
process, their User Acceptance Testing (UAT) status, and integration with =
the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). It also addresses =
complexities with cloned applications, legacy-to-new system transitions, =
and the need for more accurate functional mapping. The included images =
visually support these discussions with process and system disposition data=
.

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Application Identification & =
Classification Challenges
- Not all applications are yet in the CMDB, =
particularly for new or cloned apps.
- Some apps cannot be classified as =
strictly BRV (Build-Readiness Validation) or "Day One" apps; a third =
category may be necessary for apps going live outside main project =
milestones (e.g., July or June instead of October 27).
- When cloning applications, new app IDs may not yet be reflected in the =
CMDB=E2=80=94affecting mapping and tracking.

### 2. Impacted Applications =
& UAT Scope
- A provisional approach is needed for mapping and flagging =
applications that are being migrated, cloned, or are otherwise impacted but=
 not directly in scope for BRV or =E2=80=9CDay One.=E2=80=9D
- Suggestion to collaborate with business functions and IT to get accurate =
listings of the applications they are using and impacting.
- A two-step process is inferred:
    1. Validate which applications are =
truly BRV-related=E2=80=94a current list of 22 BRV apps is acknowledged as =
potentially inaccurate.
    2. Build a functional mapping view for UAT, =
identifying which apps or processes affect which functions, even if they =
aren=E2=80=99t strictly BRV.

### 3. Functional Mapping & Process =
Complexity
- Scenarios exist where business processes change, but the =
supporting systems do not (especially where Temporary Systems =
Architecture=E2=80=94TSA=E2=80=94is in use).
- There are applications (like=
 HR/payroll) where parts of the process have migrated (e.g., to Oracle HCM)=
, but legacy systems (like PeopleSoft and ADP) are still in use for certain=
 functions or regions.

### 4. Example: HR System Transformation
- Oracle HCM went live May 12, 2025, but operational issues mean some =
regions (e.g., US) still process payroll via PeopleSoft, while others use a=
 new Honeywell HCM.
- The process adds complexity to UAT and mapping since =
both legacy and new systems are used concurrently, and different legal =
entities may be involved.

---

## Action Items / Suggested Steps

1. **Obtain Accurate BRV App List:** Engage with business functions and IT =
to confirm which applications are touched by BRV=E2=80=94current list (22 =
apps) may not be accurate.
2. **Document Impacted Applications:** Create =
documentation based on feedback detailing all apps being touched/migrated, =
with clear distinctions (BRV, Day One, third category).
3. **Improve Functional Mapping for UAT:** Build or refine the matrix that =
maps application impacts to business functions, including process and =
system disposition status.
4. **Address Cloning and Legacy System Issues:**=
 Develop a provisional process for handling cloned apps or systems without =
a formal new CMDB entry.

---

## Images

### Image 1: Process & System =
Disposition Spreadsheet
- Shows the breakdown of build-back vs. move-as-is =
processes across functions (CCEX, Finance, HR, ISC, Legal, etc).
    - Example: CCEX has 77 build-back and 257 move-as-is processes (334 =
total).
    - System disposition columns show how many require SIT/UAT, TSA=
 validation, etc.
- Some numbers are marked "TBC" (To Be Confirmed) or =
"N/A" (Not Applicable), indicating areas requiring further data.
- **Significance:** This spreadsheet is essential for tracking scope and =
readiness for system/process changes, supporting project management for =
rollouts.

### Image 2: Functional Mapping for UAT Spreadsheet
- Matrix mapping software/systems (rows) to business functions/departments =
(columns: IT, Finance, HR, ISC, etc.), with "X" marks for involvement.
    - Example: "GLOBAL COMPENSATION 1.0 PROD" involves IT, HR, and Finance.
- Multiple tabs suggest comprehensive documentation (BRV Apps, Non-BRV Apps=
, etc.).
- **Significance:** Helps identify which applications need to be =
considered for UAT by function, clarifying ownership and impact zones.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Timeframes & Dates:**
    - Some apps go live in =
July or June 2025, not the main project date of October 27, 2025.
    - Oracle HCM went live May 12, 2025.
- Provisional approaches and =
iterative, collaborative documentation are recommended due to incomplete =
data (missing CMDB entries, in-progress migrations).
- Complex business process and system interdependencies (especially in =
HR/payroll) highlight the importance of detailed mapping and validation =
before UAT.

I don't think is in CMDB yet. So the fact is =
though, that will go to UAT and we may need to understand maybe we, you =
know. So here's my logic. The flag right now the options are BRV and day =
one, we have this case in it where it's neither. So there's a third option =
where it's not purely a BRV, but it's in that time frame. So BRB, if you =
translate it as August 1st, then we have some apps going around there that =
is in that time frame. Now, is it day one related? No, they're not going =
live October 27, they're going live in July and June. So we need to make a =
provision for that. The second part of this is there isn't, you know, an =
app, something like a build back, which is a clone. You're not going to =
have the new application ID from CMDB because it's either not created or if=
 it is, it hasn't been imported into the 296. The 296 reflects the original=
 Honeywell app landscape. So if I'm cloning an app, the app that's getting =
cloned, the clone is the one that's getting touched in uat. But we have to =
reflect it somehow here. So we may have to call the original app as a BRV =
or we may have to flag the original Honeywell app as the one being touched =
because we don't have another way of flagging the new app. So those are the=
 kind of tips and tricks we need to go through to look at and say, I've got=
 this 296. Now maybe this is a conversation we have with the functions and =
the it to say, say what is it you're touching? Give me a list of all the =
apps you touch and let's document them. And then we come in here and we say=
, and this is where provision is needed. So here's the layering in.

2:05
Yeah, I think that's exactly what we need is like this. These were the 22 =
for BRV. And once we, I think step one is validate the apps that are BRV. =
Like for example, you said that there were HR that we might have that are =
actually not like these hr. Maybe not. So we don't have the right list of =
22 BRV apps. So that's step one, go out and get input on what are the BRV =
apps. And then step two is a view like this, the functional mapping for UAT=
 where they can tell us it might not be a BRV app, but it goes and touches =
all of these functions. Right?

2:47
Correct. Now that's from a business =
process perspective. So the process may be changing, but the system may be =
on a tsa, for example. Right. So if the process is changing but the =
system's on a tsa, do I call it a VRV app? You know, because it's a TSA on =
day one. But if I'm doing a new process on the same system or if it's a new=
 move as is process, but a new person's doing it, there's some BRV impact =
because it's touching a system. They may have to go into the system and =
verify something. And so we can say it's impacted by prv, but it's not a =
system that's changing at brv. So we have to. I didn't realize scenarios =
like that.

3:35
Can't see my actual screen. I've been. Let me just share =
the whole thing.

3:39
I've been showing the other one, but okay, yep, yep,=
 yep. I've seen these.

3:43
Yeah. Okay, so it's like this one. These are =
the 22 that are wrong.

3:48
Right.

3:48
And then functional mapping.

3:50
Most technically, 90% of them are right. But yeah, a few of them are.

3:55
Not like those HR ones.

3:57
Correct. So these HR we added in, for =
example, this Honeywell 8, Oracle HCM is a brand new app that's coming up, =
but there's an impact. So think of it this way. Today they have PeopleSoft =
in Honeywell and they're transforming that PeopleSoft and going with Oracle=
 HCM. So today in the CMDB, they're generating a new app number for the new=
 Honeywell HCM that is going live. In fact, it went live last May 12, a =
couple of weeks ago. So it went live. They have some issues with it. =
They're using both Systems now on 8. 1. If you talk to Arpit on our HR team=
, they'll tell you that people are getting paid out of, you know, the, the =
people are moving to the right legal entity in Honeywell HCM. So there's =
some work needed for PRV. And then people in the US are getting paid out of=
 the PeopleSoft payroll. So the old HCM system is being used for payroll, =
for payroll processing for us. They're using ADP as an outsourced provider =
to provide payroll for rest.

is in CMDB yet. So the fact is though, that will go to UAT and we may need =
to understand maybe we, you know. So here&#x27;s my logic. The flag right =
now the options are BRV and day one, we have this case in it where =
it&#x27;s neither. So there&#x27;s a third option where it&#x27;s not =
purely a BRV, but it&#x27;s in that time frame. So BRB, if you translate it=
 as August 1st, then we have some apps going around there that is in that =
time frame. Now, is it day one related? No, they&#x27;re not going live =
October 27, they&#x27;re going live in July and June. So we need to make a =
provision for that. The second part of this is there isn&#x27;t, you know, =
an app, something like a build back, which is a clone. You&#x27;re not =
going to have the new application ID from CMDB because it&#x27;s either not=
 created or if it is, it hasn&#x27;t been imported into the 296. The 296 =
reflects the original Honeywell app landscape. So if I&#x27;m cloning an =
app, the app that&#x27;s getting cloned, the clone is the one that&#x27;s =
getting touched in uat. But we have to reflect it somehow here. So we may =
have to call the original app as a BRV or we may have to flag the original =
Honeywell app as the one being touched because we don&#x27;t have another =
way of flagging the new app. So those are the kind of tips and tricks we =
need to go through to look at and say, I&#x27;ve got this 296. Now maybe =
this is a conversation we have with the functions and the it to say, say =
what is it you&#x27;re touching? Give me a list of all the apps you touch =
and let&#x27;s document them. And then we come in here and we say, and this=
 is where provision is needed. So here&#x27;s the layering in.=

not like these hr. Maybe not. So we don&#x27;t have the right list of 22 =
BRV apps. So that&#x27;s step one, go out and get input on what are the BRV=
 apps. And then step two is a view like this, the functional mapping for =
UAT where they can tell us it might not be a BRV app, but it goes and =

these HR we added in, for example, this Honeywell 8, Oracle HCM is a brand =

this way. Today they have PeopleSoft in Honeywell and they&#x27;re =
transforming that PeopleSoft and going with Oracle HCM. So today in the =
CMDB, they&#x27;re generating a new app number for the new Honeywell HCM =
that is going live. In fact, it went live last May 12, a couple of weeks =
ago. So it went live. They have some issues with it. They&#x27;re using =
both Systems now on 8. 1. If you talk to Arpit on our HR team, they&#x27;ll=
 tell you that people are getting paid out of, you know, the, the people =
are moving to the right legal entity in Honeywell HCM. So there&#x27;s some=
 work needed for PRV. And then people in the US are getting paid out of the=
 PeopleSoft payroll. So the old HCM system is being used for payroll, for =
payroll processing for us. They&#x27;re using ADP as an outsourced provider=
