=F0=9F=93=9DSummary
Main Topics Discussed1. Regional Readiness and Coordination Challenges

   - There are concerns regarding varying levels of readiness between sites
   (US vs. China) for User Acceptance Testing (UAT), which is scheduled to
   begin in 9 days.
   - The lack of clear coordination and site-level preparation was
   highlighted, specifically needing someone to manage and communicate
   directly with individuals like Bill at the plant level to clarify which
   systems are changing and what needs testing.
   - Sriram (business side) and either Gary Hamby or Steve Delat (IT side)
   were suggested as key coordinators, though neither were present on the
   call. Assigning responsibility to coordinate with each site was identifi=
ed
   as a key action item.

2. Systems Inventory, Reporting, and BI Integration

   - Emphasis on publishing the system inventory dashboard and ensuring
   reporting is available, moving from Capital Edge to Smartsheets or anoth=
er
   platform.
   - The BI layer currently operates on Capital Edge. There=E2=80=99s a nee=
d to
   communicate all requirements to the BI team and share the model for the
   systems tracker to enable further development.
   - Action needed to send the necessary model to the BI developer,
   allowing work to commence (estimated at 50 hours, approximately one week=
).

3. Action Items and Meeting Summary

   - Number of action items identified, including the need for a summary of
   this meeting=E2=80=99s decisions and deliverables.
   - Use of Copilot and inclusion of Loop components/tables for summarizing
   notes, tracking key decisions by team, assignment updates, systems
   clarifications, and next steps.
   - Urgency to finalize meeting notes and actions for distribution by
   2:00pm Eastern Time (current time noted as 11:00am Eastern).

4. Preparation for Upcoming Meetings

   - Similar coordination and documentation efforts needed for meetings
   with finance (June 11, 2025), HR (June 12, 2025), and other business
   functions.
   - Need to update and prepare a table showing all systems in scope,
   specifically tailored for finance for the next day's session.
   - Ensuring the finance table mirrors the format of the current view,
   with some columns to be populated during/after the meeting.

5. Sharing Documentation and Access Considerations

   - Discussion on potential access issues for non-IT staff to certain
   links or system scope resources=E2=80=94decision required on how to shar=
e these
   materials broadly.

Action Items

   1. *Coordinate Site Readiness:*
      - Assign responsibility for site-level communication and
      coordination, especially with plant representatives.
      - Sriram (business) and Gary Hamby or Steve Delat (IT) to be involved=
.
   2. *Systems Inventory Reporting:*
      - Send the BI model/system tracker to the BI developer today;
      estimated development time: 50 hours (about 1 week).
      - Publish or transition the system inventory report/dashboard to
      Smartsheets or a suitable platform.
   3. *Meeting Summaries and Follow-up:*
      - Summarize key decisions and next steps using Loop/component tables
      grouped by team and assignment.
      - Prepare a meeting summary in the next 1.5 hours for internal
      review, with a target to send final notes and links by 2:00pm
Eastern (June
      10, 2025).
      - Review and edit summarized notes before distributing to all teams.
   4. *Preparation for Next Meetings:*
      - Develop and deliver a table of finance systems in scope for the
      Finance meeting on June 11, 2025.
      - Ensure columns for UAT business lead and other details can be
      populated post-meeting.
   5. *Documentation Access:*
      - Evaluate options to make system scope documentation accessible to
      non-IT team members.

Follow-Ups / Next Steps

   - Finalize and review meeting summary and action items by 12:30pm-1:00pm
   Eastern for distribution before 2:00pm.
   - Continue to refine documentation, Loop tables, and action registers
   across teams.
   - Review access protocols and determine best method for sharing system
   scope materials with all stakeholders.
   - Prepare for finance session content and review requirements for HR
   meeting later in the week.

Timeline & Key Dates

   - *June 10, 2025:* Meeting discussed above; distribute notes by 2:00pm
   Eastern.
   - *June 11, 2025:* Finance meeting=E2=80=94provide systems in scope tabl=

Cash0:00
Regionally, I'm going to touch across centrally. I'm going to, you know,
only do go to one site. You know, is it here? You saw the US site pipe up,
but you know, that could be China may have a different story and the China
site may think differently. So that's my big concerns like that I think are
what's now is an issue for me in that this is not, you know, they're not as
ready as they think they should be. No, I mean they're nine days from UAT
and there's not much here.
Unknown0:34
Yeah. So like bringing that down to a tactical level, I think that there's
a couple things. But I think my main, the main thing that I have a question
about is who is going to do that coordination like to that guy Bill from
that site, who is going to manage down to that, to that person and say,
hey, these are all of the systems that are involved at your plant. These
are the ones that are changing. This is what you need to test.
Cash0:59
So it's a bit of Sriram on the business side and then perhaps Gary Hamby or
Steve Delat on our IT side. I know neither of those were on the call today,
but it's probably an action item we need to take to coordinate, to
coordinate those conversations or at least highlight it as an action item
that they need to talk to particular sites about what will need to get
changed. So. But yeah, I mean certainly there are, you know, lots of
coordination needed here. Like work is still going on when they're supposed
to have stopped, you know, all this other stuff. So I mean, meeting itself
was good. I think it just opened up a lot of can of worms in terms of what
needs to happen. Yeah.
Unknown1:52
Is there anything that jumped out at you like from our, like from our side
where, where we might support.
Cash2:00
Well, support from this is really coordination and connecting the dots. I
think the broader thing now is on the one hand we should get our system
inventory dashboard and everything sorted out and published so that the
whole thing on Capital Edge and getting that report published not in
Capital Edge but in Smartsheets or wherever we're thinking of and running a
bi. We need to get that done. Remind me again, the BI stuff was on top of
Capital Edge, correct?
Unknown2:32
Yeah, it's on top of Capital Edge.
Cash2:34
Okay, so did we send that requirement to those guys?
Unknown2:38
No, I think we have the model now. So that was kind of that systems
tracker. Like we have our model now and he can go model on top of it.
Cash2:45
Okay, can you send that to him today? So it'll take him through 50 hours to
do that, but that may be a week. So then, yeah, at least let them go. That
needs to happen in parallel. Let them go do that. So that's an action item
on this call. There are quite a few action items. So if you can use Copilot
to summarize. I jotted down a few things, but I'm going to keep the call
open anyway for a few an hour or so. But if you want to help summarize the
this thing, let's review that afterwards because before we send notes to
everyone, I want to review, review the action items and see if, you know,
obviously Copilot's gonna get more than what I missed. So let's at least
look at that and action this because today is this finance. We'll go
through a similar exercise tomorrow and HR and Thursday.
Unknown3:41
Yeah.
Cash3:41
So I want us to be prepared content wise. It may or may not change. So
slide two where you have systems in scope. I need the, the finance systems
as well. Right. So tomorrow we'll have a conversation with finance, but I
need that table for finance.
Unknown3:58
Yeah, we need the same view table. Yeah, that's that same view. It's not
gonna, we're gonna, the column on like the UAT business lead is going to be
blank and some of the details that all of those folks filled in over the
last day. But I think that that will be the action for the finance folks is
to go in and populate that wherever possible.
Cash4:18
Yeah. All right, so do that. Let's reach back. I want to send the notes in
by let's say in three hours time. So what is it now, 11 Eastern. So I want
to send it by 2, by around, you know, 2pm or earlier than 2pm Eastern. So
please give me, let's discuss sometime in a little bit later, maybe in an
hour and a half the notes and action items, etcetera, along with the links
we need to send people. It's likely some of these non IT guys will not have
access to the links to this site to the system Scope link. So let's see
what we want to do about that. But yeah, if you can summarize this. So
three action items for you. One, connect with the Capital Edge guy and send
him that stuff. So that's out of our hair. Two, summarize these notes. I'll
leave the copilot on or at least I'll leave the meeting on. So summarize
the notes, let's review that and then three, have the chart for the finance
side for tomorrow.
Unknown5:31
Yeah, Sounds great. I just sent you the loop component with a couple
tables. So I had it break it down by key decisions overall and then by
team. So like the ISC business team, work stream teams, site manufacturing
teams, then overall systems clarifications, these workstream assignment
updates. And then if you go to the bottom, it's like next step and follow
up meetings. So the follow ups that are required, the meetings and who I
got down that were going to be on them and then this is what our timeline
will look like and then for us, like our team.
Cash6:06
Perfect. This is good.
Unknown6:08
Yeah. So I'll continue to refine this and build in a little bit more, get
those other things built and then we can follow up when you're done with
the costing stuff.
Cash6:16
Okay. And for this one, what did you type into copilot just give you
summary or just meeting? Summary.
Unknown6:24
Well, I asked it to, I said this was our functional, I gave it context.
Then I said generate nuance, crisp meeting, follow up email use tables,
group things, strategically delineate between things on the client, the
various client teams. And that's for us.
Cash6:38
Okay. All right, cool. All right. Yeah, no, this is good. Let me review
this and then by 2 o' clock we can review this further and send it out to
the teams. Sounds great as well. Actually, you know what, we may just be
able to put this on copilot there as well.
Unknown6:53
Yeah, exactly.
Cash6:54
But yeah, yeah, so let me do that. Okay. All right.
Unknown6:57
Okay, sounds good. Thanks for cash.
Cash6:58
All right, thank you.
Unknown6:59
Thanks.
Cash6:59
Bye. All right, talk later.

then perhaps Gary Hamby or Steve Delat on our IT side. I know neither of th=
ose were on the call today, but it&#39;s probably an action item we need to=
 take to coordinate, to coordinate those conversations or at least highligh=
t it as an action item that they need to talk to particular sites about wha=
t will need to get changed. So. But yeah, I mean certainly there are, you k=
now, lots of coordination needed here. Like work is still going on when the=
y&#39;re supposed to have stopped, you know, all this other stuff. So I mea=

 in terms of what needs to happen. Yeah.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bo=
