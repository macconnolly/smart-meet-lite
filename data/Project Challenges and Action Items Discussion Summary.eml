Project Challenges and Action Items Discussion Summary

## Project Discussion Summary

### Overview
The team is discussing the =
progress and challenges related to application transfer and costing within =
the project. Key topics include formulating arguments, handling standalone =
applications, coordinating with Colin Gillis, managing risks, and ensuring =
timely communication and action items.

### Main Topics Discussed

#### 1. **Formulating Arguments**
- **Step 1:** Define the core argument =
for the project.
- **Step 2:** Address the claim that certain applications =
were previously unseen, emphasizing that awareness existed for almost a =
year.
- **Step 3:** Develop a rough standalone costing for the applications=
 to avoid confusion and ensure clarity.

#### 2. **Standalone Costing and =
Application Review**
- Discussion on creating standalone cost estimates for=
 engineering applications.
- Mention of past experiences with standalone =
costing in smaller telecom deals.
- Emphasis on reviewing standalone =
components and assessing direct payments.
- Example: Allocating costs based=
 on location (e.g., Team Center France and Italy) to reflect in the =
business unit's profit and loss.

#### 3. **Coordination with Colin =
Gillis**
- **Risks Identified:** Colin Gillis's location affects the =
billing allocation model.
- **Action Items:**
  - Follow up with Colin to =
obtain detailed cost breakdowns for applications.
  - Schedule a call on =
Tuesday at 3:30 PM with Colin to address outstanding issues.
  - Ensure communication includes all relevant parties, such as Tori for =
Rockford-related contacts.
 =20
#### 4. **Risk Management and Landing Zone =
Issues**
- **Primary Risk:** Lack of a landing zone for business-managed =
applications, leading to potential delays and data placement issues.
- **Potential Consequences:** Delays in copying applications, inability to =
retain intellectual property (IP), and challenges in infrastructure =
procurement.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Raise concerns in the EI =
Cyber call.
  - Clearly communicate risks to stakeholders and seek =
appropriate responses.
  - Propose proactive communication to contract =
teams about delays and revised forecasts.

#### 5. **Communication and =
Follow-Up Actions**
- **Internal Communication:** Develop a compelling =
internal story to present to DT and other teams by end of day Monday.
- **External Communication:** Draft and send a note to the contracts team =
highlighting overdue tasks and revised timelines.
- **Resource =
Allocation:** Utilize the new resource in Rockford to obtain purchase =
orders and track additional contracts.

### Action Items

1. **By End of Day Monday:**
   - Develop an internal narrative for DT.
  =20
2. **Monday:**
   - Follow up with Colin Gillis to request detailed =
application costing information.
   - Schedule and prepare for the call =
with Colin on Tuesday at 3:30 PM.
  =20
3. **Tuesday:**
   - Participate in the call with Colin Gillis to address outstanding =
costing and application details.
  =20
4. **Ongoing:**
   - Work with Tori to engage Rockford contacts.
   - Coordinate with =
Stevie=E2=80=99s team to identify super users and procure necessary =
infrastructure.
   - Respond to Dean with a softened message assuring =
support while addressing current tasks.
   - Draft and send a proactive =
communication to the contracts team regarding delays and risks.

### Follow-Ups

- **Coordination with Colin Gillis:**
  - Ensure timely response and detailed costing information.
  - Address any gaps in application costing across different locations.
 =20
- **Infrastructure Procurement:**
  - Schedule time with the Rockford =
resource to obtain necessary purchase orders.
  - Track down additional =
Rockford contracts and ensure integration with Claire=E2=80=99s team.
 =20
- **Communication with Contracts Team:**
  - Draft a clear and professional=
 update on project delays and risk assessments.
  - Highlight the need for =
timely support to mitigate risks associated with landing zone =
unavailability.

### Key Points and Figures

- **Budget Allocation:** =
Engineering licenses cost approximately $100 million, distributed based on =
location-specific allocation metrics.
- **Application Breakdown:**=20
  - 40% included in the standalone.
  - 30% included in the business unit's=
 profit and loss.
  - Remaining 30% to be addressed with additional costing=
 (e.g., $500k estimated).
- **Deadlines:**
  - **Monday:** Internal =
narrative ready and follow-ups initiated.
  - **Tuesday at 3:30 PM:** Call =
with Colin Gillis.
 =20
- **Resources:**
  - New resource available in =
Rockford to assist with purchase orders and contract tracking.
  - Collaboration with Tori to leverage contacts for Rockford-related tasks=
.

### Risks Identified

- **Colin Gillis's Data Handling:** Potential =
incomplete accounting of application costs outside his area.
- **Landing Zone Unavailability:** Delays in copying applications due to =
lack of infrastructure, risking project timelines.
- **Communication =
Gaps:** Delays in addressing overdue tasks could escalate risks and impact =
project outcomes.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Proactive =
Communication:** Clearly communicate delays and risks to stakeholders to =
manage expectations.
- **Resource Utilization:** Leverage new and existing =
resources to obtain necessary data and support.
- **Risk Documentation:** =
Document identified risks and mitigation actions for transparency and =
accountability.

Three million. Right. Like do we just use pet and pen? =
Like. So anyway, I haven't seen the standalone from Redwood because I =
wasn't around. So that's sort of. Step one is like what's our argument then=
? Step two is they're saying we haven't seen these apps before so then we =
need to bump it up and we've already done this, but we need to bump it up =
against what was shared. You remember when we first started, we had like =
six bombs to work against. One of them was the file that was shared on the =
data site. So they're going to say I never knew about this when really =
they've known about this for almost a year. So that's point number two. And=
 then point number three is, all right, everything being sort of forgotten.=
 What's like a rough standalone for the apps that we are saying you guys.

0:53
Are getting a rough standalone.

0:56
Cost this as well. I need to put=
 it in paper so it's not confusing for you.

0:59
Yeah, I'm. But so can you=
 dumb it down for me?

1:04
I mean I have to do it on paper. I can't do it =
verbally because it's like. Have you done standalone before? Okay.

1:14
I mean, yeah, I did standalone costing before but it was small. It was like=
 a really small telecom deal.

1:20
Yeah. Yeah. So this isn't. It's not =
going to be. It's going to be reviewing a standalone and then the other =
component to this, which is kind of where Tim's at, is look if they're =
direct paid already. So I guess I'll take a step back. The biggest risk is =
Colin Gillis's location because that is used like they bill allocation =
model. And so what that means is let's just say the all engineering =
licenses cost 100 million. Everyone gets a peanut butter spread based on an=
 allocation metric and like things like Team Center France, TeamCenter =
Italy. They should be paid for by actuation Engineering in France and in =
Italy. So they're already included in the bu profit and loss. There's a =
whole bunch of things I just need to sort of walk you through the process =
on. But it's, it's a. It's a. Like it's gonna. We need to sort of have a =
really good response by end of day Monday. So today we need a good story =
internally like DT and then we can share it with sort of teams on Monday. =
That's a big one for today.

2:40
Sure. What's the story look like in your =
head? Like not knowing it and having dived into it. But like what's that =
what's like a. Two sentences. What's the story?

2:51
What I'm hoping to say is you're like, like your 5 million analysis is =
heavily overstated. Of the engineering apps that are being transferred or =
TSA'd X amount of them, like 40 of them are included in the standalone and =
then another 30% are included in the. Like be like the BU profit and loss. =
And then what's that leave? 30%. All right, like we'll agree to like, we =
should probably include 500k or something that's in my head, sort of. What =
are we, 50% we included in the standalone. So you've known about this from =
diligence. Ideally, it won't. It won't come out that way, I don't think.

3:54
Okay, so it's about how we spend it and how does Colin Gillis fit into=
 it.

4:00
So if it's. We essentially. Yeah, so we're saying that like. And=
 this is where there's another statement to hear is if we put in the =
standalone that engineering tooling costs $3 million, then they've known =
about this for years. But what's going to happen is we might have to go to =
each individual app and say, all right, NI Berestand, what's the rough =
licensing for this one? Like Siemens, what's the rough licensing for this =
one? You know that kind of stuff, don't you think?

4:31
Isn't that what they were doing that they didn't want to share with us?

4:39
I'm not sure what that is.

4:41
I think that, like the last time that=
 we had the conversation with Colin Gillis, that's exactly what they were =
doing is in building out that costing, my understanding was that they were =
determining which applications fall into TSA Eno1 or DT, and then the rough=
 approximate cost for those. And when I was asking Colin Gillis about, hey,=
 can we get. I just wanted a list of. Here's all of the apps and then =
here's their cost to like to work on that breakdown of TSA Eno 1. Here's =
the like, individual contributing cost that makes up this, like wider =
bucket and here's how it's accounted for. And they said no. And that's when=
 we got into the conversation about building in buffer. Right.

5:35
So I guess, I guess that. What I'm trying to understand is I felt that =
there was a. That's what we're working with Colin on what he's including, =
what he's not including. Has he responded to that?

5:51
I need to follow up with him today again about that.

5:58
Did you follow up with him yesterday?

6:00
No, we talked about it in the =
afternoon and I didn't send him the email yet.

6:11
Okay.

6:14
But we sent him the list of. It's very easy. Yes or no how many licenses =
and for the ones that are big that we know about I think that we've been =
doing that diligence on our own like the Veristand one. How much does this =
cost? How many users associated with it? Is it Ian outside of Colin? =
Because my fear is that Colin's only accounted for stuff in his area and =
then outside of Rockford there's other things.

6:53
Okay, okay. So. Okay, so I think let's follow up with Colin on this one =
asking when he can sort of help provide this. We're probably going to need =
a. A call anyway.

7:07
I'm just gonna send a call on Monday. Well we have =
a call I think let me see if we still have our call on Monday or Tuesday =
with Colin and I think that that's when we can sort of corner him about. If=
 we to your point can get our. Colin Gillis is going to be. Yeah. Tuesday =
at 3:30.

7:40
Yeah, we can't wait until. So can you follow up with him and=
 say hey Colin, is it possible to complete the below or complete the =
attached and just ask for by when? Yeah, because I thought we have the EM01=
 Tactical Item List that I thought we're just trying to tick this one off.

7:58
Yeah.

8:03
But so like just. And maybe just ping him around put me. =
Can you please make sure I'm on the pings in the emails though just pushes =
back or like he's tidy. I can follow up. Okay, so timber. What's your focus=
 for today?

8:27
So a good part out of that contract conversation at 6am =
Was I do have a resource in Rockford now.

8:35
Yeah.

8:35
So those TSA ones I'm gonna reach out to that resource, try and schedule.

8:39
Some time with them.

8:39
Be like hey can we get purchase orders for =
these so we can look at them see if they're truly dedicated and or not and =
then also track down any of the additional Rockford contracts because =
Claire's team doesn't have access to anything Rockford so gonna continue to=
 push that way. And then did anything come from the Jason Despina =
conversation yesterday about what we can share and what we can't share? I =
would like to. It's already too late. You could drops off at noon but I =
want to hit the ground running and make sure everything's set for any =
copies that we can start to work on and consider even if I have to go in =
and Say hey, hypothetically, if we can, you know, start some planning, can =
we use this app as an example to do some planning if we have to copy. I've =
also pushed for Alex to kind of look at the original SMO list that he has. =
So it's not data that we've shared with him as far as dispositions, but =
starting to identify super users for all his applications that he gave me =
the list for. So worst case scenario, you can start to get those and we'll =
identify those and get that ticked off of our work schedule as well. So =
that's kind of just pushing around all of that fun stuff.

10:00
Yeah. Okay, so update on that one was Dean responded with, and I'm just =
responding now with a very bullshit answer which was like I asked that the =
function assembly leads do this with your support. Can you send us a list =
of function contacts and we can make sure you get engaged, supported =
properly? Like, like it's like we're already working with them. Like we =
don't need, we need their approval, we don't need their support. So I guess=
 long story short is like I'm just gonna respond like I just need to be =
softer about like we've got it, don't worry about it and anything would do.=
 Is it mostly engineering, right. Or is it all functions?

10:49
So from the sharing of data the functions have seen what those dispositions=
 are and they're comfortable with it.

10:56
Right.

10:56
So even in the call with Ben Rossi the other day, he's like, I have no =
problem with you sharing this information. If we need to get someone in =
Wolverhampton moving these things, go ahead. But that's not legal, right? =
For information sharing and for a lot of it is engineering applications. So=
 we need to have that information sharing availability at least to Stevie =
and her team to, to use their best judgment to identify three people who =
can go out and procure the infrastructure as needed, whether that be a VPC =
or an actual server. So that's, that's primary number one.

11:30
So is that for day one or for day two?

11:33
Day one. Anything as a copy?

11:39
Yeah, if we need to go and get infrastructure like we're in, like if =
we need actual infrastructure like not just a, a shared drive like wearing =
District Blackwood, that's not good.

11:54
So there's some short sighted =
things in here that some of the functional leads are starting to realize.

11:59
Right.

12:00
So we've put copies for 100 some odd applications. Yeah=
, the assumption on that is okay, yes, we need these copied for actuations =
use. No one's gonna say come back and said we need these copied because =
Colin wants to retain the IP and we've confirmed that these ones that we're=
 worried about actuations use, they're already on actuation hardware on the=
 actuation network and actuation has access to it. It's Collins that =
doesn't have that.

12:33
Right, okay. Yeah. So he's talking about. It's =
almost like a reverse copy, right?

12:37
Exactly. So we're going to have =
some of those kind of. Spoke to Claire all wrote about that a little bit =
yesterday with the five homegrown applications that she's got in Indonesia.=
 I'm like, do you guys want to retain any of this information? She's like, =
I need to talk to the team over there to see what we need to retain. So =
they're kind of looking at it from that reverse copy aspect of it. But =
we're going to have to have some Collins people DT people go, yes, we want =
to keep this, we need to move it over. But again we need that landing zone.

13:10
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's an EI Cyber call today. I forwarded that =
one to you, Tim. That's where like we can raise a concern on a date. If we =
don't have luck on this, we're just going to start putting stuff wherever =
we want to put it. It's not great, it's not a good strategy, but we just =
need to sort of save where it goes so that when they do the lift on day two=
, we can say, hey guys, you need to pull all of these shares into the =
migrate to Saffron Scope. Yeah, really don't want to go that route. But =
like being literally two months out and you haven't got a landing zone. =
It's just beyond like a shared drive, like just beyond ridiculous to me.

13:54
You don't have a landing zone. You haven't told anyone what's coming =
home. So I. We have no one, we have, we have no one that you know, can =
start. I'm trying to backdoor this as best I possibly can without getting =
into legal trouble here. But if they're business managed apps, guess what? =
It's the business that supports it, not DT. Yeah, so it's not DTs already =
said this is on a business to figure out and we're like, okay, let us tell =
the business so they can start figuring out legal's like maybe, maybe we =
wait a little while. Right. So sooner or later it's going to be either you =
let us tell them or you just move all of these to TSA and figure it out. =
But we're not dt. We Want to actually do the work?

14:42
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Now let's. It's a fair point. Let's have this call =
today, Tim. And that way we like, we've done our diligence with the EY team=
 so then we can raise risks according appropriately without like. Cuz =
that's kind of the cardinal sin, right? Is throwing another EY team under =
the bus. Once we have the call today, it's. The gloves are off. So. But I'm=
 completely with you. Like this is. Yeah, I'm with you. Like I, I can't say=
 more about it without getting fired up because it's just. There's just so =
like there's just a lot of base things that you'd expect to have in place =
by now. We. We. I feel like we had them in place. Six weeks out on Hornet. =
It was a three month sign to close. So like. Yeah.

15:35
Anywho, just lack of forethought and it happens and it's fun. This isn't an=
 easy company to work around. But when we're getting raked over the coals =
because we've got stuff due for copies and we have no place to copy.

15:51
Yeah. No, I'm with you and I. It will like it's. Yeah. Once we clear the UI=
 hurdle today, then it goes up as a risk like shared driver landing zones =
are not in place to enable business managed apps. Copies, copy execution or=
 something. Right, Exactly. Like we can word it pretty viciously. Like 120 =
copies scheduled for the next two weeks will be delayed because the landing=
 zone isn't available. Everyone's like shit. Right? Like that's a. Yep, =
that's. That'll get. Well, not two weeks because we pushed the dates out. =
But like it's. Yeah. Anyway, I think. I think we're good. So Mac, I'm gonna=
 work with you on this Saffron ask and let's maybe just jump on a call in a=
 minute. Timbo, let us know if you. Who was the Rockford person. That name.=
 It's all good. I don't. I haven't heard of that name. Just any contact. =
Put Tori in. Tori's got some reasonable pull at Rockford.

16:58
Yep. Okay.

17:01
So just pull her into anything with regards to that. Okay, we'll do.

17:06
Yeah. I'm just glad I got the resource now to. To go forth and the. =
The team's willing to work with us. Just sometimes it. A lot of the times =
they don't have the data.

17:17
Do we. Do we want to bring them into the =
Stevie call or do we keep Stevie like. Yeah. It's a different call. Sorry.

17:28
No, I don't think we need to bring her. Them into the Stevie call per=
 se. I think we're gonna have to just get to a point where. When. What do =
you think that's actually viable and what. What's truly a risk to us on =
some of these transfer contracts. We're gonna have to make the. The judge =
or have Collins make a judgment call of. Okay, these are supposedly used by=
 five people. We can't find a PO for it. Are we truly concerned from an =
actuation point of view that day one's going to break should anything. =
Should anything with the contract not happen? Right. So we're gonna have to=
 just make that call.

18:07
Yeah, well. And that's what we like. And this =
is where I'm just cautious that I think we just need to maybe. Tim, just =
maybe send a. A note like a reply all to your contracts call yesterday. =
Because Jose's on that. I'd almost like to be proactive and say, hey, based=
 on yesterday's call, we're running well behind. I had a 6am call with the =
UK, Claire Drake. We've got a. What we think is a path to move forward. But=
 just letting you know that like the contract, like this task is well =
overdue and if he cares enough, he'll come in off the top rope. If he =
doesn't, we've put it into an email. The legal guy was on the email. Like, =
I think this is just our chance to softly say, hey, we're well behind. =
We've reforecast the. The date. If you could draft that note, Tim, just so =
that's a big cya for you and for us. Yep, that would be great.

19:16
If.

19:16
I'll draft that. Send it over just for making sure that you've worked=
 with a few of these people before and.

19:22
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the league=
. Like it's. It's not like a. Like we're here to scare you. It's just like =
this is like this is a known risk and this is what we're doing to move =
forward. It's. There may be potential that not all these are obtained by =
day one, I guess. Real. So.

19:37
Yeah.

19:38
And he knew that. So. Okay.

19:44
Yep. I'll drive that and get that over here.

19:48
Cool. Thanks, mate. All right, let's catch up in a jiffy.

19:53
Yeah. Let me know when you're free. Anthony. I'm at my desk.

19:57
All right, cool. All right, thank you.

19:59
Thanks.

19:59
Bye.

I&#x27;ll take a step back. The biggest risk is Colin Gillis&#x27;s =
location because that is used like they bill allocation model. And so what =
that means is let&#x27;s just say the all engineering licenses cost 100 =
million. Everyone gets a peanut butter spread based on an allocation metric=
 and like things like Team Center France, TeamCenter Italy. They should be =
paid for by actuation Engineering in France and in Italy. So they&#x27;re =
already included in the bu profit and loss. There&#x27;s a whole bunch of =
things I just need to sort of walk you through the process on. But =
it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a. It&#x27;s a. Like it&#x27;s gonna. We need to sort =
