Transcript:
0:00
Standard capital H colors and numbers are =
fixed. This page will. Will talk about summary task as well as task. This =
page will talk only about the task. And at the bottom, I have given the =
note as well that this particular tab does not include any summary task =
count. So this is like true task count, which are behind schedule or delay.

0:23
I want to send a screenshot to Jason and the spina, but that 364 =
scares me, so I'm not going to.

0:31
Well, or if you go to the day one =
dispositions tab, that's what Spinas wants, right?

0:39
Yeah.

0:39
This is linked to our master. This is. This is nothing to do with capital.

0:43
H. Yeah, this is linked to. This is just positioning.

0:47
Yeah, dispositioning.

0:48
Yeah.438. Oh, because we removed those three =
apps.

0:54
Yes, we removed those three apps, but those will show up here =
because we have not removed those from our master. But I have removed those=
 from capital H. No, that.

1:06
That's cool. And this is where Parry. I =
might just need your help on. We've communicated 441 for a long time. Well,=
 not a long time, but for quite a while. And we are gonna slowly go down =
now. So we definitely went down to three because of Tori. We'll go down =
another four and then even more because of Tim's dt. I think you're =
chopping about six, Tim. So I guess what we just need to make sure of is, =
like, we know our story and we can all speak to because Jason and Espina =
will be like, well, what changed? Right. And if you have, like, a very =
confident, correct answer, they don't ask any more questions. But if you, =
like, fumble around and have no clue. All right, let's have a call. That's =
weird. Like, we try to avoid those things. So this is really good, man. So =
just for context, guys, the three apps we have removed are engineering =
tools that Tory has agreed to remove.

2:10
And for that I have.

2:15
Yeah.

2:15
And there is fourth one as well, this one which is not present =
in this particular list.

2:25
Let me look at that. Yeah. Okay.

2:29
What about the three that we already put through change control? Right. So =
we've removed the three that we did earlier. Like what? Like at this point,=
 two, three weeks ago. Right. And then additionally, we removed these web =
app ones. And then there's one more that you're reviewing now. Right? =
Another one.

2:48
So we can't take. We can't take it out of the columns =
inventory. So I guess. Amber, which file. This is like, this is. This is a =
cleanup activity. I think the one thing we need to discuss. It's important =
but what we need to discuss right now is that task count because we're. =
We're ballooned again. Okay so if we look at this one here. So I guess Matt=
, can you provide an overview of what's still outstanding and what our plan=
 is for the 71 and 364.

3:20
These are upcoming so we might not need to =
worry about this. But I think 71 and 24 needs cleanup. This can be easy one=
 if let's say Tim says that okay, obtain local contract and POA review is =
in progress. I will just flip this to in progress and we are good. This =
will become zero. Should we do that? I'll blow up this so that you can view=
 and most of these are contract related so opt in contracts TSA rights =
secured by contracts team and yeah it's one is related to CC Draft act to =
finalize and provide sign off. And this one is one of the four apps which =
is still there. The web app from supply chain 3 we remove this one is still=
 there because this was not in the list. So I have not deleted this. If I'm=
 not clear then I am talking about this thing I've removed. Mm web app, =
saving web app and transfer web app. The fourth one is listed as project =
server web app but it is not present in capital H in our pan. Instead we =
are having supply chain escalation web app. Which is this one. Which is =
this one.

4:50
Yeah. So this is the plan. So it's the ones that. These =
ones I'm I'm less worried about. It's the stuff that's coming due.

5:00
Okay. So stuff that is due. So this is the stuff that is due.

5:05
So if you look at past due.

5:07
Yeah, this is. These are the past due.

5:12
We had extract data in April.

5:28
What does that extract tied to?

5:31
CC drive.

5:33
CC draft.

5:35
All right, let me work with the team =
on that one today.

5:43
And then these are the finalized actuation landing=
 zones for EMEA Bangalore.

5:55
Harry, do you mind pinging Gopi and just =
ask if any of the. Well, we should have it in our inventory even around the=
 tech data. Yeah, like I'm just thinking can we. If we can use teams, I =
think we can set up the team site and put them there and then essentially =
make Shankar and Mohan owners and then let them run it from there. And =
that's kind of a handoff. Yeah, but I just, I'm wondering if any of those =
are. Yeah. And I guess you can just put it onto that chat that you've got =
with the Bangalore team. Oh, Redwood Tools. That's it. And just maybe Look.=
 Hey guys. Just like there are delays in DT setting up the folder =
structures. Do we think it's feasible to use a teams folder for all =
Bangalore copied apps?

7:07
Yeah. Sorry, I was just writing. I'm typing it=
. Should I just. I'm just gonna ask.

7:23
So that clears identity landing =
zone. She wants identify and then it's my.

7:39
Solution.

7:43
To buy a solution. Why are you identifying a landing zone?

7:49
So some of them, 22 of them are equipment tied ABS that have identified a =
landing zone. Those aren't the buyer solution ones, but those are the =
dedicated. Right. They're tied to equipment. So I had 88 finalized hosting =
and then 66 then need the infrastructure team's input.

8:20
So maybe I don't know what you're referring to.

8:23
So the buyer solution ones are buyer solution data extract.

8:26
Oh yeah.

8:33
You still have to create a copy for buyer solution data extract.

8:39
Yeah. We still need a landing zone.

8:41
Exactly.

8:48
Do we. Or we just put it into move it. Well, I guess if we're having the =
conversation. So. And are these actual data extracts like they have. Do =
they have data? That's where I think.

9:15
The HR one definitely does.

9:19
Is that coming out of the. I guess the. The HO one. I'm struggling a =
little bit with Tim because. Can you do that pre day one or do you need to =
wait until day one to do this? Wow, sorry. The landing zone bit. Yes, 14th =
of April. So that's. That's fair. So is this identify landing zone or is =
this like identified like transfer approach.

9:52
This is more along the =
landing zone aspect itself. Like where are we going to put this information=
?

9:59
But it's going to.

10:00
Specifically we want to. These is =
Simscape Simulink, one of the ones we want to descope or. No.

10:11
Let'S.

10:13
No, never mind. Oh no, it's one data whatchamacallit.

10:22
Colin actually accepted it for tsa.

10:29
My double check that too. That's=
 why it was so salient in my head. I was like, why do I actively remember. =
That's good. I can find the.

10:53
So I guess the one thing team, if you =
could just make sure that your dispositions are accurate in here. Because =
now we've had a couple changes.

11:09
Yeah. That falls within enterprise =
engineering and it's part of EN01. This one is Stemscape Simulink. Yes.

11:26
So Pari, I think we need to look at that file that you're generating =
for EN01 and I think we just need a very clean page of all the change =
requests either in progress or that have been approved.

11:40
I agree. Yeah. It's starting to get Confusing because of everything that =
I've. Yeah, I agree. Yes.

11:48
And I think we need like the one we had =
for when we're doing dispositioning, that was okay, but we need a bit more =
detail. Right. What was the disposition? What is the new disposition and =
the why? I think we need that. James Wang actually has like a pretty good =
template that I think we need to leverage because I don't think we can wait=
 until the 25th to move forward because there's some. There's some =
inconsistencies here that like, I think we can walk through. But when you =
show Despina and Jason like, well, that's changed. Oh, actually has that =
one. This one has as well. They lose a lot of confidence in. In what's =
behind. So if we could maybe just set that up, that would be good. So, Mac,=
 do we have a plan for these ones? Have you worked with Hari and Tim?

12:51
I worked with Tim last night. There's like five main buckets.

13:00
But we.

13:01
Have a plan for each of them. Yeah, we have all of the =
upcoming tasks for this week tied to an action and I think we have a good =
view of what's feasible and what's not. And then a bunch are pending.

13:20
Okay, can you share what's not feasible?

13:29
Yeah, the tr.

13:36
Because they've kind of have got us and this is honestly how they should be=
 running it. But. So any changes not feasible are going to get reviewed.

13:48
I mean they're. The two big categories are identify the hosting type.

14:01
We just. Let's just look at the detail. Let's just look at the line =
items.

14:30
Hold on.

14:35
We can hear you, Mac.

14:37
Yeah, hold on one second. I have to switch.

14:41
While he's doing that. =
Anthony, I just want to give you an update on contracts. So anything that =
we. We haven't found. Alex is going to ask Stevie and Andy to send an email=
 out with. Hey guys, this is the pending applications where we cannot find =
contracts. We've exhausted every, every possible way of doing that. Please =
confirm that they're in use. If you cannot confirm that they're in use and =
are and provide a contract latest PO or tie it to specific machinery, we =
are going to remove them from our list and you will not have access to it. =
Day one. So we've done agreed with.

15:19
We've got new to that.

15:21
That's what Alex's plan is. Because it's just, it's how it's got to be at =
this point in time.

15:26
If people can't agree. I just am kind of =
gobsmacked, I guess. Yeah, we'll see what that does? Yeah, because like, as=
 you know, we can't take it off. We can't go and uninstall an app from a =
Centuan test rig. Like, oh, completely agree.

15:47
And I'm not worried about, I'm not worried about the stuff that's tied to =
test rigs.

15:51
Yeah.

15:51
But when someone's told me it's perpetual =
license and someone comes back and tells me, no, it's not a perpetual =
license, it's freeware, I can't, I can't be running around in circles like =
that. So, yeah, on actuation to do the work and, and get it figured out, =
because there's no way that we can continue to just putz around and have =
them figure the shit out. Like, I, I, I like my job, but this has just been=
 frustration of how the, do these people not know what the hell they have?

16:21
Yeah, yeah, no, and that's a great outcome. I appreciate us getting =
there. I'm just, I hope they actually happens because yeah, it might be =
just a bit of a scare tactic that won't have a lot behind it, but hopefully=
 the scare tactic kicks us in to get another 10:15 back.

16:43
Right, exactly.

16:46
No, no, that, that sounds good. So hopefully that =
works and we get some movement. But yeah, to your point. Right, like, I =
don't respond to emails, but then a SRI sends one out saying, hey guys, do =
this or this. Then I respond. So it's, it's, yeah, that's. No, I, I agree. =
I, I think that's also. Timmy, do you mind just, I said to, I don't know if=
 you're on the call last night I said to Despina I'd draft her a note to =
send to about the, like, essentially it's a forward of the email that we've=
 already sent that Disbina is going to just reply on top of.

17:33
Okay.

17:34
And I would just. Actually, I can do it. Let me just share it with =
you before it's, before it goes out. Because that latest bit, I would just =
want to, if you could confirm to Alex that's happening, because I don't =
want to say it's happening and it doesn't happen because that's a pretty =
big statement they're going to make by doing that. And if we say it =
happened, it's going to happen and it doesn't, then it's on us to chase =
down.

18:02
So, yeah, no, no worries. Alex and I talked about it at the =
8:00.

18:11
Yeah.

18:12
So let me make sure when he talks to Stevie today=
, they're apparently dealing with another outage and Wolverhampton. So let =
me talk to. I will get it in writing that he's going to talk to Stevie =
about that. And when we have another meeting later on today at 10, we'll =
basically say, chris, this is our plan. Are you good with that? And see =
what he says as well. So Chris will get Andy on board, Alex will get Stevie=
 on board, and I'll make sure that I'm cc'd on that email saying that we =
need to do this.

18:45
Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Cool. All right, man. Thank you. =
Solid update. Did you get any more come in? I stream not.

18:53
I've got confirmation that some stuff is freeware now instead of a =
perpetual license. So it doesn't it our number, but not drastically.

19:03
Yeah, because we already had it changes the percentage. So that's good for =
the better.

19:07
Yeah. Yep. So I've got to make those updates today. I've=
 got the email confirmation on all of those. So if they say, oh, it's a =
contract now, then it's on them because the person told me. So. Yeah, I =
will track that. But yeah.

19:27
Okay.

19:27
Yeah.

19:27
What are you doing for the freeware? Are you recategorizing it or are you =
just marking it as received?

19:32
I'm marking it as NA in our sheet and =
we'll have to recategorize it in our masters freeware.

19:39
Yeah, I can. Right. All righty. All right, Max, so run us through this one.=
 So what number of tasks feasible? All right, let's talk about the =
finalized hosting.

19:54
So for finalized hosting, there's 22 that are =
tied to equipment. And so that we know that the landing zone will be the =
current site that that equipment is at. And Tim can mark those complete =
this week. So we know that those are feasible. There's 66 that are left =
that are pending the landing zone. So this is the activity identify the =
landing zone or hosting. And so we need.

20:35
And that's due this week. =
Yeah. And this is.

20:41
Well, is this due in the next seven days?

20:43
Finalized hosting? Are you talking about current state or future state?

20:48
It's a combination of both.

20:51
Well, we've got row seven is =
landing zone. Row two is hosting. I assume they're not the same.

21:00
The landing zone. I mean, this is just how they're categorized in Capital =
Edge. They're broken out because it was broken out in the way that we're =
talking about them. Really. And so this is finalize the landing zone are =
the ones that specifically say finalize the landing zone. And then we have =
a separate chunk that are finalized, the hosting zone. So that includes =
TSAs or logical separations.

21:31
So this is current state number two.

21:34
Yeah, exactly. And then seven is future state.

21:40
So it might make sense how many of those. So if we just stay on one row at =
a time. Finalized hosting, current state. I think Parry got a bit of detail=
 back from Colin yesterday. Does this include Parry's stuff?

21:57
No, I haven't gotten feedback from Par yet.

22:01
I'm sorry. Back. Yeah, =
we can connect.

22:04
So let's. Let's just look at. So if you go to the =
tasks, we're saying the tasks tab. Sorry. And just filter on hosting. =
Scroll to the left.

22:44
Left this one and make it smaller.

23:04
Keep going down. Going down. So these look like they're all transfers, all =
of them. So Tim, I think the question on this one is more around validating=
 that they are on a dedicated thing. That they're dedicated like a. Because=
 I think if you look at like what we don't want to have have happen is this=
. These CATIA ones as example, sit on a license server in Maidstone and =
that gets cut off on day one.

23:59
Yeah. So I think I've got confirmation=
. I'll double check my notes, but I believe I have confirmation that all of=
 them are on the test rigs themselves. These are one of those.

24:11
Are they commenting?

24:15
No, there's not. At least not that I've seen.

24:18
Ambar.

24:21
Sorry, what's the question?

24:23
Are they comments?

24:26
Comments? Yes. So comments column is there but nothing is populated. =
I populated it with dispositions of application.

24:35
So the comments columns being used then?

24:38
Yes.

24:52
Look, that's fine. I think what we just want to update this is these need =
to tie to essentially columns in the inventory. This one just needs to have=
 current state hosting. And then we just need to have a few options here =
because I just want to make sure that if we ever get a question on. Hey, =
Sephram Link is actually hosted in Maidstone. We can say no, it's actually =
hosted in here.

25:26
Yeah, Amara and I connected about that this morning.=
 He said it will take some time to get the. I think what we need at the =
core is the application ID tied to the task ID so that we can get =
information out of our inventory. Inventory?

25:44
Yeah, we can just vlook up the work plan. Well, I guess we just need to =
like. I guess what I'm just trying to say is like I think we've got tasks =
in cap Edge that essentially can be columns in our inventory. If that makes=
 sense. Matt. Yeah, so like this one, review application hosting =
requirements, transfer of deck, space, desk, whatever that is. Could be =
like. Like local dash, Antoine or wherever it is for this one, I don't know=
. Or it could be shared something. But I think that's. We just want to make=
 sure that we don't just get all this done and then have like no, nothing =
to back it up.

26:32
Yeah, exactly.

26:33
Because questions will come =
post day one when ship breaks. So like that's what we just need to be =
prepared for. Paris saw it a little bit in Hornet. Right. You get the most =
random rogue questions that you expected to have answers for. Like they =
will say moba Extern. Where is that hosted? It's not working anymore and we=
 need to answer it just as a heads up. The other thing as well is some of =
this probably was in the initial SMO file.

27:12
It had PC or server.

27:17
Okay, okay. Okay. Well if it's on PC.

27:25
PC, I'm much worried =
about it, especially at the site location.

27:29
Yeah, maybe we think =
about. I'm just trying to make sure that we hand over a very clean. Well we=
 have like our story very buttoned up. Okay. So Tim, are these feasible by =
Friday? There's a lot here. Yeah.

27:52
So I'm working with the team to =
kind of get that. That pulled together in the actuation calls that we're on=
. So that's our key tasks for the day are basically or for the week are =
contracts. Of course, hosting locations. Anything that's on a server is =
what we're worried about. Anything that's on a PC, not so much. We still =
want that information as to. Yes, it's on this PC specifically, but if it =
says PC and it's at a site. Emily, to kind of mark that as complete, =
especially for all these transfers. And then it's the hosting locations for=
 each of these as well as getting any current hosting locations and then =
finalizing where we're going to land these. I think once we have if it's =
the PCs, then that's going to stay the landing zone. So that'll knock those=
. But if it's a server, those are the ones we just going to have to dig in =
and look at.

28:50
Yeah, okay. Yeah, let's just have a quick like =
conversation on like on the on team, just around what we want to put as the=
. The options. Because I think to your point, server dash dedicated server =
dash local. Sorry. Well, let's pick one I guess is what I'm trying to say.

29:08
Yep.

29:09
And then let's just make that consistent throughout. Okay=
. All right, Mac, what's the next one? Sorry, I know we're running over, =
but this, this is pretty important. What's the next milestone activity we =
need to review through the next. So these are feasible. Tim. Sorry.

29:24
Here, I just put the expanded one in here. This is the one with the full =
set of columns that we got out of the export. Let me just filter for the =
next one. And these have the actions that I discussed yesterday with Tim.

29:43
Okay. And then I guess because. So these sort of. So the dedicated is=
 where we don't know the current state and we're just trying to find =
gotchas in there. Right. Like that's the purpose. Right. Like, oh shit, =
this is actually hosted in somewhere else. It's going to be cut off from =
day one, finalize those things, determine authentication method. Can you =
click on that one?

30:14
There's a bunch of these. 52 of them.

30:23
Yeah, A lot of these are transfers.

30:25
And it's just basically =
confident this is local versus identity. Right, Tim?

30:31
Yes, exactly. So how are they accessing the application? Right. If it's. If=
 they need to log in with their. This is more of a day two activity than =
anything else. But if anything breaks on day one, well, it's.

30:46
It's kind of not though, right? Because to your point, if anything is =
somehow tied to. Well, I guess workday is not changing. Nothing should =
break on. We should just know it. Anyway, I guess they'll still be tied.

31:07
To their Collins email address though, so. Right. Like if they're not=
 using SSO and they want to reset their password, it will go to their =
Collins email address, right?

31:20
Well, it depends. Like applications =
authenticate multiple different ways. I'm assuming that 95% of these are =
just ping me and I'll give you an account. I'll spell your name wrong. Like=
 there's no rhyme or reason. Sorry. There's no traceability back to your =
RTX id, I guess is what I'm trying to say. I think that would make sense. I=
 assume these and some of these probably don't even have an authentication =
method. Like, correct.

31:54
I mean, if it's tied to the PC, if it's =
posted on a PC, it's probably not something that multiple people need to =
log into.

32:01
Right, Right. Because it's a. Yeah, it's a. It's token. =
Wow. Token with it. Anyway, I think we just need to work through that. I =
think the. Shit, I can't. We can't push all these back.

32:15
Well, I think we have a good story, especially on certain things like =
landing zones and other information, because we literally shared the =
dispositions with them on Thursday of last week and we warned everyone that=
 if we couldn't share the dispositions, things were going to get pushed =
back because they didn't have the information to provide this. So I'm not =
saying we're not at risk or it's not a concern, but I'm saying there is =
justification for why these are pushed back.

32:47
I regret putting so much in Cap edge now. It's always fucked ya.

32:52
I can eat that tool.

32:56
Okay, and then. So if we keep just scrolling =
down slowly. Matt. Yeah, Copy the landing zone. Barry, these. Can we get =
this done for these? If we agree on teams which Josh already has set up.

33:12
Yeah. So that's where the ones. Yeah, the copy. The ones that are =
Josh's. I sent him an email last week and we have a call this weekend. I =
followed up yesterday, but he hasn't responded back. Basically in Excel =
being like, okay, where do they live that way I'm like, like, okay, they =
live on this team site and it's been shared. Then we have like an actual. =
Like, each line item has a location verified. But hopefully he can get that=
 to us today, in which case we can start saying that it's already copied in=
 there. You get what I mean?

33:59
Sort of.

34:04
So these are. Majority of these are all Josh's. So I already gave him a =
list of. Here are all your copied applications. Can you give me where they =
live and if they're already on the team site that's been separated and =
where he was like, okay, I'm adding in Chase Johnson and Adam Crandall.

34:28
Are you on that team, sir?

34:30
I am not. But you said you are.

34:33
Am I?

34:35
You said it on the call, but I'll get that confirmation.=
 I want to be on that team site.

34:41
So Maple agreements. Maple. What do=
 you think he called it? Just ping him and ask him to add us both. He gave =
me access to something.

34:56
Yeah.

34:57
And I'm just looking at my =
teams on the Colin side. Nothing. There's also so many teams that I might =
just be missing it. But what about identifying is asking to add us? Parry. =
We'll get in there and then we'll see what's already in there. And. And I =
saw. Is there a testing session for Rockford Bangalore's Thursday or.

35:26
No, the existing session for Bangalore is Thursday. Is that what you =
asked?

35:32
Yeah. Is the testing.

35:35
Yeah, I want. So I wanted to =
send out that email to Tori before I. I already sent out the email to the =
tester saying that, hey, we're gonna be adding you to a Call of Duty =
Thursday so that you can help scope and verify the applications that we'll =
be copying over. Specifically Homegrown. So, yeah, they. Yeah. And then now=
 that we've also sent that to Tori. I feel a lot more comfortable adding =
them to the Thursday call.

36:04
Okay. And so Parry, there is a page the =
Matt put together and we're gonna have to test it, which is around copy =
sign off.

36:14
Okay. Yeah.

36:16
And essentially It's. It's in =
PowerPoint and Mac. If you can share it with Parry, that'd be good. We're =
gonna need essentially like. Yeah, if you could just fill that out and. And=
 then we'll just. That's what we use to get sign off. We ran Andy Rag =
through it very quickly, but ideally, like we can't say an app's done until=
 actuation signed off and then they take ownership of the team site.

36:54
That makes sense. Yeah.

36:56
Yeah. Let me find a link. I think once we =
give it and I think maybe we'll just add a sentence pair. If you could take=
 a note of this. Our handoff is not giving it to everyone, it's giving it =
to the super user.

37:09
Yeah.

37:10
So if they've got 300 people that =
use it, we're giving it to the super user. The super user needs to give it =
to the 300 people. Yeah. And there might just need to be some comms and =
whatnot, but I'll let them manage that. Okay, cool. All right. And if you =
keep scrolling down Max Identify active user. Use super user to sign off on=
 tool. I thought we've done all this.

37:38
No, we have. I just want to go=
 back and mark it as such and I want to make sure that it is the right =
applications. But yeah.

37:49
Tim, did we ever get an updated listing from=
 Andy Rag on who they want as the super users or the ones we're using were =
fine.

37:58
The ones we were using were pretty much fine. They basically =
took the SMO file and plugged in the. The app owners from that file. So I'm=
 going to look through that and double check all of those. But there are =
some. Some separations on this one. But I think for the most part that that=
 one should be pretty well set.

38:20
Like employment separations, you =
mean?

38:26
No, no. For any actuation super users that we needed. I didn't=
 say anything about separation.

38:36
Oh, okay. So I think we're good on =
these ones here. And then identify. Yeah, that's next one. Identify. Keep =
going down Current sa. We discussed that. Keep scrolling down M. Yeah, let =
me switch my corner.

38:59
Yeah, and that's the Excel that I want Excel =
Josh to fill out, right? Yeah.

39:08
And then Excel. Do you want Josh to =
fill out? Oh, look. Yeah, okay. Yeah, keep going down. These are mostly =
transfers. Yeah, Keep Going down. Application hosting, keep going down. =
Okay. All right, so team, let's see where we end up. I think as long as =
we're, we're pushing this as best we can. Please update Cap Edge as like at=
 the end of the day we're going to need to look at do this review like =
every morning now. Just because there's so many tasks coming coming up this=
 week that we're just gonna have to watch this burn down unfortunately. =
Makes sense. I think once we get over this hump we'll get like. Once we get=
 over this hump we'll be. I think we'll be in a lot better position because=
 I'm looking at Amber's chart. If you look at the word plan summary. Once =
we get over. This is a seven day look. So let's go to an extra. Once we get=
 over the 22nd. Once we get over the 21st. Well, we've got another 129 next=
 Friday. All right, well I guess we're, we're six weeks out from day one. =
This is what it's like so. All right, so team, let's stay super tight on =
this. Please be very diligent with Cap Edge. Ari, if you could please have =
a take a shot at the change request tracker and I, I think we almost hide =
the old one that we had and put in a, a new one. It's just painful because =
we've got cot staging tab. We've got things in other places. Yeah. Just =
ping me if you want to sort of chat through the approach on that. But I =
think that's pretty important today because there's going to be work plan =
impacts.

41:04
Yeah. Especially since we're changing dispositions across. =
So I'm going to take a shot at creating and so the change request is =
separate. You're talking about like actual. The changes that we want to =
like track. Right. Internally and then the change request form is whatever =
that gets filled out. How it gets filled out.

41:27
Yeah. I think to be honest, is it almost one of the same thing? Like it's =
just the approval status that will change right on the change request form =
or does that not have everything you think we need?

41:41
I don't think it has everything we need. It's more so costing and cost =
changes than it is worried about scope changes. Yeah. Which is why like =
they're like oh, if it's like what's the costing impact and stuff. Which is=
 why I'd rather just create a new tab and have like our like here are all =
the changes, this is why and a breakdown and who we're getting approval =
from and I think it'll be a lot clearer and then we can go back and just =
fill out that form for the formality of it.

42:13
Yeah, okay. I'm just =
thinking, I'm saying a few tasks and if you put that together. Parry. Let's=
 review this afternoon because I want to clear some of the noise. Like I'm =
seeing Team Center France pop up a couple times. Team Center Italy stuff. =
We know we're descoping. So I'm almost thinking that we can pull it =
together.

42:38
Let's have a look at it.

42:39
Because there's kind of a =
strength of knowing it's going to. These are all changing. So I guess =
anyway if you can pull it together, then review or review. Because I don't =
want to keep looking at stuff that we know is not going to be in here =
anymore.

42:55
100%. And all of these also get attached to their parent =
tasks. So it's like numerous tasks, numerous numbers that change for each =
app. So.

43:07
Right, right, yeah. For example, like if we get rid of like=
 Team Center France, we clear five apps. Like we could potentially be =
removing 200 tasks today, which is going to cause a scene. What's that?

43:21
Sorry, Tim, what's the total task number again?

43:24
2297.

43:28
So 3000 tasks for three people. A thousand tasks.

43:32
Okay.

43:33
A person basically.

43:37
Think about it that way.

43:40
3 or 4 like pair Mac and I kind of running through that stuff. You get to =
clear some of the tasks but you're not assigned any ownership in capital =
Edge.

43:50
You can give me some just for.

43:55
Feel good about himself =
contracts, going over.

43:59
To it.

44:03
Dealing with different. I'll =
happily exchange with you. I'll happily exchange. You can deal with the =
spina and you can take other folks. No, no, I get it guys. I do get it. And=
 this is honestly what like there is a ton in here and we dispositioned so =
quickly and like Mac was like grinding to get all this done that we knew =
that there were going to be changes. Right. And the changes are coming. So =
we expected this. And now I think we just need to try and keep ourselves =
because I think to the other point Tim, is you don't want another set of =
hands in cap edge playing around with these tasks. Like we're already =
getting a bit messy just because there's so many tasks and I guess that's =
so it's a fair point though. So let's chat through like what's the best way=
 to manage this? Right. So we all need to update tasks. Like I think a lot =
of work we had Amber doing is now done. Right. Like in terms of like this =
dashboarding is just off the charts and it's awesome. And so I think now =
that we've got through this bit, how do we best use Amber in his time? =
Right. Like Parry, there's Bangalore stuff for sure. But what's the. The =
best use? Like. But I'm thinking, let me think through it man. Because I =
want to get you to like fully like you've owned this, you've crushed it. I =
want to sort of get you something else to. To own and run. Let me sort of =
get back to you this afternoon. Well tomorrow, tomorrow morning your time. =
Yeah, sure.

45:58
Anthony. We can connect on the email. I usually just =
send an email and a day our day which then you'll see in the morning. So =
we'll just, we can just talk as to what we want to send.

46:14
Cool. All right guys. So let's, let's catch up. But Tim, I do hear your =
point, right? It is a ton and I, I think we just need to stay tired at the =
hip and I will try and see if we can do a co location sometime soon. Let me=
 sort of chat to the team and then see where things are at. I'll also see =
where will's that as well, to be honest because we might do Miami. Does =
anyone oppose to Miami? Sorry, what's that?

46:49
It's so dreary in New =
York. Take me to Miami for sure.

46:53
Okay.

46:54
There's apparently snowing in Boston so.

46:58
Dude, it was. I went to my =
fiance's parents house and it was literally snow up there on Saturday. It's=
 mid April. Where is she from? It's the New York, New Jersey border.
