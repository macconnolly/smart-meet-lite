IT Functional Alignment and UAT Readiness Coordination

Two colleagues discuss ongoing IT readiness and testing coordination for an=
 upcoming business transformation, specifically focusing on UAT (User =
Acceptance Testing), cross-functional alignment, and dashboard/reporting =
requirements.

---

Main Topics Discussed

1. **Personal Updates & Setting =
the Stage**
   - Both participants exchange brief updates about their =
weekends, which included a wedding and extensive travel for connecting =
flights to Dallas.
   - The call shifts quickly to a dashboard review for a=
 transformation/testing program.

2. **Background: Workshop & Current =
Status**
   - Workshop held on May 15th in Charlotte scoped changes in =
processes, subprocesses, and systems, with a focus on impacts to supply =
chain, procurement, and IT (including legal entity updates in ERP).
   - PMO produced a deck (located in the UAT folder) summarizing process =
changes and mapping systems, data flows, and testing requirements.
   - Key Outcomes:
       - Supply chain and procurement are significantly =
impacted and are leading related system/process cutovers.
       - IT faces notable change due to legal entity adjustments.

3. **Testing & Coordination Challenges**
   - A large number of systems and=
 processes require testing and alignment.
       - Approximately 22 systems=
 need to complete UAT for BRV Go Live scheduled for August 1, 2025.
       - 10 non-BRV systems will go live before July.
       - Additional 52 systems are scheduled for Go Live between August and=
 September.
   - Main concern: misalignment between IT/system testing and =
functional/process testing windows.
   - Need to strengthen the connection =
between IT and functional teams (e.g., ERP, supply chain, data/analytics) =
for calendarizing testing, sharing test scripts, and ensuring required =
data/info is available.

4. **Dashboard & Reporting Needs**
   - Leadership (including Jeff and Sukai) is demanding clear and =
up-to-date readiness status, covering SIT (System Integration Testing) and =
UAT.
       - Dashboard must include SIT/UAT readiness, tester =
identification, knowledge transfer, test script completion, and possible =
addition of a heat map.
   - Focus is on end-to-end status reporting, not =
just siloed work-streams.
   - Functions expect IT to be closely partnered =
on test scenario development and coordination.
   - There needs to be =
executive visibility into all workstreams and their current readiness, =
beginning June 6.

5. **Governance Structure: 'Four in a Box' & UAT =
Roster**
   - 'Four in a Box' model discussed as a way to assure proper =
cross-functional representation and governance:
       - Composed of =
functional leads, sub-functional leads, IT leads, and sub-functional IT =
leads (from both Honeywell and Athens).
       - UAT roster should also =
include UAT coordinators, test leads, and testers.
       - Some roles (i.e=
., test leads and testers) are yet to be identified for all sub-functions =
and systems.
   - UAT roster and governance structures need to be finalized=
 and used to drive IT-functional alignment.

6. **Immediate Action Items & =
Next Steps**
   - Develop a comprehensive dashboard by Friday (by June 6, =
2025) for leadership reporting.
   - Calendarize and set up alignment =
meetings (MOS - Management Operating System connects) between IT =
workstreams and functional teams within this and next week.
   - Finalize the 'Four in a Box' structure/governance and identify all =
relevant functional and technical test owners and leads.
   - Develop and maintain UAT rosters and logistics (including workspace, =
credentials, access).
   - Remove or adjust specific date references (e.g.,=
 June 13 for readiness prep) due to variability in workstream testing =
windows.
   - Prepare and adapt executive reporting slides based on =
evolving numbers/roles as alignment progresses.
   - Track and report =
progress in standing executive calls (currently Fridays, cadence may shift)=
.

Key Dates & Figures

- **Workshop Date:** May 15, 2025, in =
Charlotte.
- **BRV Go Live:** August 1, 2025 (UAT for ~22 systems must =
complete by mid-July).
- **Other Go Lives:**
    - 10 systems pre-July.
    - 52 systems between August and September 2025.
- **Dashboard Readiness Review:** By June 6, 2025.

---

Roles & Responsibilities (to finalize/track):

- Functional Leads, =
Sub-functional Leads (Honeywell/ Athens)
- IT Function and Sub-function =
Leads
- UAT Coordinators (Pierce, Sriram, etc.)
- Test Leads & Testers =
(identify outstanding roles)
- Operational Separation Lead(s) (known roles =
like Paul)

---

Follow-Ups & Action Items

- Create and refine =
dashboard/tracker, incorporating readiness heatmaps if helpful.
- Schedule and document MOS meetings for IT-function alignment during this =
and next week.
- Finalize UAT roster and 'Four in a Box' governance model.
- Clarify and communicate calendarized test windows per workstream (ERP, =
supply chain, etc.).
- Prepare executive-facing weekly (Friday) reporting.
- Plan for testing logistics: workspace, credentials, tool access, and =
sign-off procedures.
- Adjust numbers and reporting as functional/IT =
alignment progresses.

---

Discussion Points for Next Review

- Progress on dashboard and tracker set-up.
- Success and bottlenecks in =
MOS meetings and alignment.
- Identification of all required roles and =
finalization of UAT roster.
- Clarity on test schedule overlaps/gaps, and =
coverage for go-live windows.
- Leadership feedback on reporting and =
readiness status.

Can you hear me?

0:01
Yeah. Can you hear me?

0:03
Yeah.

0:04
Did you have a nice weekend?

0:06
Kind of quiet weekend. I spent about seven hours in the air yesterday,=
 so.

0:10
Oh.

0:11
Which wasn't. No, it was just connecting flights.

0:13
Oh. Yeah.

0:14
To get me to. To Dallas.

0:16
What's your airline?

0:19
I don't have one, but yesterday I was an American, so it's just. Yeah.=
 Just ended up connecting.

0:29
Yeah.

0:29
There. There's some direct =
ones, but yeah, this one was just a bit of a wait, so. But no. How was =
yours?

0:36
It was nice. What did we do? We had a wedding on Saturday. So =
that was fun. That was our big event. And otherwise not too much. Just hung=
 out with my family. My parents live here, so.

0:49
Had some nice family time in Denver.

0:51
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

0:52
Okay. Nice.

0:53
Yeah, that's great.

0:54
Cool. So that's always fun.

0:56
Yeah. And it was. It was a really beautiful weekend. I think it had =
been raining for the last like two or three weeks here. So everybody was =
just ready to be outside and it was nice.

1:05
So nice.

1:08
Okay, so let's do dashboard review. We have a little bit of time.

1:13
Yeah. And I want to make sure. So you heard a couple of these things. =
Piping up on the call with it. So what's happening is to bring you up to =
speed, we had this workshop on the 15th where we laid out this whole. And I=
 think you may have a view into that deck. It's in the UAT folder. So PMO =
put together all these processes, what's changing? And then a view of what =
are the systems, what are the data flows. Well, more so processes and sub =
processes, what's changing, what are the systems that it's touching, what =
is the data that's needed, what environment, et cetera. So we had a whole =
day workshop in Charlotte and coming out of it, it was clear that supply =
chain, for example, a lot of what you saw now and heard on this call, this =
purchase order, sales order cutover, it's all supply chain LED and =
procurement led. And it's going to impact from an IT perspective. IT =
impacts, you know, the whatever legal entity changes they're doing. Well, I=
 guess it flows down into, based on the LE changes that are needed in the =
erp that is a little bit above market level, if you will, or maybe it's a =
bit more of a market level to say, okay, that's all legal entity related =
changes. Rob and our EY team are putting together this whole cutover =
strategy and they'll stand up a command center and they'll talk through =
some of that stuff that Jeff was rambling about. On Friday on. Okay, we =
need a hypercare. We need this model, that model. This all bakes into that =
for the purposes of what we need to do with peers. One of the outcomes of =
that workshop was, listen, I've got a crapload of systems that are getting =
tested. I've also got a crapload of processes that the functions need to =
change and test. There needs to be some alignment between when these test =
windows are. What are the functional tests that they need to do for =
processes. What are the system, you know, the UATs that need, well, I =
should say functional UAT that it needs to run and talk to each other about=
 where are the test scripts, etc. So what is probably needed. One of the =
things that we should add into our talk about for the you can open the deck=
 and we'll talk through it is we need, I think you've mentioned something =
around the test scripts, but we need an IT work stream versus function =
conversation that we need to calendar and we need to talk to peers about =
that. So we need to calendar between, say it, you know, ERP and supply =
chain or data and analytics and supply chain. So all of it and supply chain=
 to and similarly other functions to talk through. Here are windows for =
testing. Here are the systems we're testing. Here's the information we need=
. Here are the test scripts. So I think we need a calendar of, for lack of =
a better word here, MOS this week and next to set up individual connects =
between IT and the functions to get all of that down. All of that again =
flows into the dashboard you have. Because when we say things around is sit=
 ready, is is KT other people identified, are the testers identified as =
knowledge transfer complete, is UAT test scripts ready? Are they developed?=
 All that stuff is in your tracker. I think we need to add that stuff in =
here as part of the dashboarding and the maybe the heat map, maybe not, but=
 certainly the dashboard.

4:54
Yeah, certainly.

4:56
Let's go through what you have and in the context of what I just mentioned,=
 let's see how we can quickly modify these slides so that when we talk to =
Pierce, we know he's looking essentially. You've seen some of the emails.

5:10
Yeah.

5:11
So, you know, I'm making sure I copy you on all the emails=
, but yeah, you can see how his thinking is. But okay, so standing up brv, =
I would. So a couple of things Here, the 82 systems, where did you get that=
 from?

5:29
It was mentioned on some call, but it might have been =
hypothetical.

5:33
No, no. So what's happening is. And there is a number =
if you look at one of the slides. There are about 10 applications that are =
not. So I would say. So I would say BRV go live is. And you should say =
about. About 22 systems. So that's fine. BRV Go Live is in. Is the first of=
 August. You could say approximately 22 systems need to be. Yeah. Need to =
complete UAT, you know, obviously in advance by mid July. That's fine. We =
should also say. Yeah, the second statement's redundant. You could take =
that. We should also say there are 10 non BRV systems going live before =
July or. Yeah, by July and another 50 plus 52 actually going live between =
August and October. Let's say by September. Between August and September. =
And then. So we're standing up an engine and hypercare war room leadership =
can see progress. That every Friday call, I think is just more of an =
executive leadership that Jeff and Sukai kind of initiated. I think it will=
 move into a different cadence. What we should do is say instead leave that=
 there for now. Let's, let's. Let's reword that and say few things. I'm =
just thinking out loud here.

7:43
Yeah.

7:45
We have to develop a =
dashboard by Friday. I think we should maybe let's say something to the =
effect of. Leadership is looking for current readiness, SIT and readiness. =
UAT readiness status. So Leadership is looking for. Yeah, current SIT and =
UAT readiness status.

8:13
Can we say something about like the. I think =
the theme that keeps coming up that you mentioned is someone said it really=
 well on the ISC call earlier that within the work streams they're very =
good, but coordinating across them is I think, where the gap is. And Pierce=
 has said that. And that's I think to your point down here with like the =
calendarizing mosque, that's one of the main focuses for us is getting a =
plan and coordinating across all of these functions. The testing, the =
windows, the script, preparedness, et cetera. Across all of the functions =
who independently are executing uat probably. Well, it's just a coordinate,=
 not as.

8:55
An end to end.

8:56
Yeah, exactly.

8:57
Okay, so let's reword that. I think I understand. So then let's say =
something effective is leadership is looking for an end to end status. On. =
I want to include the words you mentioned. So whether it's coordination or =
maybe say leadership is expecting end to end coordination and reporting.

9:35
Yeah, exactly.

9:38
On readiness across all it. I know end to end, =
it's probably redundant. But we say leadership expecting end to end =
coordination and reporting on readiness across all IT work streams. So =
let's see. So what we're building this week, I want to see if I can add one=
 more.

10:11
This is like the general one. So I just added this piece per =
your comment earlier about like calendarized mos to drive the I functional =
alignment. This is like that general things that we're doing.

10:23
So maybe then also the background should be functions. We should also say =
functions are looking at. Well maybe the second bullet is before leadership=
. We say functions are looking at or functions are expecting it to partner =
with them on readiness activities and requirements. On requirements and =
readiness requirements in the sense functional requirements for testing the=
 test scenarios. All those things. So functions are expecting it to partner=
. Yeah. To on. On test scenario development and testing coordination. Right=
. And then leadership expecting end to end coordination reporting and =
readiness across all IT work streams. We can come back to it. I think let's=
 leave it for now. I think if we can get it more succinct we will. Okay, =
let's look at what we're building this week and those numbers, it'll also =
have to change because those numbers you have there will change once we do =
this alignment.

11:47
Yeah, exactly.

11:48
So you know the point we said =
earlier 40 something actually. Well yeah. So one thing I'd like to add is =
on Friday call, you know, Chris Sukai said, hey, I need a view of what is =
in readiness. So I want to add something to that effect of it's not just =
leadership expecting end to end coordination. Maybe just say leadership =
expecting end to end coordination and you know, end to end coordination =
comma reporting and current status. And we can voice over that in essence =
that Sukai saying oh, I didn't know 42 systems are in sit. I want to get a =
review of it for leadership readout, etc. Maybe you can add starting =
starting 65 or something you know, at the end of it, you know across all =
work streams. Starting six six. Yeah. So let's see what are we building =
this week? So actually we should have which should say four in a box roster=
. So it's not upset lead. I would say, I would say functional lead. So =
you've got. Yeah, I'd say function lead.

13:43
What about the coordinator?

13:46
Yeah, I think we could say.

13:51
So in the next one I, I added =
this piece over here about like the opset lead. They're like each person's =
like primary role in that.

14:02
So opsep is more like they're all decided=
. So like Paul is the operational separation lead for the program. All =
those people are known. It's more finance. I have somebody as a coordinator=
 for finance but I've got sub functions in finance and then I've got it so =
I've got. Within it, I've got sub functions in supply chain or sub work =
streams in supply chain. So it's really. The four in a box is. So let's go =
back and say. Let's see what that four in a box is. So you could say, =
actually the four in a box is. I would say Honeywell. Let's say uat. Oh, =
it's a bit more than four in a box. But let's put the first bullet as =
functional lead. So Honeywell and Athens, functional lead. All right. Han =
and Solstice. Yeah. Han and at. Functional leads. Han and actually function=
, sub function leads. And then comma, hon and Athens, it Function sub, =
function leads. So that would be the four. And then you could add. The =
second one is you should also then add. So let's see. In fact, instead of =
just saying roster, just say for. Instead of saying for in a box roster, =
just say UAT roster. Because I want to also call it as the second bullet =
there. The. The coordinators. The UAT coordinators, test leads and testers.=
 UAT coordinators are known. Pierce and his counterpart, Sriram, the guy =
that spoke up today, test leads for each of these sub functions. We don't =
know. And then any testers you know, we don't know. So.

16:40
So I am wondering if we can take this here, put it here, and then use.

16:48
Will be one. Yeah.

16:49
And then use this box to describe, like, =
what is the UAT roster Like. Like, keep this as the. Like, what's the point=
 of the UAT roster? Yeah, a description. And then I'll take these and stick=
 these. This overwrites this.

17:06
Sure. And then we'll have to make sure=
 we track that here on your table.

17:10
Exactly.

17:11
So the titles will be fine. Yeah, we'll change. I mean, not fine, we'll =
have to change the title. But let's go back there then. So let's go back to=
 slide one. We'll say something to the effect of finalize. Actually, don't =
delete. I'll just say, yeah, maybe. Yeah. Let's say finalize technical and =
functional owners and leads. And maybe you can even call it finalize four =
in a box, meaning it's the more four in a box of function leads, etc. So =
maybe that's the first one. Finalize four in a box. The rest one. No, the =
next one is second bullet is finalize, Identify, testing, identify =
technical and functional owners, test owners and leads. Or the second =
bullet will be Identify technical and, you know, actually flip that. =
Identify functional and technical, test lead owners and test leads. Owners =
and test leads.

18:44
Yeah.

18:46
And then you could kill the others. The=
 other two bullets below. But finalize the four in a box. I'm thinking we =
should call out as. Yeah, maybe we say finalize four in a box. Governance =
only from the context of. Okay. They decide, you know, within this function=
, there are three, four finance people. And they decide, perhaps, you know,=
 how within that work stream, they'll decide how, you know, these things =
work.

19:29
Exactly. Well, I mean, this. Ultimately, I want to write this =
after. Because the 400 box governance is what drives the IT functional =
alignment ultimately. Or what we will use to drive it.

19:41
Right. So let's look at the entry readiness prep. I wouldn't. So the black.=
 You're saying the owners are function leads for this?

19:49
Yeah, yeah. Like who's. Like, mainly responsible? And we can delete these =
if you don't think that it adds anything.

19:56
It won't be. It won't be. =
It's. It's. We won't. It'll be both. So. Yeah. And we can maybe voiceover =
or, you know, so. Okay. UAT entry readiness prep. June 13th. Light touch. =
UAD sign off. I wouldn't call it that. I don't think we have exact numbers =
of June 13th. For example, ERP is already saying there's a June. There's =
probably like a 13th to 23rd window or 23rd. So supply chain's got a =
different window. Supply chain sit team has got. Supply chain has got a =
different SIT window. So leave that June 13th off. What do you mean by =
entry readiness prep?

20:42
This is like the generic box. This is like the=
. Like the. Any other coordination that we're doing. So like calendarize =
mos. So let's hear the plan.

20:57
Let's. Let's put that as first. So =
calendarize mos. You know, maybe we say, you know, we. We know this is for =
acting this week, but Calendarize.

21:06
Yeah.

21:07
Or. Yeah, this is like the plan for the functional alignment.

21:12
Functional alignment. Because this was the thing.

21:14
Yeah, that's fine.

21:15
Siri. Siri.

21:16
Ron. Sri Rom.

21:18
Sri Rom. Yes. Had asked for =
kind of by the end of the week was like a. The plan for.

21:25
You said. Yeah.

21:27
What for mos?

21:30
No, just say. I just say set up=
 mos. Right. Or finalize. You know, finalize mo. Just set up MOS is good. =
Actually do set up Daily Mosquito. I would say develop tracker. Develop =
dash. Develop dashboard and tracker. I would say. So the other stuff on =
June 13, light touch.

22:12
You can get rid of those.

22:14
That one's fine. Yeah. Remove that one, I would say then, you know, =
finalize logistics develop, you know. Yeah. Finalize logistics. So the =
other piece of this is for readiness. We're going to have to talk about =
where is this being done? You know, is it in a room somewhere? People come =
in and test. Are they going to get laptops and credentials? How do you =
provide access to these apps for them? All this other stuff, what logins =
will they use? You know, do they. Do they come in and run? Who signs? So =
logistics, tactical executions. Fine. So UAT roster. Finalize foreign box =
governance. Identify functional technical owners and test leads. So set up =
daily mosquito. I would say developer readiness dashboard and reporting =
tracker. Okay. You already have the executive dashboard on the right. So =
entry readiness prep. Okay. Remove the readiness that. Remove the. Develop =
that one and move it into the other one. Remove the second bullet. Let's =
move it to the right. Just call it develop weekly Friday reporting.

23:49
This can go away.

23:52
Yeah. More so because that's. That's executive =
reporting. So remove that. Yeah. Delete that. I want to say something to =
the effect of.

readiness and testing coordination for an upcoming business transformation,=
 specifically focusing on UAT (User Acceptance Testing), cross-functional =
alignment, and dashboard/reporting requirements.</p>
<hr />
<p>Main Topics Discussed</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold"=
>Personal Updates &amp; Setting the Stage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both participants exchange brief updates about their weekends, which =
included a wedding and extensive travel for connecting flights to Dallas.=
</li>
<li>The call shifts quickly to a dashboard review for a =
transformation/testing program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Background: Workshop &amp; Current =
Status</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop held on May 15th in Charlotte scoped =
changes in processes, subprocesses, and systems, with a focus on impacts to=
 supply chain, procurement, and IT (including legal entity updates in ERP).=
</li>
<li>PMO produced a deck (located in the UAT folder) summarizing =
process changes and mapping systems, data flows, and testing requirements.=
</li>
<li>Key Outcomes:<ul>
<li>Supply chain and procurement are =
significantly impacted and are leading related system/process cutovers.=
</li>
<li>IT faces notable change due to legal entity adjustments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Testing =
&amp; Coordination Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large number of =
systems and processes require testing and alignment.<ul>
<li>Approximately 22 systems need to complete UAT for BRV Go Live scheduled=
 for August 1, 2025.</li>
<li>10 non-BRV systems will go live before July.=
</li>
<li>Additional 52 systems are scheduled for Go Live between August =
and September.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Main concern: misalignment between =
IT/system testing and functional/process testing windows.</li>
<li>Need to strengthen the connection between IT and functional teams (e.g.=
, ERP, supply chain, data/analytics) for calendarizing testing, sharing =
test scripts, and ensuring required data/info is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Dashboard &amp; Reporting =
Needs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership (including Jeff and Sukai) is =
demanding clear and up-to-date readiness status, covering SIT (System =
Integration Testing) and UAT.<ul>
<li>Dashboard must include SIT/UAT =
readiness, tester identification, knowledge transfer, test script =
completion, and possible addition of a heat map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus is on end-to-end status reporting, not just siloed work-streams.=
</li>
<li>Functions expect IT to be closely partnered on test scenario =
development and coordination.</li>
<li>There needs to be executive =
visibility into all workstreams and their current readiness, beginning June=
 6.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Governance =
Structure: &#39;Four in a Box&#39; &amp; UAT Roster</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;Four in a Box&#39; model discussed as a way to assure proper =
cross-functional representation and governance:<ul>
<li>Composed of functional leads, sub-functional leads, IT leads, and =
sub-functional IT leads (from both Honeywell and Athens).</li>
<li>UAT roster should also include UAT coordinators, test leads, and =
testers.</li>
<li>Some roles (i.e., test leads and testers) are yet to be =
identified for all sub-functions and systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UAT roster and governance structures need to be finalized and used to =
drive IT-functional alignment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Immediate Action Items &amp; Next =
Steps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a comprehensive dashboard by Friday (by=
 June 6, 2025) for leadership reporting.</li>
<li>Calendarize and set up =
alignment meetings (MOS - Management Operating System connects) between IT =
workstreams and functional teams within this and next week.</li>
<li>Finalize the &#39;Four in a Box&#39; structure/governance and identify =
all relevant functional and technical test owners and leads.</li>
<li>Develop and maintain UAT rosters and logistics (including workspace, =
credentials, access).</li>
<li>Remove or adjust specific date references (e=
.g., June 13 for readiness prep) due to variability in workstream testing =
windows.</li>
<li>Prepare and adapt executive reporting slides based on =
evolving numbers/roles as alignment progresses.</li>
<li>Track and report progress in standing executive calls (currently =
Fridays, cadence may shift).</li>

And I want to make sure. So you heard a couple of these things. Piping up =
on the call with it. So what&#x27;s happening is to bring you up to speed, =
we had this workshop on the 15th where we laid out this whole. And I think =
you may have a view into that deck. It&#x27;s in the UAT folder. So PMO put=
 together all these processes, what&#x27;s changing? And then a view of =
what are the systems, what are the data flows. Well, more so processes and =
sub processes, what&#x27;s changing, what are the systems that it&#x27;s =
touching, what is the data that&#x27;s needed, what environment, et cetera.=
 So we had a whole day workshop in Charlotte and coming out of it, it was =
clear that supply chain, for example, a lot of what you saw now and heard =
on this call, this purchase order, sales order cutover, it&#x27;s all =
supply chain LED and procurement led. And it&#x27;s going to impact from an=
 IT perspective. IT impacts, you know, the whatever legal entity changes =
they&#x27;re doing. Well, I guess it flows down into, based on the LE =
changes that are needed in the erp that is a little bit above market level,=
 if you will, or maybe it&#x27;s a bit more of a market level to say, okay,=
 that&#x27;s all legal entity related changes. Rob and our EY team are =
putting together this whole cutover strategy and they&#x27;ll stand up a =
command center and they&#x27;ll talk through some of that stuff that Jeff =
was rambling about. On Friday on. Okay, we need a hypercare. We need this =
model, that model. This all bakes into that for the purposes of what we =
need to do with peers. One of the outcomes of that workshop was, listen, =
I&#x27;ve got a crapload of systems that are getting tested. I&#x27;ve also=
 got a crapload of processes that the functions need to change and test. =
There needs to be some alignment between when these test windows are. What =
are the functional tests that they need to do for processes. What are the =
system, you know, the UATs that need, well, I should say functional UAT =
that it needs to run and talk to each other about where are the test =
scripts, etc. So what is probably needed. One of the things that we should =
add into our talk about for the you can open the deck and we&#x27;ll talk =
through it is we need, I think you&#x27;ve mentioned something around the =
test scripts, but we need an IT work stream versus function conversation =
that we need to calendar and we need to talk to peers about that. So we =
need to calendar between, say it, you know, ERP and supply chain or data =
and analytics and supply chain. So all of it and supply chain to and =
similarly other functions to talk through. Here are windows for testing. =
Here are the systems we&#x27;re testing. Here&#x27;s the information we =
need. Here are the test scripts. So I think we need a calendar of, for lack=
 of a better word here, MOS this week and next to set up individual =
connects between IT and the functions to get all of that down. All of that =
again flows into the dashboard you have. Because when we say things around =
is sit ready, is is KT other people identified, are the testers identified =
as knowledge transfer complete, is UAT test scripts ready? Are they =
developed? All that stuff is in your tracker. I think we need to add that =
stuff in here as part of the dashboarding and the maybe the heat map, maybe=
 not, but certainly the dashboard.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:1=

 So what&#x27;s happening is. And there is a number if you look at one of =
the slides. There are about 10 applications that are not. So I would say. =
So I would say BRV go live is. And you should say about. About 22 systems. =
So that&#x27;s fine. BRV Go Live is in. Is the first of August. You could =
say approximately 22 systems need to be. Yeah. Need to complete UAT, you =
know, obviously in advance by mid July. That&#x27;s fine. We should also =
say. Yeah, the second statement&#x27;s redundant. You could take that. We =
should also say there are 10 non BRV systems going live before July or. =
Yeah, by July and another 50 plus 52 actually going live between August and=
 October. Let&#x27;s say by September. Between August and September. And =
then. So we&#x27;re standing up an engine and hypercare war room leadership=
 can see progress. That every Friday call, I think is just more of an =
executive leadership that Jeff and Sukai kind of initiated. I think it will=
 move into a different cadence. What we should do is say instead leave that=
 there for now. Let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s. Let&#x27;s reword that and say few =

requirements in the sense functional requirements for testing the test =

said, hey, I need a view of what is in readiness. So I want to add =
something to that effect of it&#x27;s not just leadership expecting end to =
end coordination. Maybe just say leadership expecting end to end =
coordination and you know, end to end coordination comma reporting and =
current status. And we can voice over that in essence that Sukai saying oh,=
 I didn&#x27;t know 42 systems are in sit. I want to get a review of it for=
 leadership readout, etc. Maybe you can add starting starting 65 or =
something you know, at the end of it, you know across all work streams. =
Starting six six. Yeah. So let&#x27;s see what are we building this week? =
So actually we should have which should say four in a box roster. So =
it&#x27;s not upset lead. I would say, I would say functional lead. So =
you&#x27;ve got. Yeah, I&#x27;d say function lead.</div></div><div =

opsep is more like they&#x27;re all decided. So like Paul is the =
operational separation lead for the program. All those people are known. =
It&#x27;s more finance. I have somebody as a coordinator for finance but =
I&#x27;ve got sub functions in finance and then I&#x27;ve got it so =
I&#x27;ve got. Within it, I&#x27;ve got sub functions in supply chain or =
sub work streams in supply chain. So it&#x27;s really. The four in a box is=
. So let&#x27;s go back and say. Let&#x27;s see what that four in a box is.=
 So you could say, actually the four in a box is. I would say Honeywell. =
Let&#x27;s say uat. Oh, it&#x27;s a bit more than four in a box. But =
let&#x27;s put the first bullet as functional lead. So Honeywell and Athens=
, functional lead. All right. Han and Solstice. Yeah. Han and at. =
Functional leads. Han and actually function, sub function leads. And then =
comma, hon and Athens, it Function sub, function leads. So that would be =
the four. And then you could add. The second one is you should also then =
add. So let&#x27;s see. In fact, instead of just saying roster, just say =
for. Instead of saying for in a box roster, just say UAT roster. Because I =
want to also call it as the second bullet there. The. The coordinators. The=
 UAT coordinators, test leads and testers. UAT coordinators are known. =
Pierce and his counterpart, Sriram, the guy that spoke up today, test leads=
 for each of these sub functions. We don&#x27;t know. And then any testers =
