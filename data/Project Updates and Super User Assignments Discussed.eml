Transcript:
1:20
A couple more minutes for Adam to join, that's =
who. And Prashant, I believe, both accepted.

1:29
Was Rachel Gallagher =
invited to this meeting?

1:32
She was, but she said she's out of office =
today and tomorrow. Is that correct?

1:37
That sounds right. Now that. Now=
 that you say that, yes, that sounds right.

1:40
Okay. Just wanted to make=
 sure.

1:46
As I say, I thought Rachel had done the majority of the work =
in the spreadsheet. When she told me on. When we talked on Tuesday, I think=
 there were a few questions that she had for resources outside of Rockford.=
 There's quite a few lines on the spreadsheet that we don't touch. So there=
 are some questions that need to be asked of a Getci employee. There's also=
 some pieces that we need a Wolverhampton person to answer a question. I =
believe that's James Goodchild. But we had entered that information into =
the sheet, so need to understand what additional information you're looking=
 for from us.

2:47
And maybe if we pull that sheet.

2:49
Up.

2:52
Rachel, we could highlight those gaps. Nick, I know that you have an agenda=
 for this call and I don't want to derail you, but I think that for =
Wolverhampton. Todd, correct me if I'm wrong, we did some outreach before. =
I think that only had. Might have been Poland, actually. They had one =
project hosted in Rockford and they didn't need access. What was the. What =
was driving the Wolverhampton question?

3:20
Amanda, let me find the =
spreadsheet here because I think that would just be the fastest.

3:26
Yeah, you can drop a link or share.

3:28
I think that was that Matt Hannah=
. I believe that was the might.

3:33
Sorry, yeah, I need to go back and =
check. But it was Matt Hanna, remember if it was Poland or Rockford or =
Poland or Wolverhampton that he was talking about. But give me one second =
and I will go check.

3:51
I think he was uk. Yeah, he was uk.

3:53
Yeah. Okay, that's what I thought. So UK only has one project and that's =
the Team center one. So UK only has one project and that's the team center =
and that's actuation only. So the only action there will be to remove the =
Collins user. User access from that. And then Poland has like one person =
that uses it. And I think they had a project in the us, Rockford instance, =
but they don't need it going forward. I don't think that they need access. =
So it's just that one team Center, Wolverhampton one. And I think that =
we've done the diligence and can confirm that it's actuation only. I'm just=
 trying to pull up that link that was shared.

4:47
I'm sharing my screen. Mac does that. Do you want me to drive?

4:51
Yeah, sure. Amanda, is this the one?

4:56
No sir. I need the complexity, =
disposition and work item count sheet. I don't believe there was anything =
actually to do in this sheet.

5:06
If you go over to click a Rockford =
instance on the bottom left there, I think that that's what this.

5:13
There it is. Okay, thank you. So that's already been sorted. So we've =
identified 451-2345. So one of our instances isn't showing up on the list. =
That Belfara CP piece, line 114. Line 114 didn't show up on the other =
spreadsheet. So we added it for most of the other stuff. I guess that first=
 row is the best example. When I was saying that we don't use the instance.=
 The test equipment ALM Bularian database. We opened it, we put one thing =
in it, we're done. Never opened it since. So the majority of these don't =
have anything useful to us. Now the rest of these. So ask Shankar at GT gc.=
 We don't know what they're doing with their ALM stuff but that's not us. =
So I have no one in Rockford who can answer those questions. So that's, =
that's that piece and then same thing for some of those other ones. Row 112=
 is a good example. Actuation. Rockford was never worked on primary =
aircraft. So actuation was split in between what we call the big airplanes,=
 right? 767, 737. The heavies and Rockford did the secondary class, the =
business jets. So row 112 there is primaries. That's wolves. That's not us =
or someone you know. Wolverhampton related. The other ones are probably =
Collins owned and operated. Collins Tech Alerts, the product safety Office,=
 Collins Team center, plm. We don't need any of those. But they're not ours=
. So we're not sure if we should make that call or not. The only other one.=
 So the first three unabashedly actuation. The Belfar SCP, that's for sure =
us. That row 114 there, that's for sure us. We. We. That needs to go. We =
don't think there's anything in those that we're really using. The only =
item of interest here is going to be row 464 which is the MC21. High lift. =
Whatever EM is that guy. Now that guy is a problem. He's a problem on two =
fronts. One, he belongs to Bangalore. Well the work is being done by =
Bangalore engineers. Okay. However, this is a Russian aircraft and so the =
data for the Russian aircraft must remain in the United States per the =
license agreement. So that's how Rockford inherited that particular piece. =
So the management and the access to that database is granted by Rachel, I =
think, and myself. Honestly, we have to grant them access to that on a =
limited basis because we inherited it from Phoenix. But it is my =
understanding that that particular piece of information must stay on the =
United States or in the United States. It cannot be managed on a European =
server and it certainly cannot be managed by an Indian server. The rest of =
everything in there Rachel and I had identified as probably not belonging =
to Rockford specifically and could be let go without repercussions for day =
one. Does that make sense?

9:07
Yeah.

9:08
Okay.

9:10
We'Re looking at five total, is that correct?

9:15
Yeah, four and a half. I'm not sure what to call that MC21 one. But yes, =
five specific ones.

9:23
If it makes you feel any better, there's Doors =
data that's the same way for.

9:26
Oh Yeah, I bet.

9:27
21.

9:27
So I bet.

9:29
Sorry, go ahead.

9:32
No, go for it.

9:33
I mean I was just going to ask for that MC21 one. If Bangalore is doing the=
 work after day one, who is going to be doing the work? Like does actuation=
. Do you need a copy of that project? I assume that you do. It's like it's =
actuation project. Bangalore's doing the work. Right. So you need a copy of=
 that project.

9:58
That would be my guess. Now I'm. I'm obviously not on =
the actuation program management side of the house anymore. Thank God. So =
we need to find someone in Bangalore who can tell you if that project is =
going with them. Are they done working on it? Have they finished? Have they=
 started? What are they doing? That's the part that we just. We don't know.=
 So because we aren't. We Rockford are not involved in that project =
whatsoever. I can't even tell you who is working on that. I'm just going to=
 direct you to Mohan, Kumar and Kamaraya and hope that he knows otherwise.

10:41
Yeah, okay. Yeah. We have similar cadence with Mohan and Shankar. =
Similar to this one. We at some point were probably going to combine these =
calls because we're actively working on the same thing. Just separate =
instances. They have already gotten through this process of deciding which =
projects are in scope or not. And so I think that that is what we had =
talked about holding off until. But it would be helpful to get with Mohan =
and Nick. We can just make a note that that will probably be our follow up =
for the Bangalore Weekly or bi weekly cadence to talk through that app =
because I know that that came up in our conversation Rachel yesterday with =
Rachel Gallagher as well. And so I think that we need to ask them are they =
done with the work? Is it still an open project? And then what type of data=
 is in there? And someone needs to make that decision about whether or not =
a copy gets made and where it gets stored and so on and so forth. So we can=
 put that one to bed. And then I think these other ones make sense. Is =
there anything, what is the filter that's applied on this sheet? Is there =
anything else? 1. I just want to make sure that we're not missing anything =
and thank you Amanda so much for adding that that project. Do we feel =
confident that we have captured all of the projects that are important with=
 this Four and a half.

12:13
So the answer there is truly the only one =
that's actually. Oh, and I'm going to catch flack for this but truly the =
only one that's actively being used by an actuation employee is the MC21 =
high lift. Right. The Bangalore folks, they liked ALM, they got into it, =
they're using it on a daily basis. The other four were opened and I believe=
 there's stuff in there. Right? There's 13 files, 193 files. We move stuff =
in there. Are any of those four being used on a day to day basis? No sir. =
Have they been used in the last six to 18 months? No sir. Would any of them=
 have been opened and used in the last 24 to 36 months? Now that's more of =
a maybe. So is there information that is critical for day one for those =
first three? We don't think so. We think the what's in. We don't have =
access obviously, but we believe that what was loaded into those folders is=
 duplicated in some other location. We just, you know, opened it to use the=
 tool. Now that Belfara cp, I cannot make the same guarantee that might =
actually have stuff in it. We had started BELFARA about when they showed us=
 alm. I don't believe there's anything useful in there. I don't believe =
it's anything we're actively working on. So to the previous question about =
needing to test, you know, links and active links to workbooks and whatnot =
within the database. None of those four would still need that activity. =
Testing, making sure stuff works. I do not believe there is sufficient day =
to day use of those four databases.

14:13
That's great news.

14:15
Can I ask a Quick question. Yeah, Amanda. So Amanda, would you be more =
familiar with the Actuations users or the Collins users?

14:28
Depends on what it is.

14:31
Okay. Because we do have an ask around =
identifying super users. And so, you know, I was just curious if you would =
be the right person to help us identify super users on either the actuation=
 side or the column side of the house.

14:54
I don't. Crandall, can you =
remember did we ever get to a point where we had super users other than =
nategov? Did anybody have that kind of access? I honestly don't remember.

15:06
Not that I'm aware of.

15:08
Okay, same. When I say we didn't use it=
, I really mean we didn't use it. I don't know how many times I can express=
 that. So from a super user standpoint, I honestly don't think there is =
going to be a quote unquote super user identified for Rockford actuation =
purposes. We just didn't use the tool flat out. From the Collins side. It =
all belongs to nategov or whoever owns ALM these days. So if it's a Collins=
 ALM management obviously goes up to somebody at corporate, so on and so =
forth. So there are individual pieces now I can tell you. I guess maybe the=
 best example. So row 114 there, that's Sheehan, the software manager. The =
ex software manager for actuation. She doesn't work for Actuation anymore, =
she works for Collins. Could she tell you what's in there? Maybe. Is she a =
super user? No sir. No, I don't believe that I would identify anyone =
currently in. If Adam Crandall is not your actuation super user, I don't =
believe I have a resource identified for that purpose.

16:30
Yeah, essentially we're just looking for somebody that would be able to say=
 I'm gonna look at a project and just make sure the people that do have =
access is the appropriate list. Right. Just to make sure that when it comes=
 to day one, there's no people from columns that are getting access to any =
of these actuations projects.

16:48
Is that me? As the whatever my title =
is supposed to be now I can make that for those top four projects. I can =
make that determination and say this is Collins, this is actuation. Rebecca=
 no longer needs access to the Collins or to the the actuation Belfast cp.

17:10
Yeah.

17:11
Okay, so we can provide you instructions with how to go =
into the tool and say yep, no, these people don't need to be in there, =
we'll remove them, whatever, right?

17:19
Yes, absolutely.

17:20
Okay.

17:23
Go ahead.

17:24
No, I'll just answer. Amanda, you would be removing =
the Actuations folks from Collins Only projects.

17:33
Okay, that makes sense.

17:35
Just wanted to clarify that. Okay. And then =
it sounded like Nate Gove would be the person removing Collins people from =
actuations projects.

17:47
He's gonna kill me. Potentially. Maybe I would =
reach out to Nate as a person to start with. I don't know that he owns =
every ALM project. I do believe he is my. I'm going to call him a point of =
contact. If it breaks, I'm going to call Nate and say, hey, Polarian isn't =
doing what I expected to do. He is the person in Rockford I would contact. =
However, I would caution that not all of the databases listed there belong =
to Rockford. Some. Some are quite, quite a bit higher. I don't believe =
there are any that would be. Be specific to Nate. They're going to be =
corporate or Bangalore, that kind of thing. So he might be able to help. He=
 would be the only quote, unquote, super user I could think of.

18:40
Yeah, that's just real quick, Rachel. If you want to filter on superuser =
just in that column. And I think we should go back to the actual =
spreadsheet. So I don't want to spend too much time on this. But we did =
want to try to answer this question during this call. But so what you're =
seeing on the screen right now, Amanda, Adam, are some tasks we have for =
the execution phase. So basically just a few weeks from now, what we want =
to do is we want to remove columns users and remove actuations users from =
projects where it's actuations only or columns only, respectively. Right. =
The person who can take that action is the super user. And so we need to =
identify who that super user is for actuations and for Collins so they can =
remove the other side from their projects.

19:34
So you're talking about =
within the tool itself. Yes, ma'am. I would start with. So that's =
definitely not me. And there is.

19:44
It might be Mohammed, which =
Muhammad, Rachel. We had him on this call at the very beginning. I think =
that he is. When we've spoken with Nate Gove, Nate directed us to him.

20:00
You talking about Mohammad?

20:02
Yes, Mohammad.

20:03
Well, but he, he again, he's a. He's a server admin. So he wouldn't =
actually know the projects.

20:09
Right. That's fair.

20:17
And what we were hoping to do is to expedite our timeline by not requiring =
Bruce Cohen to do. Do it for each of these. Not only does he. Because he =
would then need the list of users because he doesn't know the projects =
either. So our thesis was the super user knows the projects, they know the =
people and they can remove access based on the disposition.

20:46
Yeah, but they would have to know the tool is what you're saying, right?

20:49
It seems like the gap is that they, you know, we won't have the =
people in the tool who can, can do this.

21:05
I would say that Bangalore =
does have a super user. Someone at Bangalore is able to add actuation folks=
 to projects and create them. But Outlook would have eaten whoever that was=
 many, many moons ago. I don't think I have that email anymore. But I want =
to say that someone in Bangalore does that because they would have created =
the projects for Rockford. I do not believe we participated in the physical=
 creation of the projects for Rockford.

21:49
I don't want to get over my =
skis but would we be able to promote you, Amanda and you Adam as super =
users?

22:00
I would be happy to take that on but there's going to be a =
little bit of a ramp up while somebody shows me how to open ALM because =
I've never done that part so I don't think it would be a expedient =
methodology. I would however be very happy to shoulder surf if someone else=
 has tool access. I would be more than happy to sit with someone and say, =
oh nope, not that guy, not that guy, not that guy. Which I believe is the =
extent of what we're trying to do here.

22:35
Yeah, I think that's exactly=
 right. And our gap is we don't have one person who's both sides of the =
brain, if you will. Todd, Rachel, does that work for both of you? I mean we=
 have to I guess now identify someone in the tool who can remove access and=
 then link that person with Amanda. But I guess it has. We'd need one for =
Rockford and one for Bangalore or I don't know Mac, if you have a, a =
thought on that. Either.

23:15
I think you're on the right track.

23:18
Good, go ahead Mac.

23:20
No, I just said I think you're on the right =
track.

23:22
Yeah, I agree. And I'm guessing Bruce and Mohan, those guys =
could probably do a lot of those. Right?

23:31
So, so we're saying we want=
 Bruce to. Because. Because that's what Bruce wants. Bruce said I need to =
know who the users are and you know that that sounds like it would come =
from Amanda and he could just do it. So I don't, and you know, I don't know=
 Amanda, if we could get you an extract and you do it offline and we ship =
it to Bruce. But I, I don't know the tool either. So I Can't. I can't =
promise I can get you an extract.

23:56
I. I would imagine that if it was =
anything like Doors. Excuse me. And I imagine or like the Simon's PLM team =
Center portion. If PLM is similar to alm, then people are added in groups =
and we can just get the list of groups and the people who are parts of =
those groups and then identify the actuation resources fairly quickly that =
way. I think if it's not, then it's a very tedious over the shoulder =
reading somebody else's screen, but it is, it would have been possible to =
do an offline thing for plm, so I'm assuming we can do it for alm, but =
again we need to find somebody who actually can open the tool and tell us =
whether that's the truth or not.

24:46
Yeah. And that's where Mac I think =
was doing kind of the Polarian magic for us. And so yeah, I'd say it's =
probably more steps than, than a simple export. Unless, correct me if I'm =
wrong, Mac.

25:03
Yeah, I. I don't know if I can speak to that. I was. =
Nate gave me access to poke around but I'm not sure just how involved of a =
process it is. It doesn't seem hard, but I think that like these projects =
vary, right? Like the ALM ones where we're just using Subversion as a =
repository versus the ones where folks are actually going in and using =
Polarian itself. I'm not sure how it will work, but I'm confident that it's=
 possible. I just don't know how involved it is. Nick, we could probably =
get together and I can just show you what I have and what I can get and =
come to a determination.

25:47
Could I ask a question?

25:49
Yeah.

25:51
The sheet that we asked for that Rachel had sent out a link to was the says=
 rockford polarian user 2 project something or other.

26:05
User project mapping.

26:07
Yes. That has the actuation users of those =
projects specifically listed. So the only person who has access to the APS =
test equipment project is Jacob Gregg. Does Jacob Gregg belong to Actuation=
? Yes. Done. Can we just use that list and give that like it needs to be =
modified a little bit. But if those are the actuation identified employees,=
 can we just give that list to someone and say please remove these folks?

26:42
Yeah, I think as long as it's validated then yeah.

26:51
Sounds like a place to start. Yeah.

26:55
And so I guess Amanda, if you, =
if you call that your extract, we'll go from there and. And Mac. Yeah, you =
know, I think Mac did some of the data Updating and mapping on that piece. =
And so, you know, if he's given us a thumbs up, then I think that's your =
extract. And if you validate those people, then we can give that list to =
Bruce or Mohan.

27:19
Okay. I think the easiest way then would be to take =
the, the list that Rachel and I put together here and where there is a =
column in this project mapping spreadsheet, this is assessment Gov. Perhaps=
 I'll just add a column that says, you know, Collins actuation. Collins =
actuation. We don't know all those good things. So I will move the =
information that we put into the assessment spreadsheet into the project =
mapping spreadsheet. And I think that gets us one more step closer to =
having a formal list that can go to your super user position.

27:59
I see, so you're saying add the column, update the pivot table and then =
it's a little more robust.

28:05
But I believe that should answer. Be able=
 to answer most of the questions they would have for us. Yes.

28:12
Gotcha. Okay, Rachel, can you jump back to the. The other doc you were =
sharing? So I think one question I had and sorry, just from the agenda and =
I know we're at time, so. Amanda, Adam, can y'all stay on for maybe five or=
 ten minutes longer?

28:32
I can, yes.

28:35
Was just the status of these=
 dispositions. And so I see there's a lot of follow ups in column E, which =
I think is the column you're going to transport, right?

28:47
Yes.

28:48
When do we think we can have this completely done? Because our timeline was=
 tomorrow. If we need more time. Okay. But we just have to confirm because =
our deadline to lock in our project plan is tomorrow.

29:06
I think tomorrow was an unreasonable expectation from the beginning.

29:10
No worries. That's completely, it's completely valid. We want that feedback=
.

29:16
My concern is, is that we would. That we would need to confirm. So=
 all of these pieces that don't belong to us from an actuation or a Colin =
standpoint, that's one clock. All of these. Ask UK or ask Shankar. I will =
get with Rachel and double check who these people are and so we can start =
to talk to them for the, for the Bangalore ones. Did you guys want to ask =
Shankar? Should I just reach out to Mohan? What would be the easiest =
methodology there?

30:01
I don't see our next call with that team. I think=
 we were thinking about combining these calls, so I do think it makes sense=
 to make that bridge now. I don't see the separate call though. Rachel.

30:13
Tuesday morning.

30:23
Okay, so maybe the answer is that we just =
tackle the UK ones and see how Far we get with the time difference, I would=
 assume most of these are nos. I'm just going to throw that out there. I do=
 not believe that the majority of these are necessary. I am fairly =
fascinated with the primary 1, the line 112 there. I have no idea who in =
Rockford would have access to that. It's not on our list or on the project =
mapping list. So there's some crossover there that we need to figure out =
where that came from, so on and so forth. So I would estimate that we'll =
have answers by today's Thursday. They're already asleep. If they get =
responsive tomorrow, we could say Monday for at least the UK portion of =
this. But it depends on how early I can get up to catch those folks before =
they log off for the day. So we'll say we'll try for Monday, see how we get=
. I don't think it will happen tomorrow though.

31:32
Yeah, and sorry, I think I fat fingered and went on mute and was talking =
and then I didn't want to interrupt you, but no worries. It's my fault. I =
think if you could send that note just. And correct me if I'm if I misheard=
, if you could send the note to Mohan and Shankar on the exercise. We're =
mapping the users to the projects in the same file. We can combine the =
phone calls that we have as long as the calendars are in sync. And I'll =
stop there. Did I recap that correctly? And then let me know if we don't =
want to combine the calls. But I think we should.

32:19
I think it makes sense. I. I have an email out to Mohan already and I have =
not heard back from him yet. So I would not want to commit to a finish date=
 until I hear from Mohan. But if we're going to talk to him on Tuesday =
anyway, I think that's a good idea.

32:38
So Amanda and Adam, I'll add you=
 both to the sync with the India team. Does that work?

32:46
Good for me.

32:48
Yep. What. What time is it?

32:50
It's going to be 8:30 Central.

32:53
Well, that's not bad. 8:30am Correct. All right. You have to check =
sometimes.

33:07
And that's twice a week, right? Rachel? It's just Tuesday=
. Thursday.

33:10
It's just Tuesday. You're on the cadence. Nick, I'm not =
sure if you're following where I'm at.

33:24
I see it now.

33:26
Do you want it to be twice a week? Is that what we're thinking?

33:30
It should probably be twice a week and it should probably be longer than =
half an hour with both the teams. So it should probably be one hour and =
then twice a week. And I know that time on Thursday is already blocked with=
 the program review, but I don't know how flexible calendars are for the =
India team on that. Thursday, I think Friday morning would be fine as well.

34:06
So Tuesday, that could be a cultural thing. I'm not sure how late =
India works on Friday nights.

34:12
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I forget =
that it's Friday night. Yep. But I do think a second meeting makes the most=
 sense.

34:28
I mean, do we want to flip it to Monday, Wednesday and see =
if.

34:31
We can to that if calendars work, I think Monday, Wednesday for =
an hour each make a lot of sense. And then there's potential. Right. Once =
we're. If we feel super confident, super ahead on the plan across both =
instances, we can go to once a week. Right. And so that's our. That's our =
reward, everybody. We. We have less meetings, but I don't think we're there=
 yet. Any qualms with that on your side? Rachel? Amanda, Adam, Todd, Mac?

35:09
No, that sounds great.

35:10
Nope, run here.

35:13
Okay.

35:16
And so then Amanda, on the dispositioning task, we sync with that team as =
of right now, Tuesday. Maybe we'll change the meeting cadence after Tuesday=
. But we need the connection with Mohan to say our dispositions are =
complete. Of course we need Mohan's feedback on that. But if you had an =
assumption you can make on that time frame, because we do have to submit a =
date tomorrow, what would your assumption be? And we're not going to say =
Amanda told us, so don't worry. But we just need some type of direction to =
that.

35:53
It might based off of this sheet, I think the fastest answer =
is probably going to be next Friday. I don't want to commit to anything =
sooner than that only because I haven't reached out to the UK folks at all.=
 So I need to identify those resources and speak with them specifically. My=
 guess, my best guess here is that very little of the remaining pieces here=
 are actually day one transfers. But that's the piece I want the UK folks =
to confirm for me. Most of this should be Collins data and should not be =
required to transfer, but that's what I need from UK because we rock for do=
 not access. So as soon as I hear from them, that's really going to be the =
answer when we finish. So at this point in time, I will say Friday. It =
should not take them longer than Friday to respond. And if it does, I will =
request your assistance in moving this up the food chain.

37:06
Okay. I don't think there's an issue with next Friday, if we do have to =
change it from then, then it's going to require cr, which means we have to =
go up through the smo. So we hope to avoid that. But you know, the process =
exists for a reason, so I don't think there's anything wrong with it. But =
if we're aligned on next Friday, then let's go for it.

37:39
Victor, changing it accurately. We're changing this date to the 28th. Is =
that correct? No, that would be the. That's Bangalore.

38:00
Yeah, they're both gonna be Bangalore, actually. I mean Bangalore. They're =
both going to be the 28th because we're gonna sync those timelines.

38:11
But is it Bangalore complete?

38:18
Bangalore instance. For the Bangalore =
instance. I need to get that update. I don't have that update.

38:29
Mac, were you following that? I'm not sure. I thought we were under the =
impression they were complete.

38:35
Complete for what? Sorry?

38:37
For dispositioning.

38:39
Yeah, Bangalore, I think is complete. That was =
my understanding.

38:46
Yeah, I think we can easily confirm that. But.

38:49
Well, I mean, we have that. I mean the Bangalore sheet, right? Like =
we got the. The Bangalore projects from Mohan and Shankar and they've =
tagged all of them. I think that we had asked them to go back and add =
additional detail related to the number of work items. But the preliminary =
disposition I think is complete.

39:14
I think it's simple enough for. =
Simple enough for us to confirm that.

39:18
Yeah, let's drop them in here.

39:21
Because I'm gonna need. We're need to draft a pretty succinct agenda=
 and descriptive agenda for Tuesday so I can add that. But if it's complete=
, that's great.

39:33
Yeah, we're changing it to Monday Wednesday. Correct=
.

39:38
If you think the short notice and people can attend, then, yeah, =
we should do it now. Okay, but you have your weekly at that second half =
hour on Mondays. But of course, I think that's a smaller group, so.

40:02
Yep. I was thinking to go from 8 to 9 Central.

40:11
That works for me.

40:14
Or either one. It doesn't matter.

40:19
Yeah, I am flexible to. To =
whatever you schedule. I think it's the. The other resources.

40:25
Amanda and Adam, do you guys have any complaints to 8:30 to 9:30 Monday and=
 Wednesday?

40:37
I don't believe so.

40:43
Looks like that's free for me=
.

40:46
Yeah, I have a conflict on Monday, but I can swap that out with =
somebody, so we should be okay.

40:54
And just to confirm that 8:30 =
Central would be what, India time?

41:01
What, 13 and a half hours now? =
Where's my world clock? It's like seven at night. Doesn't sound right.

41:14
Yep, I think that's right. So maybe we make it 8 to 9 just to be =
cognizant for them to make that 6:30pm for them.

41:25
I'm fine with that. Anything that isn't a 3am meeting I'm good with.

41:34
Yep. Mac and I are on the west coast, so it's a 6am meeting for us.

41:40
It's always the challenge of working with the team in the uk. They get up =
really early.

41:47
All right. I've added Adam, Amanda, Rachel Gallagher =
and Prashant to the kids as well.

41:56
Lovely. And so I know we're well =
over is try to look at these dates because we do have to lock them tomorrow=
 and any date with your name on it, Adam or Amanda, we get your =
confirmation and so I know we're well over time I have time. I can stay on =
the call if we want to do it live. Also happy I think to send this offline =
but we do need the feedback by end of day.

42:38
Well, I mean one of those=
 is really simple. Confirm naming convention Valerian project copies ETRFD_=
 project name in front of all these projects. Do we care?

42:55
I don't.

42:58
There you go, Mac. We don't care.

43:02
Well, I think that's only =
for. I think that's only for the ones that we copy. For ones that we're not=
 copying. We don't need to change the name on them. Cool.

43:09
You want to filter on Rockford and A.

43:14
Are there any projects that =
are. I'll call it comments shared between consent actuations we've talked =
about?

43:20
No, none. So the.

43:22
That's a good thing.

43:24
Well, what we're doing there is. As Rachel and I went through them, most of=
 what we're seeing is so and so was added like Collins ALM management team =
and Jacob Gregg is a member of that team. Is there actuation data there? No=
. Were we added to the list because there's stuff we might be interested in=
? Yes. Do we need that information? Nope. Too bad. So there's. There's =
stuff. There's stuff in there. There's quite a bit of those kinds of pieces=
 where there is no actuation specific data and there is not data that =
actuation needs to do business or more importantly that's not duplicated =
someplace else that they can get to. So none of the instances we, Rachel =
and I made that determination that we would. It's an either or not a shared=
. So for the majority of those pieces it truly black and white and the only=
 ones we didn't know what they were using the database for are the ones =
where we have to contact India or the UK.

44:40
Great answer. I like it.

44:44
All right, so row 19 then becomes 328.

44:50
Yep. So that would be the same as this counterpart one.

44:53
Right.

44:56
So both Adam and you will have it confirmed on the same day. Is that =
what we're saying?

45:00
That sounds right. Yes.

45:02
All right, sounds good. Thank you.

45:06
Draft Valerian Project copy. Oh, =
that's you guys. Not me. Not us. Not us. Not us. Not us. Not us. Not us. =
Actuation user validation of Cloudme Project test copies. So when we get =
down into the prototyping section, we are waiting for the magic super user.=
 Oh, no, that's the next line. So what's the. What's 30 and 31, then?

45:37
I think that's validating the technical approach. Nick, you're on =
mute. I'm not sure if you want to jump in.

46:00
Hey, all, can you hear me=
?

46:01
Yes.

46:02
Yep.

46:06
All right, so for 30 and 31, it's =
validation of the copy. Is that, yes, it now exists as a act_d._ new =
project or.

46:20
Yes, I believe so.

46:21
Okay.

46:23
And Rachel, could you filter owner column for Adam or Rachel or Amanda?

46:34
And I think some of these. Amanda, we can almost say obe, because.

46:38
Yeah.

46:38
You're determined that we don't have to do them.

46:41
That's where I'm going. Yep.

46:42
Yep.

46:43
There's some stuff in here =
I don't think we need to do anymore.

46:46
Yep. Which is great.

46:48
I think so, too. There's stuff we can do. Okay, so then 30 and 31 are. Open=
 it. Make sure it works. Check it out. Okay. Which would require us having =
access to the tool. That could be its own problem. So. All right, let me. =
Let me walk through that in my head. Because if the answer to we have to =
validate the project test copy, from an admin standpoint, it's did it copy =
over? Did it work? I don't think either. And Crandall speak up, but I don't=
 think either Adam or myself would know if it worked or not. We don't open =
the tool as it is, so I don't think we would be able to tell you if it came=
 over correctly or not. I don't know. Yeah, it opens. There's stuff in =
there that's good.

47:53
I would say anything for copying is obe, though. =
We're not copying anything. Essentially, all we're going to be doing here =
is updating permissions on this instance.

48:03
Then do 30 and 31 become =
obe by themselves?

48:07
I would say so. Anybody else disagree?

48:10
Yeah, I think I agree. Once we get that Confirmed validation from your =
outstanding ones, Amanda. That we have to double check with people. If that=
 becomes that everything is columns or activation specific, then those go =
away.

48:25
All right, that gets rid of those. What else is due? Identify =
super users. Well, is that really a task for Adam and I to work on that we =
need to identify those super users?

48:38
Well, we just talked about that =
one.

48:40
Yeah, I know. That's fine. That's why I'm asking.

48:42
Yeah, yeah, no worries. So I think we'd have to reword those based on the =
strategy we just defined. So I took notes on that one. So we can. We can =
skip those. If you can highlight the super user ones in yellow, Rachel, =
we'll have to rename those.

49:01
All right. Row 45. Does that also become=
 OBE now? I think if I. Nope.

49:09
I would agree.

49:10
Done.

49:11
I'm sorry, when we say obe, what does that mean?

49:14
Overcome by events. So the fact that we don't have any common project or =
entangled projects we don't have.

49:22
Instead of the gray color just =
then, I'd make the note.

49:27
You're saying to close.

49:29
Well, it sounds like there may not be. These projects may not exist, so we =
may not need to validate. We don't have to validate something that doesn't =
exist. If I'm understanding that correctly.

49:40
Yeah. It'll be based on =
disposition.

49:44
Correct.

49:48
Okay.

49:51
So then the only. If I. If=
. If I'm understanding correctly. 53, 54, 57. None of those are all obe as =
well.

50:04
I think 54 stays.

50:06
Okay. All right.

50:07
Because that would be validating. That, like everything that is made for =
actuation, though, is like four and a half projects.

50:14
We called out that.

50:15
They're good.

50:16
Okay. All right, that's =
cool.

50:20
Yeah, that's a good catch.

50:30
Apologies, folks. I need to =
drop. But, Nick, you've got this. Let me know if there's anything anybody =
needs. Thank y'all.

50:39
Thanks. I think Your comment in 54 needs to be =
updated. Right, Rachel, I think you said that that.

thank you. So that&#x27;s already been sorted. So we&#x27;ve identified =
451-2345. So one of our instances isn&#x27;t showing up on the list. That =
Belfara CP piece, line 114. Line 114 didn&#x27;t show up on the other =
spreadsheet. So we added it for most of the other stuff. I guess that first=
 row is the best example. When I was saying that we don&#x27;t use the =
instance. The test equipment ALM Bularian database. We opened it, we put =
one thing in it, we&#x27;re done. Never opened it since. So the majority of=
 these don&#x27;t have anything useful to us. Now the rest of these. So ask=
 Shankar at GT gc. We don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing with their =
ALM stuff but that&#x27;s not us. So I have no one in Rockford who can =
answer those questions. So that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s that piece and then =
same thing for some of those other ones. Row 112 is a good example. =
Actuation. Rockford was never worked on primary aircraft. So actuation was =
split in between what we call the big airplanes, right? 767, 737. The =
heavies and Rockford did the secondary class, the business jets. So row 112=
 there is primaries. That&#x27;s wolves. That&#x27;s not us or someone you =
know. Wolverhampton related. The other ones are probably Collins owned and =
operated. Collins Tech Alerts, the product safety Office, Collins Team =
center, plm. We don&#x27;t need any of those. But they&#x27;re not ours. So=
 we&#x27;re not sure if we should make that call or not. The only other one=
. So the first three unabashedly actuation. The Belfar SCP, that&#x27;s for=
 sure us. That row 114 there, that&#x27;s for sure us. We. We. That needs =
to go. We don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything in those that we&#x27;re =
really using. The only item of interest here is going to be row 464 which =
is the MC21. High lift. Whatever EM is that guy. Now that guy is a problem.=
 He&#x27;s a problem on two fronts. One, he belongs to Bangalore. Well the =
work is being done by Bangalore engineers. Okay. However, this is a Russian=
 aircraft and so the data for the Russian aircraft must remain in the =
United States per the license agreement. So that&#x27;s how Rockford =
inherited that particular piece. So the management and the access to that =
database is granted by Rachel, I think, and myself. Honestly, we have to =
grant them access to that on a limited basis because we inherited it from =
Phoenix. But it is my understanding that that particular piece of =
information must stay on the United States or in the United States. It =
cannot be managed on a European server and it certainly cannot be managed =
by an Indian server. The rest of everything in there Rachel and I had =
identified as probably not belonging to Rockford specifically and could be =
let go without repercussions for day one. Does that make sense?=

some point were probably going to combine these calls because we&#x27;re =
actively working on the same thing. Just separate instances. They have =
already gotten through this process of deciding which projects are in scope=
 or not. And so I think that that is what we had talked about holding off =
until. But it would be helpful to get with Mohan and Nick. We can just make=
 a note that that will probably be our follow up for the Bangalore Weekly =
or bi weekly cadence to talk through that app because I know that that came=
 up in our conversation Rachel yesterday with Rachel Gallagher as well. And=
 so I think that we need to ask them are they done with the work? Is it =
still an open project? And then what type of data is in there? And someone =
needs to make that decision about whether or not a copy gets made and where=
 it gets stored and so on and so forth. So we can put that one to bed. And =
then I think these other ones make sense. Is there anything, what is the =
filter that&#x27;s applied on this sheet? Is there anything else? 1. I just=
 want to make sure that we&#x27;re not missing anything and thank you =
Amanda so much for adding that that project. Do we feel confident that we =

is truly the only one that&#x27;s actually. Oh, and I&#x27;m going to catch=
 flack for this but truly the only one that&#x27;s actively being used by =
an actuation employee is the MC21 high lift. Right. The Bangalore folks, =
they liked ALM, they got into it, they&#x27;re using it on a daily basis. =
The other four were opened and I believe there&#x27;s stuff in there. Right=
? There&#x27;s 13 files, 193 files. We move stuff in there. Are any of =
those four being used on a day to day basis? No sir. Have they been used in=
 the last six to 18 months? No sir. Would any of them have been opened and =
used in the last 24 to 36 months? Now that&#x27;s more of a maybe. So is =
there information that is critical for day one for those first three? We =
don&#x27;t think so. We think the what&#x27;s in. We don&#x27;t have access=
 obviously, but we believe that what was loaded into those folders is =
duplicated in some other location. We just, you know, opened it to use the =
tool. Now that Belfara cp, I cannot make the same guarantee that might =
actually have stuff in it. We had started BELFARA about when they showed us=
 alm. I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s anything useful in there. I =
don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s anything we&#x27;re actively working on. So to=
 the previous question about needing to test, you know, links and active =
links to workbooks and whatnot within the database. None of those four =
would still need that activity. Testing, making sure stuff works. I do not =
believe there is sufficient day to day use of those four databases.=

don&#x27;t know how many times I can express that. So from a super user =
standpoint, I honestly don&#x27;t think there is going to be a quote =
unquote super user identified for Rockford actuation purposes. We just =
didn&#x27;t use the tool flat out. From the Collins side. It all belongs to=
 nategov or whoever owns ALM these days. So if it&#x27;s a Collins ALM =
management obviously goes up to somebody at corporate, so on and so forth. =
So there are individual pieces now I can tell you. I guess maybe the best =
example. So row 114 there, that&#x27;s Sheehan, the software manager. The =
ex software manager for actuation. She doesn&#x27;t work for Actuation =
anymore, she works for Collins. Could she tell you what&#x27;s in there? =
Maybe. Is she a super user? No sir. No, I don&#x27;t believe that I would =
identify anyone currently in. If Adam Crandall is not your actuation super =
user, I don&#x27;t believe I have a resource identified for that purpose.=

it would have been possible to do an offline thing for plm, so I&#x27;m =

because I haven&#x27;t reached out to the UK folks at all. So I need to =
identify those resources and speak with them specifically. My guess, my =
best guess here is that very little of the remaining pieces here are =
actually day one transfers. But that&#x27;s the piece I want the UK folks =
to confirm for me. Most of this should be Collins data and should not be =
required to transfer, but that&#x27;s what I need from UK because we rock =
for do not access. So as soon as I hear from them, that&#x27;s really going=
 to be the answer when we finish. So at this point in time, I will say =
Friday. It should not take them longer than Friday to respond. And if it =
does, I will request your assistance in moving this up the food chain.=
