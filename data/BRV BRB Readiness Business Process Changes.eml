BRV BRB Readiness Business Process Changes

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Business Process Changes and BRV/BRB Scope**
   - Rakesh explained =
that each function identifies which of their business processes will change=
 for BRV, particularly those effective August 1st.
   - For processes with =
changes, there may be associated system changes, though this is not =
guaranteed.

2. **ERP and System Changes**
   - The ERP system is not =
expected to undergo significant process changes during this transition.
   - The plan is for the ERP to largely function as usual, with only minor =
data modifications (removals or additions).
   - Most business processes =
themselves will continue as-is, with limited expected impact on supporting =
systems.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Readiness**
   - The scale and depth of UAT will be influenced by the extent of =
business and system changes, and the need for knowledge transfer (KT), =
especially for newly hired staff.
   - UAT readiness is being considered =
from a holistic BRB perspective, not just IT.

4. **Knowledge Transfer and =
New Hires**
   - A key challenge lies in ensuring adequate training and =
knowledge transfer for new employees joining due to process changes.

5. **Legal Entity Data**
   - Debate exists around the significance of =
legal entity data changes versus process changes.
   - Rakesh emphasizes =
legal entity considerations, while others are uncertain about its =
centrality.

6. **Next Steps and Uncertainties**
   - Some participants are=
 not fully informed yet and plan to connect with Rakesh for clarification.
   - Objectives include clarifying UAT scope, identifying participants, and=
 determining tactical execution plans.
   - An upcoming working session, =
led by Rakesh, aims to resolve open questions and define immediate actions.

**Action Items / Follow-Ups:**

- Reach out to Rakesh for clarification on=
 the relationship between business process changes, system changes, and =
legal entity data implications.
- Confirm the detailed scope of UAT, =
including which processes, systems, and personnel will be involved.
- Attend the working session to help finalize tactical plans and next steps=
 for BRV/BRB readiness, focused on the August 1st changes.

Their business. So the way that Rakesh is explaining it is that, you =
know, for all the, you know, if we start with the business process, the, =
the different functions will have X amount of different processes that they=
 have in their scope and they will identify which of those processes are =
changing on for BRV or for August 1st based on those process changes. There=
 may or may not most likely will have system changes. So based off of the, =
the process change, if there's any system change, if there's KT needed for,=
 you know, if people need to be, you know, new, New Athens people need to =
be hired, there's a whole list of how intense or how kind of, you know, =
CHILL the, the UAT needs to be. That's kind of a 30, 000 foot level. Does =
that, does that make sense?

0:52
Yep.

0:54
So how did the, Rakesh, how do=
.

0:56
The, how do the business processes that you're talking about, like =
the processes that are going to change for day one, like how is that =
related to the ERP system?

1:06
Yeah. So basically it's not just erp, =
Right. It's all the applications that are in BRB scope. But for the most =
part with erp, we're not really doing any. There shouldn't really be any =
any process changes. Right. We're essentially just saying this system is =
going to operate the way it's operating today, is going to operate the same=
 tomorrow. We're just taking out some information and we're adding in some =
information that's at a high level what we're doing. The business process =
itself that's, you know, the business will have to determine what is =
changing, what is not changing. And you know, for the most part there =
shouldn't be too much of a system change to it. So I would expect it to be =
minimal. I think what's to be a more of a, a sticking point. And it's not =
just uat. This kind of holistic kind of BRB readiness is knowledge transfer=
 for new people that are being hired. Right. So again, this is where I'm, =
I'm getting a little fuzzy. I don't understand how this relates to the IT =
side as much because if a business process is changing and you have a new =
person being hired, sure you have to train that person up and, and =
everything.

2:09
But I think it ties back to the, I think it ties back to =
the legal entity piece.

2:17
Say that again.

2:18
I think it ties back to the legal entity piece.

2:22
Why do you say that?

2:24
When I talked to Rakesh, that was what he was big harping on, was.

2:31
I don't know about that, not you. But I don't think. I don't agree =
with Rakesh as much because, yeah, there's going to be legal entity data =
that is changing, but the actual process itself is. I. I don't know. Let's =
talk to him. Yeah, he's been driving this for the last few weeks. I don't =
want to give you wrong information. I'm, you know, just got pulled into =
this literally yesterday. Okay. So still trying to understand exactly what =
they. What they need here, but essentially they're just trying to be able =
to scope out what they need to do for uat, who are the people that need to =
be involved, and how they're gonna actually, you know, tactically do it. =
That's kind of the plan for Tom of cool, but it seems like he wants to make=
 this more of a working session than anything else. But let's connect with =
him and figure out what his. His next steps are.

3:18
Cool.

3:19
Cool. All right, man. Appreciate it.

3:21
Okay, thanks.

3:22
See you.

3:22
Appreciate it. Bye.

basically it&#x27;s not just erp, Right. It&#x27;s all the applications =

Right. We&#x27;re essentially just saying this system is going to operate =
the way it&#x27;s operating today, is going to operate the same tomorrow. =
We&#x27;re just taking out some information and we&#x27;re adding in some =
information that&#x27;s at a high level what we&#x27;re doing. The business=
 process itself that&#x27;s, you know, the business will have to determine =
what is changing, what is not changing. And you know, for the most part =
there shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a system change to it. So I would =

you have to train that person up and, and everything.</div></div><div =
