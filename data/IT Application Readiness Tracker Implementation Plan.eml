IT Application Readiness Tracker Implementation Plan

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Establishing an IT Application Tracker**
    - The team is initiating a tracker to monitor the readiness and status =
of ~80 IT applications for upcoming go-lives, specifically distinguishing =
between:
        - Applications going live in June/July (requiring SIT, UAT=
, and go-live stages).
        - Applications related to legal entity =
changes, expected to go live around August 1.
        - Additional =
applications (build backs, move as is) set for post-July, into August or =
September.
    - The goal is to provide a detailed, dashboard-driven view =
of progress across all applications in scope.

2. **Transition from Excel =
to Smartsheet**
    - Initially, data will be collated in Excel before =
being migrated to Smartsheet for better tracking, dashboarding, and =
reporting capability.
    - The Smartsheet will be used to provide =
executive-level dashboard visuals (histograms, pie charts) for real-time =
tracking.

3. **Structural Requirements for the Tracker**
    - Key columns/fields to be included:
        - System (application) =
name
        - IT workstream/business function and sub-function
        - Service owner (both from Honeywell and Athens, for =
cloned/build-back apps)
        - KT (Knowledge Transfer) completed status
        - Test lead identified
        - Test cases documented
        - Test cases uploaded
        - SIT (System Integration Testing) =
start, end, and status
        - UAT (User Acceptance Testing) start, end, =
and status
        - Go-live date/status
        - Comments column for =
additional context
    - The intention is not to nest columns but rather =
have each as a standalone field for clear tracking.

4. **Governance and Coordination**
    - The importance of project =
management discipline is emphasized, addressing the need to =E2=80=9CPM the=
 crap out of this=E2=80=9D due to coordinators depending heavily on the =
project team.
    - Each app will be tracked at a granular level, requiring=
 significant coordinator input.
    - Suggestions to engage Justin or the =
GDS team for technical implementation of the tracker, with particular =
reference to leveraging Audrey Park=E2=80=99s expertise in Smartsheet =
dashboarding.

5. **Calendar & Meeting Planning**
    - Alongside the =
tracker, a two-week calendar (spanning from June 2, 2025, to June 13, 2025)=
 will be set up to align meetings and follow-ups, especially if missing =
data or updates are identified through the tracker.

6. **Dashboarding and Executive Reporting**
    - The tracker will feed =
into executive dashboarding tools for regular reporting to leadership (e.g.=
, =E2=80=9CTsukai=E2=80=9D and others), illustrating key KPIs:
        - % SIT completed, % UAT started/completed, % KT =
complete/incomplete, number of go-lives, etc.
    - Data hygiene is =
recognized as a concern; teams will be expected to clean up and validate =
reported data, supplemented with automated pulls where possible.

7. **Defect Management**
    - Defects will not be tracked in this primary =
tracker; dedicated defect and Hypercare trackers will be referenced for =
managing UAT issues and post-go-live support.

**Action Items & =
Follow-ups:**

- Prepare the initial list and structure in Excel; migrate =
to Smartsheet.
- Identify and enter approximately 80 in-scope applications =
(build back, move as is, outsourced, legal entity-related, etc.) into the =
tracker.
- Reach out to Justin (GDS) and Audrey Park for Smartsheet =
implementation support/tips.
- Populate the tracker with existing data and =
set up a dashboard view for executives by Friday of the current week.
- Schedule and organize meetings for missing updates/data between June =
2=E2=80=9313, 2025.
- Determine each team=E2=80=99s windows for SIT and UAT=
, ensuring flexibility to capture variations in timing.
- Run weekly (or as needed) executive reports using the dashboard.
- Ensure teams clean up or validate data periodically before reporting.

**Key Dates Mentioned:**
- Tracker and calendar planning starts June 2, =
2025.
- Target period for alignment and calendar: June 2=E2=80=9313, 2025.
- Application go-lives: Some in June/July 2025; legal entity apps around =
August 1, 2025; others post-July into August/September.
- Dashboard and tracker expected to be viewable/executable by Friday (June =
6, 2025).
 =20
**Participants Referenced:**
- Justin (GDS team), Audrey =
Park (Smartsheet expertise), Avinash (coordination), possible executive =
stakeholders (Tsukai), and other unnamed IT workstream leads.

This summary encapsulates the planning, technical, and organizational =
efforts discussed in the transcript for building a detailed IT application =
readiness tracker and associated reporting/dashboards, along with steps for=
 ensuring accountability and data quality across workstreams through =
mid-June 2025.

Transcript:
0:01
And start putting down. So based on the =
notes we captured, you may want to just pull up in Excel and we start doing=
 this and then we'll see how we can turn it into a smartsheet.

0:12
Yep.

0:12
Definitely two things I want to do in the conversation today. One is =
to get this tracker going and we'll see how we can get Justin or GDS to =
help us in that. Two, calendaring all these things for this mos. So we need=
 to kind of say, okay, if I don't have this, I need to set up a meeting. So=
, you know, based on the tracker, I don't have this, I don't have that. =
Let's go set up a meeting. So I want to do like a two week calendar between=
 today and the 6th or 13th, essentially to have alignment across all these =
IT work streams and these functions.

0:50
Yep, yep. Give me one second.

0:54
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take your time. Because I realize, you know, from =
Avinash and these guys, you know, they, they're meant to be the =
coordinators, but it's clear, it's. If it wasn't already for me that =
they're looking at us to spoon feed them everything.

1:09
Yeah.

1:10
And so we need to PM the crap out of this in terms of just bringing that =
structure in place of, you know, know we're going to hit this every single =
day and drive, drive to the, to the details.

1:23
Yep, absolutely. Here, =
I'm just pulling up this Excel and then I'll share. Trying to load it. Turn=
 it. Oh, there we go. I got it open on my computer. Okay, so let me just =
share this one. Oops. So folks have gone in and populated all of these, =
which is great.

1:55
Okay.

1:58
And I guess.

1:59
And they've added some comments. Okay, yeah, see comments in column P. Okay=
.

2:16
Oh, great.

2:17
Need to understand what applications these cover. =
Okay, fine.

2:27
So for today, I guess there's a couple things we can =
start to plan out. What do we want to track? I still have that underlying =
question of who is like at what level of granularity is this going to be =
tracked at? It sounds like all of these or a lot of these work streams have=
 their own processes ongoing. Right. For uat, from that, like the ISC touch=
 base. Like so from the ISC touch base, they were showing all of those. =
Like each work stream, I guess had like a status or a plan or it seemed =
like there were some with plans that included uat. And so to get down to =
the level of detail that we need to build some of the dashboards, as Peirce=
 is expecting, all of those people have to come to someone and say here at =
the individual test or scenario level, here's everything that we have =
planned which is not light touch.

3:37
Well that's where we'll have the =
coordinator. So think of it this way. What the way I'm seeing this play out=
. So let's look at UAT. So there are simply from an IT lens you've got let =
us say our number 80 something applications. There are some applications =
going live in June and July that have to go through SIT UAT go live. There =
are some applications going live on, in and around August 1st that are =
related to the legal entity or thereabouts. So that those have a broader =
like an ERP that has an SIT UAT cycle or multiple windows. And then you =
have another non BRV related set of applications that are like the build =
backs and the move as is that are going to post July, so July, August or =
post August. So August and September. For each of those applications we =
need to track status and dashboarding on where things are in terms of go =
live readiness. So that's one set of tracker we need to have. So if you =
think about it and let's maybe put open up a PowerPoint and we'll just jot =
down these, pencil in these bullet points and say will need a tracker for =
these BRV and non BRV at an app level we are going to use where you have =
applications to touch. We'll have a view of if you want to pull up.

5:21
This was our previous dashboard page where we had said like three talk =
about systems functional end to end. I guess the application level needs to=
. Is like what we're missing here.

5:33
Well, application systems, right. =
So it's. So I'm talking of let's say tracker number one where the apps are =
the rows and we're going to have. Let's also add the service owner, right? =
So service owner, let's add in so in parentheses when you have all that =
stuff there, start with service owner. Start with maybe we call it service =
owner identified or point of POC service owner identified. And then maybe a=
 second thing is test lead identified. The third one is if the service =
owner is there. Let's say for example an app is being built back. It is =
being built back from Honeywell which is essentially like a clone. It's =
moving into Athens. So we need to know if there is a knowledge transfer =
that has happened. So we also need something around KT to say I've cloned =
this app, I've transferred all the knowledge to this person and the Athens =
side that's going to run it now, so that service owner would have had to do=
 that from an IT perspective. And then you're going to get into, okay, sit =
dates, UAT dates and go live dates. So sit, start, end or complete, you =
know, start and end. And you can say status, you know, is in progress, or =
complete or not started and then, or delayed and then UAT the same thing. =
So this is purely from a systems perspective. We can look at the non TS8 =
systems that have this. Now later on we can do something for the TS8 =
systems as well. But let's at least start with this as a tracker having =
these fields and then we can possibly have 50 or 60 or 70 rows for each of =
the systems for each of the apps in the inventory.

7:45
Yep.

7:48
So this is the first tracker that we need. So the first actually you may =
want to start off with. So first number one is the service owner. The first=
 bullet point is service owner identified and then KT completed, service =
owner slash poc. And then, you know, the next thing is the test lead. And =
then the next thing is we could just say test cases documented. Test cases.=
 I'm trying to give a couple more of, you know, test cases documented, test=
 cases developed and you know, are uploaded into say Jira or whatever tool =
it is. We could say, you know, so first one is test cases documented. The =
second one, the second bullet point there would be, you know, test cases =
uploaded. Okay. Keep it at a single level. I don't want nesting here. Just =
these are different columns. So test cases documented. In fact, if you, if =
you take it one step back, we have to see if.

9:23
Do we want to track the functions?

9:24
Let's assume that. Say that again,=
 do we want to.

9:27
Track like the functions that it touches?

9:30
Well, no, this is a system. So we should say actually work stream or it, =
you know, we should call another first column, should be it workstream, =
whether it's, you know, if it's something that's a supply chain or a =
finance, you know, app. So business, you can say business, you know, =
business app or whatever. Our standard naming is business, business =
function, sub function. Right. So function, slash, sub function, maybe a =
couple of those. And then you've got the service owner, you've got the test=
 lead, you've got the test cases documented. And then the next bullet is =
test cases uploaded. Don't. Yeah, don't do parentheses. I want them =
multiple. So the first thing there is you're documenting. I need 20 test =
cases. How many do I have? You know, how many have I do I need to create? =
And then at the end of the day, all 20 need to be uploaded in. So test =
cases documented, test cases uploaded, and then we know it's into the =
tracking tool. So that's fine. So just say test cases uploaded. You already=
 got test cases completed. Well, let's do this. Remove that for now. Remove=
. Remove that completed for now. And you could remove the poc because =
that's done. You need to add. Okay, just say KT completed.

11:17
And remove to Athens poc.

11:19
Yeah. Yep, yep. I would also say one thing=
 here. I would add Honeywell service owner, the second bullet. Honeywell =
service owner poc. I would add a third bullet. That's Athens service owner,=
 poc. Because if this is a move as is, then it's, they're probably the same=
 name. But if it's a build back and it's a clone, then it's likely that =
there's a good chance that somebody else in Athens. So we've got KT =
completed.

12:02
What about like the system name.

12:06
System? That is the systems, that's the app name. So the app as a row, it =
says, you know, column number one would be AppX. And then the next part of =
that, the rest of it would be functions and all the other stuff. So yeah, =
you could put system name as, you know. So column one. So systems tracker =
would be system one. Yeah, our system name is the first one actually. Then =
can you move KT completed after Athens service owner? The intent is that =
they, they identify the leads. Okay, test lead, test documented, sit start.=
 Let's, you know, let's, let's parse this out. So sit, start sitting and =
then sit completion status and then we'll do the same for uat. Okay. And =
then we should have go live. So this is essentially like a project plan, =
but we should have this as a tracker for every app that is in scope. So in =
scope meaning the move as is the build backs, the clones and all of the =
legal entity changes. So can you repeat that? So we should have this for =
all the apps that are in scope, that are for BRV or non brv. So anything =
that's a. So anything that's a build back, anything that's a move as is =
build back includes the clones, anything that's outsourced, whether it's =
legal entity related or non legal entity related. And I think there's about=
 80 something of them that a ballpark number that we. So we should have =
about 80 something rows that we're tracking.

14:41
So that covers build back outsourced.

14:44
Build back outsourced, move as=
 is. And I'm thinking lib without but lib without probably means they take =
the data if needed and move it. And I don't think we need to track it here,=
 even though there might be some sign off that all data is moved. But I =
think so at a dashboard level, this is what we can, this is what the model =
should track. So that at any one point, if you run a BI dashboard or =
something on this that says I've got play this out. 80 apps in scope, 20 of=
 them in situation, 10 of them in UAT, 90% KT completed, you know, two of =
them have gone live, etc. So we're going to have, you know, that view and =
we'll be able to publish it week on week.

15:51
Do you want to track =
defects here?

16:02
Not here. That would come in the cutover Hypercare. =
There's a separate thing for Hypercare that may be a double click into UAT =
complete. So similar to what, what pre was sharing on the defects and the =
resolution and how many have been resolved, etc. We may want to double =
click into a UAT tracker. We'll have to see what they already have in Jira =
or whatever tool it is and do. We don't want to, I don't want to reinvent =
anything. They may have something and we can repurpose. But this should be =
in a smartsheet and we can run a report on it that provides some dashboard =
view that now people can say here's a histogram of things happening. So you=
 can see that it will move from left to right. Eventually every one of =
these would go live, but they would be in different phases at different =
points. So week and week we could run a report. So this is what we should =
mock up as a view in either histogram view or a pie chart or something or a=
 blend of both or just boxes three that we'll be able to track status on =
this.

17:24
Yep. Okay.

17:27
So if I'm Sukai, I come in today and I go, =
oh, I've got 20 apps in Sid that are completing that are 80% complete. I've=
 got 10 apps that are starting UAT, have started UAT and I've completed 57%=
 of my knowledge transfer. And by the way, I'm behind on 10, 20% of my =
knowledge transfer hasn't even started yet. And then I am, you know, to the=
 other point you had on defects. Maybe she goes into the next tracker. If =
she double clicks into UAT tracker to see how is that progressing for uat. =
Right. So that's a secondary tracker but at a high level she or the =
leadership should be able to get a view of what's the progress on these =
applications. So that's tracker number one at a system level. And this is =
what we need to work with Justin or whoever in GDS on our team to see if we=
 can create this in smartsheets and pull the data we have. How comfortable =
are you with smartsheets?

18:34
I've used it a lot. You know who's used it=
 the most though? Who built some of the best? Audrey park on GE Healthcare =
built this incredibly complicated dashboard and reporting structure for GE =
Healthcare that was used all the way until the end for. Yes, she was. She =
got really good at it. So I know that Audrey is good at smartsheet and I =
have a fair amount of experience as well. Well, so between the two of us, =
I'm not sure what Justin's bandwidth looks like or.

19:10
Yeah. And I know Audrey is busy this week as well. But let we can talk to =
Audrey, see if she can spend some time on that for us or at least.

19:19
Provide some lessons learned. Some like tips from like she was actually =
implementing it.

19:25
Okay.

19:26
And I was kind of helping guide her =
direction. And so I would love to just maybe take half an hour and say if =
you don't implement this, can you tell me what you would do for this?

19:38
Because what I would like to do is get a dashboard going with the =
right histograms and the charts, et cetera. That's really more executive =
level that Tsukai can come into that dashboard and refresh and say this is =
the data that feeds it. And precisely what we mentioned a bit earlier, I =
have a status view on how things are progressing. So that's step number one=
 that we want to get a view in by Friday and populate this with accurate =
data. Now, hygiene of the data is a different story. You heard on the all =
IT connect that the supply chain team said, oh, we've started sit. The ERP =
team said, we've started sit. Great, let's start reporting on it. Right? =
Wrong, let's report on it. Let them clean up the data and go in here and =
clean it up. Right. So where it's automated, pull great. If not, we, we =
show them the data that this is what it is from the thing. They can =
overwrite it and you know, understand what this, you know, the thing is, =
what I also want to get out of this is different teams may have different =
UAT dates. Generally the window, the windows 620 to 715 supply chain may =
say it's 623 to 629 and they're done. ERP may say 620 to 627, 77 to 715. =
They may have multiple windows. So we need to give that provision for them =
to. To be able to. What I want to also do is get that calendar view. Right.=
 So the other ask that. So this is so step number one, we need this systems=
 view dashboard that people can get to do we have end of day connect.

21:21
Yeah, Right now.

21:22
Really? Okay, so let's get on that and then =
we'll come back and continue with this.

21:26
Okay, cool. Sounds great. =
Thanks for catching by.

 Topics Discussed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Establishing an IT Application =
Tracker</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The team is initiating a tracker to monitor =
the readiness and status of ~80 IT applications for upcoming go-lives, =
specifically distinguishing between:<ul>
<li>Applications going live in =
June/July (requiring SIT, UAT, and go-live stages).</li>
<li>Applications related to legal entity changes, expected to go live =
around August 1.</li>
<li>Additional applications (build backs, move as is)=
 set for post-July, into August or September.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The goal is to provide a detailed, dashboard-driven view of progress =
across all applications in scope.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Transition from Excel to Smartsheet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, data will be collated in Excel before being migrated to=
 Smartsheet for better tracking, dashboarding, and reporting capability.=
</li>
<li>The Smartsheet will be used to provide executive-level dashboard =
visuals (histograms, pie charts) for real-time tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Structural Requirements for the =
Tracker</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key columns/fields to be included:<ul>
<li>System (application) name</li>
<li>IT workstream/business function and =
sub-function</li>
<li>Service owner (both from Honeywell and Athens, for =
cloned/build-back apps)</li>
<li>KT (Knowledge Transfer) completed =
status</li>
<li>Test lead identified</li>
<li>Test cases documented</li>
<li>Test cases uploaded</li>
<li>SIT (System Integration Testing) start, =
end, and status</li>
<li>UAT (User Acceptance Testing) start, end, and =
status</li>
<li>Go-live date/status</li>
<li>Comments column for additional=
 context</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The intention is not to nest columns but =
rather have each as a standalone field for clear tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Governance and =
Coordination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of project management =
discipline is emphasized, addressing the need to =E2=80=9CPM the crap out =
of this=E2=80=9D due to coordinators depending heavily on the project team.=
</li>
<li>Each app will be tracked at a granular level, requiring =
significant coordinator input.</li>
<li>Suggestions to engage Justin or the=
 GDS team for technical implementation of the tracker, with particular =
reference to leveraging Audrey Park=E2=80=99s expertise in Smartsheet =
dashboarding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Ca=
lendar &amp; Meeting Planning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alongside the tracker, =
a two-week calendar (spanning from June 2, 2025, to June 13, 2025) will be =
set up to align meetings and follow-ups, especially if missing data or =
updates are identified through the tracker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Dashboarding and Executive =
Reporting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The tracker will feed into executive =
dashboarding tools for regular reporting to leadership (e.g., =
=E2=80=9CTsukai=E2=80=9D and others), illustrating key KPIs:<ul>
<li>% SIT completed, % UAT started/completed, % KT complete/incomplete, =
number of go-lives, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data hygiene is recognized as=
 a concern; teams will be expected to clean up and validate reported data, =
supplemented with automated pulls where possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Defect Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Defects will not be tracked in this primary tracker; dedicated =
defect and Hypercare trackers will be referenced for managing UAT issues =
and post-go-live support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Action Items &amp; Follow-ups:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the initial list and structure in Excel; migrate to Smartsheet.=
</li>
<li>Identify and enter approximately 80 in-scope applications (build =
back, move as is, outsourced, legal entity-related, etc.) into the tracker.=
</li>
<li>Reach out to Justin (GDS) and Audrey Park for Smartsheet =
implementation support/tips.</li>
<li>Populate the tracker with existing =
data and set up a dashboard view for executives by Friday of the current =
week.</li>
<li>Schedule and organize meetings for missing updates/data =
between June 2=E2=80=9313, 2025.</li>
<li>Determine each team=E2=80=99s =
windows for SIT and UAT, ensuring flexibility to capture variations in =
timing.</li>
<li>Run weekly (or as needed) executive reports using the =
dashboard.</li>
<li>Ensure teams clean up or validate data periodically =
before reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key =
Dates Mentioned:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tracker and calendar planning starts=
 June 2, 2025.</li>
<li>Target period for alignment and calendar: June =
2=E2=80=9313, 2025.</li>
<li>Application go-lives: Some in June/July 2025; =
legal entity apps around August 1, 2025; others post-July into =
August/September.</li>
<li>Dashboard and tracker expected to be =

Right. For uat, from that, like the ISC touch base. Like so from the ISC =
touch base, they were showing all of those. Like each work stream, I guess =
had like a status or a plan or it seemed like there were some with plans =
that included uat. And so to get down to the level of detail that we need =
to build some of the dashboards, as Peirce is expecting, all of those =

that&#x27;s where we&#x27;ll have the coordinator. So think of it this way.=
 What the way I&#x27;m seeing this play out. So let&#x27;s look at UAT. So =
there are simply from an IT lens you&#x27;ve got let us say our number 80 =
something applications. There are some applications going live in June and =
July that have to go through SIT UAT go live. There are some applications =
going live on, in and around August 1st that are related to the legal =
entity or thereabouts. So that those have a broader like an ERP that has an=
 SIT UAT cycle or multiple windows. And then you have another non BRV =
related set of applications that are like the build backs and the move as =
is that are going to post July, so July, August or post August. So August =
and September. For each of those applications we need to track status and =
dashboarding on where things are in terms of go live readiness. So =
that&#x27;s one set of tracker we need to have. So if you think about it =
and let&#x27;s maybe put open up a PowerPoint and we&#x27;ll just jot down =
these, pencil in these bullet points and say will need a tracker for these =
BRV and non BRV at an app level we are going to use where you have =
applications to touch. We&#x27;ll have a view of if you want to pull up.=

><div style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Well, =
application systems, right. So it&#x27;s. So I&#x27;m talking of let&#x27;s=
 say tracker number one where the apps are the rows and we&#x27;re going to=
 have. Let&#x27;s also add the service owner, right? So service owner, =
let&#x27;s add in so in parentheses when you have all that stuff there, =
start with service owner. Start with maybe we call it service owner =
identified or point of POC service owner identified. And then maybe a =
second thing is test lead identified. The third one is if the service owner=
 is there. Let&#x27;s say for example an app is being built back. It is =
being built back from Honeywell which is essentially like a clone. =
It&#x27;s moving into Athens. So we need to know if there is a knowledge =
transfer that has happened. So we also need something around KT to say =
I&#x27;ve cloned this app, I&#x27;ve transferred all the knowledge to this =
person and the Athens side that&#x27;s going to run it now, so that service=
 owner would have had to do that from an IT perspective. And then =
you&#x27;re going to get into, okay, sit dates, UAT dates and go live dates=
. So sit, start, end or complete, you know, start and end. And you can say =
status, you know, is in progress, or complete or not started and then, or =
delayed and then UAT the same thing. So this is purely from a systems =
perspective. We can look at the non TS8 systems that have this. Now later =
on we can do something for the TS8 systems as well. But let&#x27;s at least=
 start with this as a tracker having these fields and then we can possibly =
have 50 or 60 or 70 rows for each of the systems for each of the apps in =
the inventory.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;bac=

is service owner identified and then KT completed, service owner slash poc.=
 And then, you know, the next thing is the test lead. And then the next =
thing is we could just say test cases documented. Test cases. I&#x27;m =
trying to give a couple more of, you know, test cases documented, test =
cases developed and you know, are uploaded into say Jira or whatever tool =
it is. We could say, you know, so first one is test cases documented. The =
second one, the second bullet point there would be, you know, test cases =

Just these are different columns. So test cases documented. In fact, if you=

put system name as, you know. So column one. So systems tracker would be =

project plan, but we should have this as a tracker for every app that is in=
 scope. So in scope meaning the move as is the build backs, the clones and =
all of the legal entity changes. So can you repeat that? So we should have =
this for all the apps that are in scope, that are for BRV or non brv. So =
anything that&#x27;s a. So anything that&#x27;s a build back, anything =
that&#x27;s a move as is build back includes the clones, anything =

the charts, et cetera. That&#x27;s really more executive level that Tsukai =
can come into that dashboard and refresh and say this is the data that =
feeds it. And precisely what we mentioned a bit earlier, I have a status =
view on how things are progressing. So that&#x27;s step number one that we =
want to get a view in by Friday and populate this with accurate data. Now, =
hygiene of the data is a different story. You heard on the all IT connect =
that the supply chain team said, oh, we&#x27;ve started sit. The ERP team =
said, we&#x27;ve started sit. Great, let&#x27;s start reporting on it. =
Right? Wrong, let&#x27;s report on it. Let them clean up the data and go in=
 here and clean it up. Right. So where it&#x27;s automated, pull great. If =
not, we, we show them the data that this is what it is from the thing. They=
 can overwrite it and you know, understand what this, you know, the thing =
is, what I also want to get out of this is different teams may have =
different UAT dates. Generally the window, the windows 620 to 715 supply =
chain may say it&#x27;s 623 to 629 and they&#x27;re done. ERP may say 620 =
to 627, 77 to 715. They may have multiple windows. So we need to give that =
provision for them to. To be able to. What I want to also do is get that =
calendar view. Right. So the other ask that. So this is so step number one,=
 we need this systems view dashboard that people can get to do we have end =
of day connect.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;ba=
