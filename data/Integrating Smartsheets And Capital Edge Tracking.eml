Meeting Summary

*Date:* June 5, 2025
*Participants:* Jen, Pierce, Rakesh, Mac, Brie, and others
*Context:* Discussion regarding the integration and tracking of SIT (System
Integration Testing) and UAT (User Acceptance Testing) activities using
Smartsheets and Capital Edge systems for an IT and business function
transformation project. The aim is to improve the process of monitoring,
updating, and reporting on application testing and readiness for go-live.
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Integration & Data Flow Between Smartsheets and
Capital Edge

   - *Background:*
   Capital Edge maintains a system inventory with data imported from
   Smartsheets. There is a sync mechanism, but the current structure and da=
ta
   mappings are under review to maximize efficiency.
   - *Discussion Points:*
      - Smartsheets organizes work plans by project, not application, which
      complicates one-to-one mapping with Capital Edge=E2=80=99s applicatio=
n inventory.
      - There is a partial mapping via project IDs, but real alignment for
      tracking requires matching at the application level (Athens App
IDs, etc.).
      - Capital Edge tracker needs to include more columns from
      Smartsheets, especially for SIT and UAT dates, testers, and other
      attributes to facilitate accurate status reporting.
      - There is a desire to avoid double entry of data by syncing as much
      as possible between Smartsheets and Capital Edge.

2. UAT Coordination and Status Tracking

   - *UAT Calendar and Roles:*
      - A consolidated SIT and UAT calendar exists, spanning key IT work
      streams: ERP, HR, Finance, Commercial, ISC, etc.
      - Lists of UAT coordinators, their roles, and IT counterparts are
      available, though gaps remain (specifically for test leads).
      - UAT coordinators are responsible for identifying testers, defining
      test scenarios, and securing sign-off from functional leads and spons=
ors.
   - *Dashboard Expectations:*
      - Dashboards should track:
         - Testers identified (status: complete/on-track/at-risk)
         - Scenarios defined and signed-off
         - Testing completion statuses by application and function.
      - Additional fields discussed:
         - Test scripts developed and uploaded to tools (like ALM/Jira)
         - Exit and entry criteria for milestones

3. Dashboard Design and Reporting

   - *Current State:*
      - Existing dashboards in Capital Edge (BRB dashboard) partially
      reflect SIT/UAT progress but lack certain automation and synchronizat=
ion.
      - Dashboards to be enhanced to display:
         - Number of apps/systems with completed SIT/UAT, delayed starts,
         at-risk statuses, and overall completion trajectory.
         - Time series view for planned vs. actual SIT/UAT and go-live
         events.
      - *Automation/Synchronization:*
      - Where applicable, data from Smartsheets should auto-populate
      Capital Edge dashboards to avoid duplication.
      - Some data (especially functional/BRB-driven) may require direct
      entry in Capital Edge.
      - Plan to build custom dashboards in Power BI using SQL queries
      connecting to Capital Edge, leveraging existing access and back-end
      capabilities.

4. Structure and Ownership of Data Updates

   - *Column Additions:*
      - Agreed to add columns for SIT start/end, UAT start/end, service
      owners, and other related fields into the Capital Edge system invento=
ry.
      - Mac will send a list of required columns.
   - *Responsibility for Updates:*
      - IT teams will update SIT/UAT milestones for the applications and
      projects they own.
      - Functions are expected to update BRB dashboard/statuses for UAT
      readiness.
      - Some effort is required to keep both Smartsheets and Capital Edge
      in sync until a robust mapping is established.
      - Data for ~294 applications in the inventory must be current;
      applies particularly to ~82 apps in SIT/UAT/go-live scope.
   - *Application/Function Alignment:*
      - Some apps may be touched by multiple functions (e.g., ERP by both
      Supply Chain and Finance), so multiple rows/views or flags may be nee=
ded.
      - The aim is to maintain a clean master inventory but allow
      functional splits for reporting.

5. Reporting and Visualization (Power BI & Capital Edge)

   - *Immediate Needs:*
      - Urgent requirement to deliver prototype/working dashboards for the
      meeting with Jeff on June 6, 2025.
      - Mockups or initial Power BI dashboards will be used for immediate
      management review, followed by more permanent dashboards in Capital E=
dge.
   - *Longer-Term Approach:*
      - Plan to engage the Capital Edge team to build robust, client-facing
      dashboards.
      - Data model to be established so Power BI dashboards can be
      developed via direct SQL connections for flexibility and rapid iterat=
ion.

6. Data Sync Mechanisms and Technical Notes

   - *Import/Export Approach:*
      - One-time data loads with all necessary columns followed by ongoing
      synchronization to keep Smartsheets and Capital Edge aligned.
      - WBS IDs, App IDs, and other unique keys are critical for mapping
      datasets for syncing statuses and milestones.
   - *Technical Ownership:*
      - Mac and IT team will handle initial build in Power BI.
      - Brie will coordinate with the Capital Edge team (specifically
      Brian) for backend sync and dashboard development.
      - The process includes matching and updating based on unique
      IDs=E2=80=94status fields especially.
      - Reporting needs (initial dashboard mockups, burn down/go-live
      views, etc.) will be shared with the Capital Edge technical team for
      implementation.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1. *Column Additions*
      - Mac to send the list of additional columns required in the Capital
      Edge inventory tracker.
      - IT/functional teams to specify any extra fields needed for their
      specific reporting.
   2. *Data Synchronization*
      - Prepare and execute a one-time upload of the full app inventory
      with all attributes and dates from Smartsheets/Capital Edge.
      - Verify mapping of App IDs, Project IDs, and WBS IDs across systems.
      - Explore/implement ongoing sync from Smartsheets to Capital Edge for
      SIT/UAT milestones and status.
   3. *Dashboard Preparation*
      - Prepare mockup or working dashboard in Power BI for the June 6
      meeting with Jeff, covering SIT/UAT progress and at-risk/delayed item=
s.
      - Verify underlying numbers in the dashboard before sharing with Jeff=
.
      - Begin work on more durable dashboards in Capital Edge, in parallel
      with temporary Power BI solutions.
   4. *Technical Coordination*
      - Brie to set up a call with Brian from Capital Edge to discuss data
      sync requirements and dashboard/report development.
      - Plan for Power BI SQL connectivity and dashboard creation, as
      needed.
   5. *Reporting Alignment*
      - Ensure that the reporting approach (Power BI, Capital Edge) meets
      client needs and supports both IT and functional status tracking.
      - Evaluate the feasibility of full automation for data flows and
      reporting to reduce manual updates.
   6. *Communication and Meetings*
      - Schedule and conduct the call with Pierce regarding UAT rollout and
      progress.
      - Prepare for the meeting with Jeff on June 6 with updated dashboards
      and reporting narratives.

------------------------------
Follow-up Points

   -

   *Confirm Mapping:*
   Need to verify if all required fields (App Name, IDs, status attributes)
   are present and mapped in both Smartsheets and Capital Edge before bulk
   data import.
   -

   *Dashboard Feedback:*
   After the June 6 meeting with Jeff, gather feedback on dashboard
   features/metrics and iterate accordingly.
   -

   *Future Syncs:*
   Confirm with Brian (Capital Edge) how additional fields/rows will be
   handled in subsequent syncs and whether automation can be enhanced.
   -

   *Clarify Role Assignments:*
   Finalize appointment of UAT test leads and ensure gaps in
   coordinator/tester assignments are closed.
   -

   *Reporting Model:*
   Decide whether reporting (especially function splits per app) will be
   done per row duplication in tracker or via flag/filter approaches.
   -

   *Handover to Capital Edge:*
   Evaluate readiness for full transition of dashboards from Power BI to
   native Capital Edge reporting once underlying data structure stabilizes.

------------------------------
Key Dates & Figures

   - *June 6, 2025:*
   Meeting with Jeff to present updated dashboards and project status.
   - *~294 Applications:*
   Total in the system inventory; current SIT/UAT focus on ~82 of these.
   - *Columns/Attributes to Add:*
   SIT Start/End, UAT Start/End, Service Owners, Testers Identified,
   Scenarios Defined, Testing Complete, Test Scripts Developed, Entry/Exit
   Criteria, etc.

------------------------------
Summary

This meeting was focused on aligning the IT and business functions on how
best to leverage Smartsheets and Capital Edge for unified tracking,
updating, and reporting of SIT/UAT readiness and go-live activities. Key
challenges remain in mapping data sources, reducing duplication, and
ensuring that the right stakeholders provide timely updates. There is
agreement to move quickly on dashboard prototypes for management oversight,
while investing in more robust, maintainable solutions in the client=E2=80=
=99s
primary systems moving forward.
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Mac0:10
Between Capital Edge and. Sorry, sorry. In smartsheets. And there's a sync
up between smartsheets and Capital Edge. I know there's a system inventory
in Capital Edge that is maintained with data imported from smartsheets. So
I'm wondering if there's an opportunity for us to just build back on.
Jen0:37
Or can you. I just wanted to hear.
Mac0:41
Ah, okay.
Jen0:42
So it doesn't echo.
Mac0:42
Yeah, yeah, Sorry to build back on. Give me a second. I'm just going to
change my headset here. Can you hear us?
Jen1:06
Very good.
Brie1:07
We're talking about setting up a call, Jen, with Pierce on kind of like the
rollout of UAT and things like that. And so part of it is like for the
coordinators, which we have a view on. And then what Rakesh was pulling up
is like illustrative dashboards to sort of monitor.
Pre1:23
Yeah.
Brie1:24
UAT progress.
Mac1:26
So a couple of things, Jen. On the call for Jeff tomorrow, we wanted to
share a few things. One, we've got a fairly consolidated view of the UAT
calendar SIT and UAT calendar across the key IT work streams.
Pre1:48
Okay.
Mac1:49
Erp, hr, finance, commercial, and I think one other isc. So we'll provide a
consolidated view of that that will be sort of memorialized and that's
what's published rather secondarily. We have a list of all of the names and
the roles. So who are the UAT coordinators? Who are the points of contact
that the functions gave us? Similarly, we have an IT list of IT names and
roles. What we do not, and there are some gaps, what we do not have is, you
know, from an IT perspective or from a business perspective, test leads. We
don't necessarily have test leads against, you know, we've got
coordinators, point of contacts for sub processes. We don't necessarily
have test lead names. And maybe that's something that the UAT coordinators
can define. Yeah. The third part is the dashboard he was asking for.
Jen2:48
Well, the test cases too, I think, like the number of test cases defined,
run, etc.
Mac2:57
Okay, right. But that's part of the scenario planning we should do. So
that's going to come up in the dashboard.
Jen3:02
Yeah.
Mac3:06
Agree.
Pre3:06
Yeah. I think the intent is for the UAT coordinators to be the one to be
responsible for identifying the, like the leaders for uat.
Brie3:18
We. So I should say we have it as a status. Right. So the UAE coordinator
will go in and say, like testers identified, like complete, on track, at
risk. Right, Right. Where do we have scenarios defined and signed off.
Pre3:32
Yeah.
Brie3:32
And then testing complete.
Mac3:34
Where do we have that?
Brie3:36
So that's in that BRB dashboard that we were talking about.
Pre3:40
Yeah. Because Jeff's keen on having the uat. He's got his head around the
fact that UAT may not. The scope of UAT testing may be very light in
certain cases. His view was he just wants. This is why we have it in the
tracker. So the UAT coordinator should be responsible for aligning and
driving what is, you know, what is the scope of UAT for that function. If
there is scope, you know, based on that, who are the testers? And then
getting the sign off from the functional lead and the, you know, the
functional sponsor on those scenarios and scope. Right.
Mac4:17
So, okay, so action item for us. We will go look at the BRB tracker that is
there in Capital Edge to get that, because that would be driven by UAT
coordinators. And do we have any dashboarding on that? Do we have any power
BI or anything that's being run on that.
Pre4:38
And stuff like that.
Mac4:40
So on this one.
Brie4:43
Sorry, I want to be clear, right? We need to first put into the BRB
dashboard the scope of systems and who is testing which functions are
testing those systems.
Pre4:59
Yeah.
Mac5:01
Yes, yes, yes. So go ahead.
Brie5:05
Separate from that. Right? What we were talking about here, what we were
talking about before Rakesh, around, what's in the capitalist work plan?
Right? Like someone went, so this is what's in the work plan. I think it's
a copy of what's in smartsheets.
Mac5:25
Which one is this?
Brie5:27
This is in the work plan.
Mac5:29
Okay.
Brie5:31
So I think this is a copy of what's in smartsheets and I think it's like,
based on like the project, not specifically applications. This is in the
work plan.
Pre5:41
Okay.
Brie5:42
And so each of these like, does have milestones around. This one doesn't.
Each of these has milestones around testing. This one's more onboarding, so
probably doesn't. So there is like a way to kind of tap. We can run it, run
a process to tag milestones in this plan and then build the dashboard that
you were like sharing can. Like, that's impossible.
Mac6:12
It is. Now this is at a work plan level. So if you go to the BRV module.
Brie6:18
Yeah.
Mac6:19
And look at the in. Yeah. So in it you should have a view of, if you click
it, is it the systems? So you have a view of the 290+ apps here.
Pre6:34
Here.
Brie6:35
Yeah.
Mac6:36
Now we may need to add, we may need to add a few more columns here, but we
can get the service owners, for example, added in here. The UAT POCs are
there but we can add in dates here for sit dates that we've got from the
functions or the work streams, the UAT dates and you know, our dashboard.
Can we add those rows in here to say, you know, SIT start, UAD start, you
know, delayed.
Pre7:03
Okay, I think that would be good.
Brie7:05
That's fine. Yeah, that's totally fine. So our intention is for the
functions to come in and like so for Blackline Finance would come in and
they would set, they would say whether the testers have been identified,
the scenarios have been defined and signed off and then whether the testing
is complete and what the team, the Capital Edge team is working on right
now. Let me see if I can open this. We don't, we still, most of the apps
are still pointing to it by the way. So we do need that like function
mapping to like identify which functions are like responsible for testing
which applications. But once we have that built out, it gets pulled into
this report and what Capital Edge has on their bucket for this week is on
the systems row where it says cutover. We're going to split it into three
rows similar to how process is split between hiring and knowledge transfer.
Systems will be split between like the three things that we talked about.
Testers identified, scenarios defined and signed off and testing complete.
Mac8:30
Okay. Testers identify scenarios defined and signed off, testing complete.
Now, now for may be a little bit more that we need. For example, test
scripts have been developed. There's more tactical stuff around. Okay. The
scenarios have been sorted out. Have the test scripts been generated? Have
they been loaded in ALM or jira? All that other details and then the
milestone, the end my exit entry criteria defined, all the other IT related
stuff that is going to result in that milestone that says testing completed
and you're only doing uat correct?
Pre9:14
Yes.
Mac9:14
Okay.
Pre9:15
Yes, yes. So what was before you go off of this though on that one? I guess
what we would. What we're rolling into for the functions and crazy me
honest here the IT will, they will, it'll. It will be the UAT test
scenarios, the UAT testing complete cut over and that's what the, the
business or the functional or UAT coordinators would need to update those
statuses, those columns or whatever status is in the tracker.
Mac9:42
Okay.
Pre9:43
I think that now if you go to the tracker, sorry the systems piece in the
tracker now I think if there are adding additional columns here Rakesh, I
think it's fine. And then it would be the it, whoever the appropriate IT
owner is to update those.
Mac10:01
Correct.
Pre10:01
And then you can run Whatever kind of. We can do. Whatever kind of what?
Whatever you need for the dashboard, then you can do that. Right.
Jen10:09
Are they still expected to update the smartsheets with their work plans and
the dates and then. So they're expected to update some columns in the
smartsheet with their work plans and then some of the columns directly in
this tracker.
Pre10:25
So here's a question for you. So if they are what they're updating and
smart, and this probably may have been more pre. You were going in the
beginning. Was that. So what's coming. What our understanding is the work
plan tab is getting updated based on what the input is in smartsheets. So
if that data is coming through that way and it's just a matter of
combining, we don't need to duplicate it. Right.
Brie10:51
I think the problem is that the way smartsheets is organized right now is
not by application.
Mac10:55
Correct, correct. That's the problem.
Brie11:00
They're going to have to update some things no matter what.
Pre11:02
Yeah. Unless you've got a mapping. They are. Yeah.
Mac11:06
So I think.
Pre11:08
But you might actually have a mapping though, because see how you've got.
You might want to check this. Right. Because see what we have in the work
plan coming from smartsheets. I think the project ID is coming in and so.
And I also think you have the project Project ID and the app inventory were
cached. So if that mapping is right, then you could still do it, right?
Mac11:33
Yes. I just don't know if it's me, though. So, you know, like in ERP hr.
Yeah, fair enough. Like er. So like erp, there's an ERP project id and
that's on the logical le. Operationalization of the erp. But you're gonna
have IT touch supply chain finance at the minimum, and so you won't
necessarily have. If I'm following your logic, supply chain is going to
have to react to that project ID or that app and then finance will also
react to the same project ID and app.
Pre12:15
That's right. That's right. So I'm talking purely for the it. So whoever
just said so, we're going to make it go in and update both smartsheets and
then do the same thing in the capital Edge from an if the IT update. Right.
Is that they're doing in smartsheets. Right. If it's the same update.
Right. If the data. If it. You know, if it's mapping, then. Then you can do
an automate. We don't have to ask that person to do it twice. Right.
Mac12:44
Understood.
Pre12:44
We have to.
Mac12:45
Unfortunately I don't.
Pre12:48
We do have to have the function still go into the system tracker, right?
Brie12:52
Yes. But the functions are familiar with the BRB dashboard.
Pre12:57
That's right.
Brie12:58
Like we have, you know, we need to get them kind of focused in on uat. But
yeah, I don't think that like they're kind of, you know, having these
offline discussions with. In any case, they understand that they have a
role to play. This is sort of kind of getting them, you know, to provide
status on it, which is fine.
Mac13:22
So what I, what I'm going to need. So what I'm going to need then is. So
what I'm going to need them pre is on this tracker. So I'm, I'm the.
Unfortunately, we don't have all 294 apps in the projects in here. There
are a lot of live withouts. Everything else, so build back live without
tsa. So anything that is truly. Here's my. The complexity, obviously the
critical for le, go Live, brv, that needs to be updated. We will go in and
update it. For every 290 app here, 294, what we will need to add is a
couple of columns around, you know, sit, start, end delayed and all those.
So, you know, because what I would like to do is yes, at some point it
either the test leads or at least for sit, you know, the web stream leads
or the UAT coordinator will come in here from an IT perspective. Peers or
his designate will come in here and update. Okay, SIT has started. SIT is
delayed. SIT is, you know, at risk and we can run those dashboards off of
that to what Jeff wants to say. Okay, here's the progress. Here's sort of,
you know, there's. There's 40 apps that have gone through sit. There are
seven apps that have started UAT. Yeah, I think that view is what I, you
know. So going back to the dashboard that Mac was sharing a bit earlier, I
think it would be helpful if we build it on top of this. Wherever we can
automate and feed in from smartsheets, we will. But we probably need a
couple more columns here. A few more columns on sit. Start end, UAT start
end.
Brie15:16
Yeah, we have UAT start end. We can. Adding columns takes prime literally
three seconds.
Pre15:21
Okay.
Mac15:21
Yeah.
Pre15:21
Okay, yeah, yeah.
Mac15:23
So then how are doing that?
Pre15:25
Can you add a couple of those other like informative like those columns
from the app inventory pre that are a little bit more like that. What is
the app name? Those ones that I kind of pulled in into that spreadsheet.
Brie15:35
We did ask them to do it.
Mac15:36
So we can, we can give you the list of the other columns. We need it added.
Brie15:43
Yeah.
Mac15:43
And okay, if it's just two seconds we can send you those and then you can
help us. Adam?
Brie15:48
Yeah, I think the question.
Mac15:50
Okay. And then the question is how quickly can we run. So for tomorrow's
conversation, our talk track is going to be that we're going to maintain
the system inventory here or at least the tracker for UAT readiness sit UAT
here. We'll run dashboards out of this and the mock up of the dashboard
that will be a representation of this will be what Mac has. But I do get
your point in that there will be two points, for example, in the work
plans. They're going to update their sit dates, but they're going to
probably come here and update. Somebody will have to update the sit dates
as well. Maybe that's a one time effort.
Pre16:36
Yeah, I mean if Pierce's line of sight into. Yeah, I mean if you forgot if
the dates are already like they're set those columns and then upload,
adding, you know, doing a bulk like upload, I think that we can do to once
the columns are there.
Jen16:48
Okay, I could get them that and.
Pre16:50
Then if it's sort of centralized to peers as far as updating the status.
Mac16:53
Okay. Okay. So I think that we can approach, I'll mention the approach
tomorrow on the dashboards and we'll say we'll leverage this. We're going
to update this inventory with some columns for sid, UAT service owners and
other fields and then we'll be able to run reporting on this to reflect
that sort of a dashboard. Matt, if you can pull that dashboard, is there
anything you see missing here or you want to add in? Jen? So if you go back
to he's sharing the dashboard, there are a couple of dashboards that I want
to show him tomorrow. The first one being more of an execution dashboard.
How many SIT UAT completed, how many delayed starts, what is at risk, what
is on track, meaning there's some sort of a percentage or a calculation on
against the end date and then things that are not started. And what you see
at the bottom is a stack of sitcount and UAT count. We can flip that. We
should flip it. Meaning I will have across the timeline a time series view
of this and saying, okay, in this particular date I'm expecting to have 50
sits completed and 10 UADs completed. Or in fact we could say if there's,
if it's in progress, we could say, you know, either Progress planned or
completed? We can choose in here and say okay, you know, here's the. If we
say planned, we say okay, on July 1st, we've got, you know, 23 sits or 33
sits planned and 23 UATs planned. Does this resonate with you?
Pre18:56
Yeah, I mean so when we say UAT completed, that's going to be. Because
what. In the dashboard, it'll be. It's going to be like by, you know, app
or by. I guess we'll end up adding rows for each function.
Mac19:08
Right. And those numbers, those numbers won't be the same. The, the second
row is not going to be the same as the first row. We have to get some
realistic numbers.
Jen19:17
Those are the real numbers.
Mac19:19
Huh?
Jen19:20
Those are the real numbers based on their smartsheet plans right now.
Pre19:25
So sick completed though. But is that. So if we just. If we complete 64. Is
64 the number of apps or.
Jen19:35
The number of like the number of systems that have Systems?
Mac19:39
Okay, so 82 is. This is all system. So this is from the inventory view.
We'll. We'll say there's 82 systems that are BRV and non BRV starting in
June, going all the way to October 1st.
Pre19:54
And then, then you would have the data then in the, in the, in the
dashboard it looks like. Because that's just status for each. Right. So if
you add this columns.
Mac20:02
Correct. Can you go back.
Jen20:03
Yeah, sorry. Yep, exactly.
Mac20:09
Can you.
Jen20:10
Yeah.
Mac20:11
So yeah, the intent is we want to build this and automated on top of the
Capital Edge if we can.
Pre20:19
Yeah. So there's two ways. I mean there's, I think the columns. Adding the
columns of the data. There is a pretty quick one. So the pre. Was
mentioning talking to Brian developing the custom reports through Capital
Edge. There's a quick. And then depending can be kind of quick way. So you
can do custom sort of. We have custom analytics in there. So custom
dashboards in Power Bi and exposing them into. Through the custom analytics
app is doable. And then you just connect and it's just a SQL query to pull
the data. Okay. How provisionary. How good are you with Power bi?
Jen21:00
I built them on top of smart sheets before. I've built them on top of smart
streets before.
Mac21:09
And then.
Brie21:09
Cool.
Pre21:10
Okay, so then you're fine. I mean I wouldn't call myself proficient, but
I've managed to do a couple.
Jen21:13
But exactly.
Pre21:14
Because then where I'm going is that I've got access to the back end and so
I would just write the C SQL query to connect to Power bi. Then you can do
what you want from there.
Jen21:23
That would be great if you could write the SQL query to connect to Power
bi. I can build on top of it.
Pre21:31
Awesome. Okay, so then.
Mac21:32
Yeah, and then the second one is. The second one was more of a cutover burn
down, go live for systems as well. I don't like this. I want the histogram.
Yeah, but this is a view of. Yeah, go live. Go live planned. Go live
actual. So this would be more of a burn down. Actually this is. Yes. So
more like this pre. This is our JJ example but you know, of. Of actual
versus planned.
Brie22:06
This is a task count or like apps that are cut over apps.
Mac22:16
So from a systems perspective, we've got the 20/BRB apps and then you've
got the other move as is and build back apps that are 50 or 60. So those
add up to the 82. So if he's wanting a view of UAT and cutover views or go
lives, this is from an inventory systems inventory perspective. Progress on
SIT UAT and then progress on go lives.
Jen22:46
What's the level of detail? That example that you shared with the report, I
really liked that because it had the related, like process items and it
looked like it was a count of or a sum of 10 tasks. Is that correct? It
looked like there was a KT for F, like a number of tasks for KT for Finance
or. Yeah, and I think that that's where it would be helpful to leverage.
How are those like classified? Like, are they tagged manually as kt, for
example.
Pre23:25
That'S the process tracker Capital Edge.
Jen23:29
Got it.
Mac23:30
So they're not system tracker.
Brie23:32
Yeah, it's not tech, it's system, I would say.
Pre23:34
Right.
Mac23:34
Yeah, it's. It's process for. Have I hired, has finance hired the right
five people?
Jen23:40
Yeah.
Mac23:41
Have I done KT for those five people?
Jen23:43
Yeah, but they're not, they're not linked to the.
Mac23:46
It won't be the first system because it's a. Can I, can I file? Can I. HR
will do the same.
Jen23:52
Yeah.
Mac23:52
Can I hire five people and that can manage a payroll? Yeah, it's not. I'm
going to Oracle to manage this. Okay. So.
Pre24:00
Yeah, so but to your point though, right, so like in the process tracker,
right, we have, you know, they've done all this mapping, right. So and then
this is why the functions are already doing this. But they are, they're
updating sort of the knowledge transfer. They're not really doing these
ones in an overall process. And then we pull in hiring status and they,
they did, we did have functions the mapping to roles. Right. But in the
systems tracker right we. We have a swag of like you wouldn't do. You
wouldn't tie systems to a process. That would be silly. You would. We can
do like Bina, you know function and you can get pretty close to sub
function. Not necessarily from this, with this part. This is map of sub
function here just from a column. But like there's other. I think there's
like cm some service sort of category. There's additional fields in the app
inventory that would get right closer. But for that what the report out
that Pre was showing that that's being pulled the systems piece, it's going
to be pulled in by the function. I think what we have to do is like some of
these like for ERP like instead of just having it to it. There's many.
There will be. We'll need to split this into the. Yeah. Into seven
different rows.
Mac25:15
Are you going to do that in the system. Are you going to do that in the
system inventory tracker, Jen, or is that elsewhere? Because I'd like to
keep it to 294 the systems. If I'm tracking here I'd like to keep it the
same. The one that you and Pre were mentioning about say finances, finance,
sub processes touching erp. I don't know, let's say in July the supply
chain logistics team is touching ERP in end of June. So that conversation I
would, I would.
Pre25:48
Figure out how we do it then because like. Yeah, yeah, because for this one
like for. It's gonna be one person that's identifying that's doing the kind
of like sit when you have those columns in. But for uatp, you know it. It's
more than one.
Mac26:05
Yeah.
Pre26:08
And so I think probably to make it work we probably still do need to split
it. But then for the IT view, like as long as we have a row that has
function it.
Mac26:18
Okay then we might.
Pre26:20
We should be able to kind of filter it out for reporting first. I don't
know.
Mac26:24
Yeah.
Brie26:25
So I guess will it update all 200 and something like for the dates and like
the completion and what have you.
Mac26:35
Yeah. So this is the other piece. Right. So the 300 is the universe of
apps. 100 of them are live without and technically speaking we may have to
remove them from here. There's about 100 that are in TSA and so we'll have
to see if there's you know, logical separation work or you know, access
control that's being done by day one. So there'll maybe there's no SIT uat.
There's just that and then there's the move as is and the build backs which
are about 80, actually about 60 plus the 25 or so 22 BRB apps, legal entity
related changes. So those all will be in here. So our ask or at least from
an IT perspective the sit and the UAT will be just on those 82 apps.
Pre27:27
Yeah.
Mac27:29
So the challenge then for you I see is. And this is what we're discovering
like we did pre with the supply chain team or gen is you know, Sriram has,
you know, from an IT perspective he's saying okay, IT supply chain is. Is
having let's say 10 build back and five move as is. Okay. That's. That will
be listed here as 15 apps that it supply chain promote and that team will
go in and update or, or pierce with. But Sriram has only a subset of those
and potentially some new ones that he's going to touch as part of the
supply chain process. So yeah, how do we track those?
Brie28:14
We can use the function column to just manage it. So like all of your
dashboards that we've been talking about will be driven off of like it
because it will have the full 2, 200 whatever applications.
Mac28:27
Okay.
Brie28:27
And then the functions that are test are testing UAT for BRB will those
will be tagged to their function and we'll just have to like filter those
out.
Mac28:40
Okay, so what you're saying is here, if I interpret this, Sriram is
touching that Mentor Graphics, which is a build back app in engineering
that he's going to be touching that as part of his UAT process.
Pre29:00
Yeah. So the ones that are clearly like this, right. So that clearly have a
function alignment. This is you know how it is in the, even in the app
inventory. Right. For him to go in and to provide, you know, as a UAT
coordinator he will update the status on UAT scenarios, testers, you know
the. And whoever from it. When you add in the SIT ones will do those.
Right. Where it becomes different as we know, right. Is when you look at
the BRB and I think this is what I heard you say bro. Like being before if
you look at erp, right? Where is it here? If we split this and so it only
we split this into separate rows. 11 this one that says keep the IT here
and then also have one for finance, one for isc.
Mac29:48
Isc yeah, one for yeah, hr.
Pre29:51
Then then they do it. Then they can update those. Right. We can carry over
any of the IT specific. So I think that updating multiple and then Whatever
dashboards you have. We would use the function filter.
Mac30:03
Okay. Okay.
Pre30:04
We could just add some sort of flag so that we don't end up. You know what
I mean?
Mac30:09
That makes sense then. Okay, so not 296. You could end up with 1000 rows
but we'll only filter for the 296 its.
Pre30:19
Probably want to do. So we keep an actual app count Is that. I actually
think it'd be. You can do it either we probably. You can add a flag if you
want but you can dedupe it when you pull it from SQL on like system name or
something.
Brie30:33
Hey I guess like the maintenance is like. So I guess like in Smartsheets or
wherever is there. Are we intending for this tracker to also track when SIT
is complete?
Mac30:54
Yes, because at an app level who will provide that? That would be. So
that's the other piece is because Smartsheets doesn't have it at an app
level. They have periods for some of the apps. Yes but we don't necessarily
have like supply chain is not tracking it as you know. I have 37 apps.
Maybe they are. We have to go back and look. If they are updating it in
Smartsheets in their work plans then it would be easy for pull to
automatically update it against this ID name. Our ID and name. So all that
82 applications in scope for sit UAT those 8080 plus 82 whatever it lands.
It would be preferable if we can do an update or a sync from smartsheet
work plans directly in here for sit. UAT dates for those.
Pre31:54
Can we just look at what data?
Jen31:56
Yeah, let me show you.
Mac31:57
Yeah. So let's take a look at smartsheets.
Pre32:00
And.
Jen32:04
So this is the heat map in smartsheet and then I can show you the
underlying data as well.
Mac32:09
Okay, so why don't we go. What's on the right is. So you've got. So this is
definitely.
Jen32:20
Yeah, so we have everything.
Mac32:22
So again I think this needs to be kept up to date in the work plan.
Jen32:26
This is from the work plans.
Mac32:28
Okay.
Jen32:29
So the underlying work plans.
Pre32:30
So in theory this is also being fed into the capital edge work plan.
Mac32:34
Correct. Correct. Only the milestones though which I think are situat
milestone because there's other piece of this where it says build test and
we have to go back to the work plan and see if we have specifically SIT
testing. UAT testing.
Pre32:55
You do for some. I don't think we do for.
Mac32:56
Not for all. But if we do pull this in, given that there's a Sync, we can
pull this sit start, sit end from the work plans, from this sync page and
move it into. Into that tracker up there.
Pre33:13
Yeah. I mean, it can be either. Right. Like if you've got the data in
smartsheets and you want, you know, in for whatever's cleaner. Right. So
like if the. From an IT perspective, the IT team is up. Is keeping
smartsheets up to date and therefore. And then we sync that. We sync with
smartsheets into Capital Edge, be it the work plan, IT work plan sync or in
the tracker. Right. It doesn't really matter. Right. And then for the
functional BRB updates where you kind of become creating separate rows and
do all that, we don't need to sync it in two places. You can only sync it
in one and you can do the same thing.
Mac33:54
Right.

 are seven apps that have started UAT. Yeah, I think that view is what I, y=

 I think it would be helpful if we build it on top of this. Wherever we can=
 automate and feed in from smartsheets, we will. But we probably need a cou=

Okay. Okay. So I think that we can approach, I&#39;ll mention the approach =
tomorrow on the dashboards and we&#39;ll say we&#39;ll leverage this. We&#3=
9;re going to update this inventory with some columns for sid, UAT service =
owners and other fields and then we&#39;ll be able to run reporting on this=
 to reflect that sort of a dashboard. Matt, if you can pull that dashboard,=
 is there anything you see missing here or you want to add in? Jen? So if y=
ou go back to he&#39;s sharing the dashboard, there are a couple of dashboa=
rds that I want to show him tomorrow. The first one being more of an execut=
ion dashboard. How many SIT UAT completed, how many delayed starts, what is=
 at risk, what is on track, meaning there&#39;s some sort of a percentage o=
r a calculation on against the end date and then things that are not starte=
d. And what you see at the bottom is a stack of sitcount and UAT count. We =
can flip that. We should flip it. Meaning I will have across the timeline a=
 time series view of this and saying, okay, in this particular date I&#39;m=
 expecting to have 50 sits completed and 10 UADs completed. Or in fact we c=
ould say if there&#39;s, if it&#39;s in progress, we could say, you know, e=
ither Progress planned or completed? We can choose in here and say okay, yo=
u know, here&#39;s the. If we say planned, we say okay, on July 1st, we&#39=
;ve got, you know, 23 sits or 33 sits planned and 23 UATs planned. Does thi=
s resonate with you?</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16=
