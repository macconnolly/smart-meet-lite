Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 16, 2025
------------------------------

   - Jessica (facilitator)
   - Rakesh
   - Vicki
   - Monica (AI/Test Automation, not present)
   - Asha (Test Automation)
   - Bill (ERP Team)
   - Avinash

   access and input)

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed
------------------------------
1. *UAT/Folder Structure and Organization*

   - *Jessica* established an *Athens UAT site* with a draft =E2=80=9CDefec=
t Intake
   Planner=E2=80=9D and proposed folder organization.
   - *Discussion on Folder Design:*
      - Initial idea: Folders by business function or by team, with
      indications for BRV-critical and BRV-adjacent functions/applications.
      - *Feedback from Team:*
         - Some business functions (e.g., Data & Intelligence) are not
         directly touched for BRV (Build Release Vehicle), but might
be BRV-adjacent
         (consume information but do not change).
         - Suggestion to separate BRV and Non-BRV tracks at the highest
         folder level for clarity.
         - Within BRV: Organize primarily by process (e.g., order-to-cash,
         procure-to-pay), not system.
         - For end-to-end process testing, map as a business scenario
         (crossing multiple systems/workstreams).
         - For Non-BRV: Keep system-level folders, as these are typically
         about application migrations/=E2=80=9Clift and shift=E2=80=9D even=
ts.
         - Decision: For BRV, have top-level folders by process and also
         three IT workstream folders (ERP, Finance, HR) for functional test=
s.
         - Reviewed the need for clarity between end-to-end process testing
         vs. functional testing within each business function.
         - Highlighted the challenge of tracking =E2=80=9Cadjacent=E2=80=9D=
 systems
         (downstream data/reporting that is not physically changing).
      - *Non-BRV Folder Logic:*
         - Every system (including those not BRV-critical) gets a folder in
         Non-BRV.
         - For HR and Finance (where only some systems are BRV-critical),
         systems are split across BRV and Non-BRV.

------------------------------
2. *System and Process Testing Clarifications*

   - *End-to-End vs. Functional Tests:*
      - End-to-end test scripts will cross multiple systems; folders
      organized around business processes.
      - Functional scripts are specific to ERP, Finance, HR =E2=80=93 place=
d in
      their respective folders.
      - Confirmed there are five primary end-to-end processes for BRV.
      - For Non-BRV, focus is on each application=E2=80=99s migration (with=
 process
      scripts less relevant).
   - *Data & Intelligence / Reporting:*
      - No direct changes for BRV =E2=80=94 these systems are only consumer=
s for
      validation downstream.
      - Manual reports versus automated reports discussed: majority are
      manual, so minimal reconfiguration/testing required at the source sys=
tem
      level.

------------------------------
3. *Schedule, Reporting, and Use of TOSCA Tool*

   - *Schedule Tracking:*
      - For BRV: UAT and SIT timelines are condensed (roughly 2=E2=80=934 w=
eeks).
      - For Non-BRV: Testing and migration are staggered between July and
      October, each team manages their own schedule.
      - Each folder to include a =E2=80=98Schedule=E2=80=99 subfolder for t=
eam-specific
      plans.
      - Team agreed schedule may be redundant with what TOSCA tracks, but
      will keep until clarity is achieved.
   - *Reporting:*
      - Desired: Daily reporting available for test progress (# of scripts
      run, pass/fail counts, % complete, defect status).
      - Discussed whether there already exists a standard reporting
      template.
   - *TOSCA Use:*
      - TOSCA, an automation tool, will be used for SIT and potentially UAT=
.
      - For SIT, automation team runs, business validates outputs if needed=
.
      - UAT: Debate over level of involvement=E2=80=94do business users exe=
cute
      scripts directly, or only review/validate TOSCA-generated results?
      - Outstanding questions on TOSCA=E2=80=99s reporting capability, acce=
ss, and
      business user interaction.

------------------------------
4. *Meeting Cadence, Communications, and Operating Rhythm (MOS)*

   - *Daily Scrum/Syncs:*
      - Team consensus: Each function/process to have daily targeted
      =E2=80=9Cscrum=E2=80=9D calls instead of lengthy all-hands.
      - Scrum calls to follow a clear format: what was scheduled,
      completed, blockers/issues, and next steps.
      - For end-to-end processes (BRV), have process-lead-specific daily
      calls. For Non-BRV, more function-specific if appropriate.
   - *Escalation:*
      - Escalation path to be clarified: issues arising between scheduled
      meetings need immediate elevation (not just at weekly OpSec/leadershi=
p
      reviews).
   - *Weekly and Leadership Reporting:*
      - Weekly status consolidation is needed for executive/SteerCo
      oversight.
      - Wednesday reporting cadence referenced.
   - *MOS Document Updates:*
      - Reviewed the existing slide, made edits to clarify daily vs. weekly
      meetings, escalation paths, and expectations for participants
and reporting.

------------------------------
5. *Access Management and Stakeholder Lists*

   - Discussion of giving appropriate access to the Team Site folders.
   - IT leads, function leads, project managers to be added first;
   iterative process as more tester names are provided.
   - HR example: List of 26-country testers for ADP Payroll, to be included
   as provided by Sandra.
   - Action to create a master RACI/contact list to maintain an up-to-date
   record of participants, owners, and roles, accessible on the Team Site.

------------------------------
6. *Trackers and Readiness*

   - Tracker files for BRV and Non-BRV are maintained in Excel.
      - Each tracker includes workstream leads, test resources, planned
      SIT/UAT dates, environment access, testing status, etc.
   - The tracker will be posted on the Team Site for reference and
   population.
   - Tracker is the source for readiness tracking and may be leveraged for
   reporting and contact management.
   - Goal: By end of week, have a completed tracker for both BRV and
   Non-BRV to support reporting (Friday, June 20, 2025, as reference).

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Folder Structure Finalization*
   - Jessica to finalize the folder structure according to the agreed
      BRV/Non-BRV split, and by process for BRV.
      - Rename/update as needed based on today=E2=80=99s feedback.

reams for BRV.
   2.

   *Access List Creation*
   - Create a contact list (RACI) of all participants (leads, owners,
      testers) for Team Site access.
      - Each function lead/accountable person to update/add their
      respective users and testers as names are gathered (e.g., Sandra
for HR/ADP
      countries).
      - Ongoing: Update as new testers are identified during the rollout.
   3.

   *BRV/Non-BRV Tracker Upload*
   - Rakesh to upload both readiness trackers (BRV, Non-BRV) to the Team
      Site.
      - Teams to update these trackers promptly (BRV within next 1=E2=80=93=
2 days;
      Non-BRV by end of week).
   4.

   *Review and Update Meeting/MOS Cadence*
   - Review and edit the MOS (Management Operating System) document to
      include:
         - Daily functional/process scrums.
         - Escalation processes.
         - Weekly status consolidation call.

      Rakesh, Vicki).
   5.

   *Clarify Use of TOSCA*
   - Rapidly confirm:
         - Which teams and testing phases TOSCA will be used for (SIT only
         or also UAT).
         - Who has/needs access (Jessica to pursue access via Monica/Asha).
         - How reporting will be extracted, and whether business users will
         have hands-on interaction with TOSCA.
         - Determine if the =E2=80=9CDefect Intake Planner=E2=80=9D is stil=
l required if
         TOSCA is end-to-end; revisit process as needed.
      6.

   *Reporting Template/Expectations*
   - Define, document, and communicate the daily reporting expectations
      (template/timing/who compiles).
      - Specify whether this comes from TOSCA or is tracked elsewhere.
      - Ensure reporting expectations are clear to business and IT leads.
   7.

Summary Statement

The meeting focused on finalizing a structured, scalable approach to UAT
coordination for Athens, splitting scope between BRV and Non-BRV testing.
Key outputs include agreement on process-centric folders for BRV, the
use/discussion of TOSCA for automated testing, the introduction of daily
functional and process scrums, and a drive to clarify reporting, access,
and readiness tracking within the week. Rapid action is required on points
of tool use, reporting, and folder population to meet condensed project
timelines.

=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Jessica0:00
Hearing Mickey Mouse in the background.
Rakesh0:08
Can Mickey Mouse do a uat?
Jessica0:12
He can probably UAT his Mickey Mouse clubhouse, but beyond that. All right,
Mickey did not get back to me. So let's just get started and I'm sure when
she's able to join us, she will. She's not showing as available, showing
her offline. So I don't know if something came up, but here's what I did so
far. I created an Athens UAT site. I created the. I'm calling it a defect
Intake planner for now. We can review this with everyone if we need more
buckets. Although I just realized it didn't. Oh no, it did tape. Okay,
sorry, I thought it missed something that I put on there. So here's what I
was thinking. If we don't like this direction, let me know. We can move it
around. But I think that we need to have a folder per team. I think it'll
be better to focus on the folder for. I'm sorry, business function maybe is
the best way to say that. Per business function. And then within each
folder have these folders I have down here in green, but I have also
highlighted here in red the folders of the teams that have a BRV critical
application.
Rakesh1:33
So. Okay, now.
Jessica1:38
I don't think it's modifiable. This is just.
Rakesh1:40
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, to start with, I think it's. Yes,
it's a start. I think my. Yeah, so folder structure, I think not every
function or work stream is for brv.
Vicki1:53
So.
Rakesh1:54
And when you say for, I just need to maybe double click into how you're
thinking about the folder structure. So for example, supply chain is going
to have end to end processes, say order to cash. That will involve some
commercial systems, some supply chain systems, some finance systems, etc.
So how would we. So on this, let's say on this slide, you see that the BRV
from a systems perspective, it's hr, finance and supply chain fundamentally
foundationally changing. Now, the BRV at adjacents are the other systems
that they'll touch as part of their testing. So how do we want to then
track it? Because let's say, I give you. Let's say as part of this, they
look at some downstream reports. So they need to use Snowflake to look at
it. And so Data and intelligence is another work stream, but there's
nothing changing in data and intelligence for 8.1. So how do we want to
track that? Maybe that's not an answer for now, but I don't know if we want
to put it from. Because we bifurcated this into BRV and non brv. So this
structure will be very good for non brv where you actually have the
migrations of applications that will have to go through SIT and uat.
Jessica3:22
So let me ask this because I was trying to. This is really the most
information I have so far is the presentation you sent over.
Rakesh3:32
Yes.
Jessica3:32
So I followed this with the understanding that some of these items are BRV
critical. But to your point, let me think I will say this. So the ones that
are these are directly BRV critical and then let's call them BRV adjacent
or like you said, isc. Are they identified in a file like this or is it
that one of these specific.
Rakesh4:02
Okay, they are this. This is just a subset that we took to say these are
the purely. But we have a list of. So we have a readiness tracker and a non
BRV readiness tracker. We should put both of those excels here for
readiness tracker once people populate. And we can track it here. That has
the laundry list of the 40 applications or so for BRV. These 14 plus the
adjacents.
Jessica4:30
So give me that list because that to your point, may change how we do this.
I don't know if it's adding in more folders or if it's really just
highlighting the BRV adjacent ones, maybe in a different color to say, hey,
the red are critical and then the orange are BRV adjacent. I was just
trying to. Two things here. One is I want to make sure that whatever we're
doing for brv, we're doing for non BRV just to be consistent, but also want
to make sure we're not missing something. So having it all in one spot and
starting to get everyone up to speed, even if they're not VRV critical,
just more for them, having awareness I think will be helpful. Big picture.
So agree. You have that list. Send it over. Let's take a look. Is it like
ISC for example, is on here? But would there be more business functions?
Rakesh5:26
So here. Well, so business functions I can't.
Jessica5:33
So like I guess what my question. I know I'm not asking it. Well, no, no,
no, no, no.
Rakesh5:37
I think you're on the right track.
Jessica5:38
So just highlighting that a couple more of these are BRD adjacent or is.
Rakesh5:43
It actually adding more folders because there's nothing happening for an
adjacent. So I think at a parent level we should have. My suggestion is we
have two separate tracks, one BRV and one non BRV or day one.
Jessica5:56
Okay, okay.
Rakesh5:57
And then underneath that the question is how do you want to structure that?
So if it is for brv, we have some subset of functions involved and we have
a list of the core 14 apps that are physically getting changes like the ERP
system, like the finance systems, like the HR systems. And then we have a
subset called the other adjacents like databases or Tableau reporting or
you know, Snowflake or some of these others commercial that are touched
where when they run these end to end test scripts, they're touching other
systems. So I think the structure will depend on what we want to house in
these folders. So in that scenario, for example, let's just pick on data
and Intelligence. They're going to be looking at downstream reports in
Tableau or Snowflake to make sure that all their end to end. When they run
the scenarios and end to end scripts, one of the outcomes would be okay, I
can create an order entry, I can run it through the SAP system, I can
create a purchase order, I'm able to pull off some downstream reports of
analysts, analytics, etc. So there won't be any changes to data and
intelligence. It's just consumed as part of the exercise for brp.
Jessica7:31
Can I ask a question there? So the ERP is changing instances, right?
Rakesh7:40
For legal, not instances? No, no, no. They're logical entity, legal entity
changes happening within the instance.
Jessica7:48
Okay, so, and I'm not an IT person, so I may not be the right way, but I'm
following what you're saying. So from the data side, specifically, let's
say tableau, right now, they have reports that are built in tableau that
are pointing back to some data from the ERP system. When they change, when
they make these updates in the ERP system, is there any update at all? Even
if it's minor and it's just, hey, I need to point to this instance versus
that instance. Is there any change at all on the data side?
Rakesh8:23
Only on the data, an intelligent site, not for this test. It's a downstream
consumer of. Not to my understanding. Yeah, they may. So let's say the
address changes or the legal entity changes and they run a report of an
output form or something. They may show that the address has changed in
some analytics report. So there's no changes in the data and intelligence
systems for this. But it is being used.
Jessica8:59
I get it, but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to figure out the better
way to ask because like we have, we mostly use power bi, but our power BIS
are also part of it. Yep, yeah, some are manual that hey, I get, I just
receive an Extract from it, I put it in. And in those cases I see where
your point of it's not really updated because the extract, instead of
coming from instance A, comes from instance B. The person who pulls the
extract is going to give me some B that I. Jessica, as this secondary user
or the downstream user of that data. I don't need to do anything different
because I'm still getting my extract. So those instances, I agree and I
understand what you're saying. What I'm trying to connect the dots in my
head is for ones where there's maybe like an automated report and maybe
there aren't any. But are there any instances where the data is extracted
automatically and there is at least one connection point update to say,
hey, instead of you getting the data from instance A, you're getting it
from B and you just need to test that connection point?
Rakesh10:07
Not in this case, not for the ERP systems.
Jessica10:10
Okay, so they're all manual inputs then from ERP to like let's say in my
analogy right now. Tableau.
Rakesh10:18
Well, existing inputs, the existing integrations are not changing.
Jessica10:25
Okay.
Rakesh10:28
So the monolithic inside the erp, there are some changes, but not to the
particular example you're giving. Right. So yeah, so that's why there won't
be necessarily a data and intelligence script.
Jessica10:46
Understood. But they still need to do a validation to make sure that there
wasn't something impacted based on the original 14 or we. They're not at
all. It's just more of an acknowledgement that they are a down scene
receiver of information processes.
Rakesh11:11
It's more of the latter. So business will run these end to end processes.
Many of them are the same, some of them are changing, they're going to run
them through new information in the erp. So primarily the ERP information
data within the ERP is changing and obviously some of the other within the
14. So the challenge would be when they run an end to end scenario, they're
going to take so many systems that will touch that end to end scenario. So
if we want to store scenarios and use cases or test cases, we should say,
you know, maybe end to end process. Test cases like order to cache, record
to report, procure to pay would be probably ways we can store the files
for. I've got these 20 test cases. They all cater to. Four of them cater to
this process, five of them cater to this end to end process and then
internally they will touch these systems. Now there's also perhaps
functional test scripts to your point in these systems. So what we can do
is leave your folders as is the way it is. We will confirm with the ERP
team who are generating these scripts what sort of functional test scripts
they are. Are they for the ERP function, are they for another function and
are they for data and intelligence work stream? So we can ask those sort of
questions as to is it just the, you know, for ERP Finance and hr, is it
more so then we can say, okay, we can put those scripts into those
respective folders.
Jessica13:03
I'm following. So it sounds like what you're thinking is for the BRV ones
focus more on the process. So if we have two separate sets of folders,
folder one being the BRB ones, then have 14 different folders in there for
each one of these end to end systems.
Rakesh13:24
Rather than have. No, not, not have 14 folders.
Jessica13:27
Okay.
Rakesh13:28
So I would say, you know, really have under brv have processes so you know,
order to cash process or, or recorder report end to end processes. And so
the teams are generating end to end scenarios and the scripts are end to
end scripts as well as some functional scripts. So I would just categorize
them as we can find out what specifically those five or six end to end
processes are and put them and create them as well as whatever those
functional process tests are and put them, you know, create a folder for
those. I don't think they will generally. Now again, I think we could. My
understanding is it won't necessarily be across systems. Systems are used,
but they won't necessarily. Now we could certainly leave ERP Finance and HR
and then remove the rest.
Vicki14:32
Don't we want to show a holistic approach though? I know I came in late, my
system was teams was acting a fool, but anyway, I'm back on now. But don't
we want to show a holistic approach?
Rakesh14:47
What do you mean? Like. Okay, sorry.
Vicki14:51
Well just in terms of showing the big picture, right, because you got brv,
you got no brv. We have different tests scripts for each one. Are you
suggesting that, that we just separate and not include those work streams
that we're not going to be using that are. That are not applicable or. I'm
not following separation.
Rakesh15:09
I guess we're talking, we're talking brv. BRV is okay.
Vicki15:13
Okay.
Jessica15:14
All right.
Rakesh15:14
So for brv, we're testing end to end business processes, right?
Vicki15:18
Correct.
Rakesh15:19
So we're not, we're not. Every work stream is not impacted. Impacted by
that.
Jessica15:24
Right.
Rakesh15:25
And so for brv, my suggestion is to do it by process, by process and keep
the three functions of work streams we have mentioned here of ERP Finance
And HR for it. We ideally should not need others because they're not
impacted by BRV.
Jessica15:44
Okay, meaning.
Rakesh15:46
Meaning there's no scripts generated, etc. For BRV.
Jessica15:51
And Vicki, just to give you a little bit of context, we were trying to
figure out the intention is to have everybody have access to this folder,
whether they're BRB or non vrv. It was just how do we organize this so that
it makes the most sense for.
Vicki16:04
Right, that's what I was trying. That's what I was trying to. I was trying
to ask. Thanks, Jessica, because if, if I am. If I. If.
Jessica16:10
If you put a folder in here.
Vicki16:11
That'S not applicable to me. Right. But it's in the team site. I would want
a separate folder that only. I'm gonna go to. I don't want to mix apples
and oranges. So those. If I don't have any of these need to be in that
folder, then I'd rather, I'd rather only have a folder that I would need to
be in. You know what I mean? To have them separated if you're gonna put
them in the same channel. Does that make sense?
Jessica16:41
So I'm not sure it follows. I just want to repeat that. So you're thinking,
for example, like just right now looking at the non BRB ones like ISC and
Legal, right, we shouldn't have them in the same channel.
Vicki16:54
No, I'm saying we should just have them in separate folders.
Jessica16:57
Oh, they. No, I think yes, agreed. And that's why I want to just put this
out so we can start taking a look at how we think we need to organize.
Rakesh17:08
So. So Jessica, I think everything you have there would fit nicely into a
brv, non BRV folder.
Jessica17:16
I'm following. And then in a BRV folder we're going to do the end to end
systems.
Rakesh17:20
End to end processes and then processes.
Jessica17:23
Sorry.
Rakesh17:23
And then additionally include work streams or functions. These three listed
erp, Finance, hr.
Jessica17:35
So let me, let me ask one quick question and I think this is where the
disconnect of my head is. We have these 14 systems identified with three
business functions of ERP, Finance and HR. But what I think the piece that
I'm not. I didn't follow is there's also end to end production processes
that are technically not shown in this presentation. Or maybe I'm missing
the slide that we need to identify in the BRD folder.
Rakesh18:08
These, the end to end processes are being identified by functions. So say
supply chain, supply chain has end to end processes. They take those
processes and sub processes and Map them to. I need to run order management
as a, as a sub process for me to do order management, I'm going to touch
seven systems. One of them is ERP system, one of them is a commercial
system, one of them is a data analytics system, etc. So when I run the
process and the scenario for order management, I'm going to run that
scenario and the test case will. For that order management end to end. I'm
not going to necessarily have a test case to say ERP or this or that. I'm
going to run that scenario that says, or the test script that says go to
this system, do this, place an order, go to this system, execute the order,
go to this system, get the output report. So for brv, I think it's easier
for us to track it by process. And then for these, specifically for these
other areas, for these three IT work streams listed and they're actually,
maybe we should not call them business function because they're actually IT
work streams, IT Finance, IT HR and IT erp, we should create three folders
and you know, the rest are not necessarily, they're consumed by us or down,
you know, participant in this.
Jessica19:45
So I can summarize, I think I'm following Alice. We have these 14 systems
and we have some number. Do you happen to know off the top of your head how
many end to end processes we have?
Rakesh20:02
We have five, five or ten. Not the number of scenarios within those, but
yes, end to end process. Yes, five.
Jessica20:10
Okay, so these five end to end.
Rakesh20:14
Processes.
Jessica20:17
May have a piece of that process. I'm following what you mean by the end
of. But a piece of that process may have one or two or three or four
systems within it.
Rakesh20:28
Correct. Across different functions, across different work streams.
Jessica20:34
So is there also a end to end process list that's non BRB or that is only
specific to brb.
Rakesh20:47
End to end will be brb.
Vicki20:50
Okay, now BRB though it's only brb.
Rakesh20:55
Yes.
Vicki20:56
Okay.
Jessica21:07
I'll rename some of these folders.
Rakesh21:08
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Jessica21:09
Jeff in there we'll put on each one. But. Okay, so I can clean that up and
put everything else into non brv.
Rakesh21:17
The rest of these are good and suited for non brv.
Jessica21:22
Okay.
Vicki21:22
Okay.
Jessica21:23
And I'll probably need to alter the duplicate, not necessarily erp, where
to go.
Rakesh21:30
You would still put erp.
Jessica21:32
I would. Okay, but now we need the HR and finance.
Rakesh21:38
Right. So.
Vicki21:40
I think that's where I'm getting confused is the separation of the hr,
finance, erp. Are we going to duplicate all of it again, under each one of
those.
Rakesh21:52
They'Re two different events.
Vicki21:55
Correct. I get that.
Rakesh21:57
So they should be. Yeah, they have not. We should absolutely. If there's
systems involved for day one and inside these work streams, we should
include them.
Jessica22:07
Okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna summarize or make an analogy again or example
that I think may help just make sure we're all on the same page. So I don't
know what the exact numbers are, but let's say there are 20 systems for HR,
three of them are BRB critical and 17 are not. What we would do here is the
three that are BRB critical go in the BRB folder and the 17 that are not
would go in the non BRB folder. Great.
Rakesh22:39
Yes. Yeah. And they're not mutually exclusive, so let's add a wrinkle to
that. But yes, the logic is valid.
Vicki22:47
But see, I guess I'm thinking about the wrinkle or I must be thinking about
the wrinkle because what I, I understand the logic that you just said,
Jessica, in terms of what we're doing, but know how to explain one son. So
keep going.
Jessica23:07
I'll come up with that.
Rakesh23:08
So let's keep going. Let's. Let me try and clarify the, the scope of these
two things. BRV is soft spin for August 1st.
Jessica23:19
Yeah.
Rakesh23:19
There is end to end processes, there's legal entities changing within
Honeywell for Athens, Athens is getting a new legal entity, etc. Those are
all changes happening in the ERP system, in finance systems, in HR systems.
So physically there are some changes happening there because of these
changes. Functions need to run end to end processes to test out that
everything works, that manufacturing works, supply chain works. So if you
want to take just work streams, you can take ERP Finance, HR and whatever
else we find out as the core and have those folders there functions will
come in and run end to end processes that touch, I don't know, seven work
streams, those process, they will then get the results, etc. In addition,
these three work streams will have systems impacted directly where changes
are being made. So you're going to for brv, your trust tracking those end
to end processes and also any functional testing in these three scope
areas. Erp, Finance, HR now.
Vicki24:33
Okay, so stop right there. Stop right there. Based on what you just said,
why would we not do the folders by the finance, the hr, ERP and then have
sub folders under those as we need them? Why would we not make those
headings?
Rakesh24:49
Because end to end processes touch everything. They're end to end business
processes. They don't deal with, just they're not system centric.
Vicki24:57
So Vicki, I think, but there's two separate testing though. There's going
to be end to end and then there's going to be the functional processing of
each one of the areas. So finance is going to do theirs, HR is going to
have to do theirs. Each one are going to have to do their individual ones
as well as we're going to have to do full system from end to end. Right.
Rakesh25:14
Full process end to end across multiple. So that's what we're suggesting is
for brv, you have. So if you click on the BRV folder again, Jessica. So
you're going to have for these three systems, erp, these three work
streams, erp finance, you will put the functional tests and everything and
the system related info inside.
Vicki25:36
Yes.
Rakesh25:36
And then end to end processes like procure to pay, hire to retire, etc.
Will have subfolders inside the end to end process.
Vicki25:44
Okay, I agree. I'm with you. I'm with you there. Okay, I'm with you there.
Rakesh25:48
All right, now for day one, which is October 27th, we've got all these
applications and systems that are migrating, nothing to do with end to end
process. They're applications that are getting cloned, applications that
are moving as is building. So what you had is a folder structure across
those. And in fact the second slide that you looked at all those, you could
put system by system and say what is this story here? So you could have
seven or eight folders that had, you know, the same folder structure and
whatever we want to put in there, we could have it there. So business apps,
CCEX, DEX, ERP, HR, finance, HRIS, we should say finance, etc. So all of
these will all be for non BRV. So October 27th, migration of systems.
Jessica27:00
I think I'm good.
Vicki27:01
Yeah.
Jessica27:03
Once it kind of settled in, I do. At first I wasn't sure I like this idea,
but I'm following your concern, Rakesh, which is that if we put an end to
end in one of the business functions, which it doesn't really reside there
because multiple functions will touch it, something may get lost.
Vicki27:22
Except exactly. That's where I was. Jessica.
Jessica27:25
I'm on board. I'm on board. All right, so here's the next thing. So I think
we're aligned on VRV versus non vrv. The next thing is here are the four
folders that I think belong in each of these folders. But I want to talk
through this and then I can copy and Paste them in. First one is UAT test
script. I think that's a given. We need that for every single sub function,
secondary function and then process are going to want to have a schedule
and a reporting folder. But Rakesh, I want to talk through this with you a
bit. Little bit. Because assumption is that each of these teams are going
to have their own schedule. Yes, they'll. They'll roll up into your high
level schedule. But I would expect that each one should have their own
schedule and expect for them to be doing some level of daily updating which
is why I wanted to have either a scheduled folder and. Or if they're going
to put their actual whatever they're tracked in, pretend it's out Excel
file. And that's fine to mostly be a folder, but I would expect there to be
a schedule in there. Does that make sense?
Rakesh28:45
It does. So I think a schedule. So conceptually agree with you, I think
where we will need to get tighter is BRB is an sit UAT that's happening
over two weeks actually going back to that slide. Three weeks, two plus
one, maybe four weeks. Give me one second. Sorry, just someone at the door
but. And then the rest of it, the day one stuff is actually migration
that's happening between July and October. So the schedule will be much
broader and different teams will maintain it. But I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Jessica29:24
Yeah, no worries.
Rakesh30:25
Apologies about that.
Jessica30:28
No worries, no problem.
Rakesh30:30
Yeah, sorry. So I think it makes absolute sense to have that schedule
because it'll be a much tighter schedule that the ERP team gives us about
calendaring these four weeks. So once they publish that, it should be in
there at and that will truly come out of that ERP team that provides that
testing schedule literally day by day. Okay, now for the non brv. Just one
thing to add there, the non BRV is all these different work streams will
migrate at a different time or test at a different time all the way from
now till end of September. So they'll all have their own schedules which
will be in the regular tracker, the readiness tracker that we have. So they
can each provide a schedule. In fact they maintain it in their work plans,
etc. Although. So it may be a little bit.
Vicki31:33
More.
Rakesh31:36
I don't know the right word. We just have to. Yeah, well, redundant. I
mean, yeah, it will be in multiple places, but I think it makes sense to
have it. It's just, you know, there has to be some consolidated schedule in
there as well. So we could put it in there and see how we can maximize the
Use of it.
Jessica31:57
Okay. I'm not as concerned about at least as long as they put a schedule in
there. I'm not so much concerned about keeping that up to date as I am some
of the other things. So I do think we need a reporting folder and I also
had a question related to that of, do we have a reporting template of what
our expectations are as a report out from the businesses?
Rakesh32:30
Tell you more. I think I follow you, but you mean in terms of testing? In
terms of.
Jessica32:39
Yeah. And some of this might be in the UAT test scripts. I just put
reporting here so we can have this conversation. But I would expect there
to be some output on a daily basis from them saying, we did this many tests
today, this many pass, this many fail, we are this much percent complete
and expenses from each of the work streams and, or each of the end to end
process owners and. Yeah.
Rakesh33:09
Yes. So the tool that they're using. Toss.
Vicki33:12
Yeah. I have a question is what are they using today? How do we even know
whether they're entrepreneur?
Rakesh33:18
No. So I, I believe the latest conversation Vicki, with Sukai this
afternoon. Afternoon was that TOSCA is still a go and that it will actually
accelerate our readiness. It's not going to be a negative. There's no
logins required, no training required because the automation team is going
to execute everything in Tosca and then the function functional teams are
actually just going to go in and if there's any defects or any, you know,
failed tests, they will validate the implementation inputs and outputs and
then they will provide the corrections. And then the Tosca, the AI team,
the test team will run those scripts and automate them again. So it looks
like TOSCA is still a go and TOSCA will be able to provide that full
details and the reporting out of it. As I ran three scenarios today, I ran
20 test scripts. 19 of them passed, one of them failed. Here was a SEP3
defect, etc.
Vicki34:17
Okay, and who's in charge of that task, you say? The automation.
Rakesh34:22
The AI team with Monica and Asha.
Vicki34:25
Okay, gotcha.
Jessica34:29
So is Tosca, basically I've never used it before, so I don't know what it
is. Is it just gonna, are we gonna input like all of our UAT test scripts
and then it'll, as people do their testing, put their notes in, they'll
just give us a report out of what's going on with their UAT testing.
Rakesh34:45
Correct. That's what I understand.
Jessica34:46
For SIT and uat. Okay.
Rakesh34:50
Okay.
Vicki34:51
It's a gen AI tool that was created that we did when I was on the gen AI
side for task or for testing.
Rakesh34:57
Sorry, Avinash, go ahead.
Avinash35:00
That's not uat. If you're using a tool to do testing or that's basically
what you're doing is you're doing an integration test out there to
validate, hey, is my end to end process working out there? Which is good.
But then UAT is all about business carrying in the system and validating it
through and through as if you're going to use. Then there's absolutely no
need for business to do any UAT out there. You could just produce your SID
and say, hey, here is all the best results that you've done using a tool.
Validate this. And if everything is green, what is business going to even
do out there? They are not going to execute the script, they're not going
to execute the scripts. See, the automation team is going to run the
scripts on behalf of any user. This is not going to be licensed to end
users. Say, ok, this is your instance of go run it. No, that's not the way
it works. The AFT testing team will have the ownership to run the scripts
with the inputs and output. As in with the inputs and whatever the output
that it's going to generate is going to be handed over. So business is not
getting into the system of that. If, because I heard this on the call, I
was not even sure what they were saying. Why is it being called as uat? UAT
is business getting into the system and doing the testing. Testing, sorry.
Jessica36:21
So I'm gonna ask if I can, if I can summarize what you're saying. It sounds
like we're going to TOSCA for sit, but when we leverage, when we do UAT
because we want the users in there, we are not going to be using tosca.
Avinash36:36
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Rakesh36:37
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Vicki36:39
Okay.
Avinash36:41
What I call is the expectation is that the business is also going to use
task to validate it.
Jessica36:50
Okay.
Avinash36:51
That's what I.
Jessica36:57
Doing the SIT in Tosca. And then when we do uat, the end users are going to
be doing uat, but they will also still be leveraging tosca.
Rakesh37:09
I don't know, Jessica, I'm not the decision maker on it as far as the tool
use and how that execution is. I believe that's aligned with now Sukai and
that AI Monica and you know, Bill, the ERP team. So we may need to
understand whether again, for the purposes of our purposes, we will be. For
your reporting. You should be able to get. We should be able to get reports
out of TOSCA that we could out of jira.
Jessica37:44
Okay, so all I want to do then is whether we do it by folder or just in
brb, I think we need to take a daily snapshot of what those reports look
like so we have the version history on that. I don't know if TOSCA does
that or not, but I think it would be good for the business to have those.
So I don't know if it makes sense to have them by each function slash, end
to end, process owner or just if it's all in one report, just have somebody
on like the IT side just grab a snapshot at the end of each day.
Avinash38:16
We can be able to provide.
Rakesh38:18
Yeah, okay. We can see how the report comes out and then we can make the
folders accordingly.
Avinash38:24
We could check out an email and say, hey, is there anything clear from
other projects that you got this Such reports that you can share with us?
Validation just before. So you should be able to share that information.
Jessica38:39
Okay. As you're doing that report, just again trying to think as
streamlined and simply as we can. When you put the test scenarios into
Tosca, do you actually have due dates on there? Meaning do I need to have a
schedule folder or if we're just pulling a report from tsca, is that really
going to give us the what was scheduled for that day, what was tested that
day? Because I wanted to have the schedule in here so we had an
understanding of what they were doing. But if that's going to be identified
in Taska, then I don't know that we need like a schedule or reporting
folder.
Rakesh39:24
Let's keep it. If we don't see value in it or if it's a pure duplication,
we can remove it. But the schedule and the sequencing of, you know, this
team comes this date and does this nine times nine to 12. You know, nine to
12. And this team comes in and does this scenario two to five. That
sequencing will be provided by the ERP team over next week. So we should
certainly include it in here because that's what everybody will be tracking
to. And then the execution that's happening in TOSCA will follow along
those. So there is a value for it. We'll see if it ends up being redundant
to the capability within TOSCA to give us those outputs.
Jessica40:08
Okay, can I get access to task?
Rakesh40:15
Why not? But I would.
Vicki40:18
Jessica, you probably can get access to tsca but. And we can do it on our
side do Honeywell. But the automation team is the one that's kind of
holding a lot of That I don't know who the lead is but there's no reason
why you shouldn't have why you couldn't get us couldn't get access to see
it.
Jessica40:36
Okay.
Rakesh40:36
I think maybe talk to Asha or Monica.
Jessica40:39
Yeah.
Avinash40:41
I don't know what the licensing model is on that Google how that's going to
work. So it's worthwhile because I guess.
Jessica40:52
I'm trying to understand a little better is the sit. I'm not concerned
because it sounds like the team that's going to be doing SIT is already
connected with toscan. Fantastic. UAT if I heard, if I understood it
correctly was we weren't going to get all the end users users into tosca.
But then I'm wondering how we would track that.
Avinash41:18
Yeah, me either because again very similar to you. I'm still on the fringe
of the SET campaign but what I heard and this acronym was called briefly
when I was on in the first half I think Bill was explaining it or Bill was
explaining it that they are going to have use or leverage JavaScript for
doing the testing and then get the business teams to validate that. When
you say that if the business is not getting into the system and just doing
a validation of a script that was executed by an AI system or an automation
tool or whatever we want to call that, then it's not uap. UAP from my
perspective having managed large programs, I know unless the business gets
into the system goes and does the testing of that they don't generally
consider.
Rakesh42:10
That as even if the system is not changing.
Vicki42:15
But that's exactly so here's what I agree exactly what you were saying in
terms of the process that UAT that as far as UAT automation is going to be
run with tsca the output comes out, we give it to the business and we say
compare this to the scenario. Is it right or is it wrong? And you're right,
that means that it's just. We're just testing the out the outcome. But the
understanding was is if the systems in the middle were not changing, it
didn't. It was no harm, no foul. If we let automation run the scripts, get
the outcome and let the business do it. If the systems are changing then
that's a different scenario that the system, you know, we're doing a
script, the systems are changing and just to get the outcome for the
business to validate that's a different story. But so I think you have a
valid point but we need to understand back to which system what what's
changing and what's not Changing because Taska can really speed us up for
those systems that aren't changing to run it and get our scripts and all
that and let the business validate. But when it comes to those systems
changing it is another scenario.
Avinash43:26
But if it's. So let's assume for a moment that the process by and large
remains the same. Yes, there is some minor variation here and there. Then
why are we calling out a dependency on any July 4th holiday or whether the
users are going to be available? If the expectation is that Oscar is going
to run scripts and business just needs to validate, we just can use a
couple of days out there and say, hey, this is going to all get executed.
We will have the outputs here, come back out here and take over, validate
this and sign off. Because I don't know how long it's going to take because
they could use the SIT results itself. Why do we need to have a separate
UAD timeline there? If.
Rakesh44:15
Yeah, I mean all possibilities, I think, you know. Yeah, yeah, we'll.
Again, I think Bill explained it. The AI team is doing it. So I think if
there are efficiencies to be gained like as you're saying, run the scripts
over the weekend because it's automated, come back on the seventh. I think
that. Well, the point is people are on vacation. So whether you come in
remotely and test it or validate it or in their. I think the point is July
4th, the US teams are out for extended time. So you can absolutely run the
script and leave it there, run the scenarios, leave it there, come back
whenever you come back and validate it. But again, we're not trying to
solve it now. So what do you need, Jessica? What more do you need in terms
of moving the needle forward for your folder structure? We will add a
couple of readiness tracker reports in here for you. One for BRV and one
for non brv. They actually ask the same thing. They ask the details around
and let me share this with you so you can kind of get a view if you don't
mind me sharing my screen.
Jessica45:28
You can do that. Okay, one, one quick thing, I think the other thing. So I
will copy these folders in. We can get everybody added to this. I think two
big things that we do need to probably get addressed within the next day or
two. One, I think we need a better understanding of when we're leveraging
task of when we're not and if we're not what we're what the plan is because
the defect intake planner. I didn't spend a lot of time on this, obviously,
but we may not need that if we're going to use task. So I just want to make
sure that we're aligned with that and we're not communicating something out
that we don't need to. But the second thing, which I think is a little bit
more important is I have questions around mos. One around meeting cadences
and two, around what communication reporting we need. Again, understanding
TOSCA better will help because if we can pull a report from TASCA and has
everybody in there, great. But and I think Vicki touched upon this in some
of our earlier calls. We need to probably set up a daily call with these
teams to say, hey, our expectations get through this. Or if we need
something from them, like if our plan is to have them update their schedule
on a daily basis, we need that MOS identified and ready to run probably in
the Next, let's say 24 hours to start really getting these teams on board.
Vicki46:51
Right. Because what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to do
the daily scrums with them. Like this is our 15 minute scrum. Okay. This is
what you were supposed to work on yesterday. Did you finish it? Did you
have any problems? And this is what we're going to work on today. Talk to
you tomorrow. This is what you worked on today. I mean, I think we're going
to end up having to do that.
Rakesh47:14
So it may be for these. We probably have to. Okay, no, I follow you. We may
have to talk to the functional process leads and the bill and the TOSCA
team for that. Because once you are able to calendar and have the sequence,
then we will be able to talk to the right testers and or the right leads,
the UAT function lead as well as the IT lead on and the functional UAT
coordinator on that particular status.
Jessica47:56
And just out of curiosity, is there calls with that team with those folks?
Rakesh48:00
Right now we have set up again, that's part of the MOS we need to set up.
So I think if you look at that there was a suggested mos, I think in one of
the other slides, the latest slides. We have to see if that is robust
enough or if we need a, you know, modify. Let's enrich it to make it fit
for what we need to do. That was just.
Jessica48:22
So what do we need to do to get.
Vicki48:23
What do we need to do to get an agreement on that? I realize it's something
that. Wait, that has to happen. But how can we take action so that we can
get a result? Because so that we're not waiting in this and and letting
time go by. What do we need to do to be able to get that ball moving? Is
that. Are you just waiting on us to say yes, that's what we're going to.
Rakesh48:42
Do and make it happen or you mean the mos?
Jessica48:48
Yeah.
Vicki48:48
The fact that you know we needed to make sure whether the MOS was good or
not if we needed it more robust.
Rakesh48:54
Well one let's review it either live edited here and or just review and
provide feedback. We can set up the MOS because that again that was
something we put together for peers because he was going to connect with
the rest of his other UAT coordinator. So. But what there's nothing
stopping us from doing that. I think we can go ahead and start that doesn't
have the daily scrums on it so we'll have to add enrich that with adding
the other daily scrums. That one is more for Pierce and his UAT colleagues
coordinator functional coordinators to sync up. So that was a weekly sync
with follow ups. So I think if you want to get double click into that one
level and get very tactical then we need to set up additional daily scrums
with the right people. So either and if it's UAT then it's back to that
same UAT functional coordinators who will have that view because they're
supposed to be the supply chain functional coordinator or the finance
functional coordinator or the end to end process lead will have that view
of these are the things to be done today, these are the things that we
executed, etc.
Jessica50:18
I think you were gonna. Sorry to interrupt you Vicki. I think you're gonna
show us something. But I think back to Vicki's point where I was getting
that too is then let's get into that by tactically make those updates and
then review it at tomorrow 7am Call because I think where Vicki's trying to
allude to is we need to get a sign off on this tomorrow. So if we need to
bring it to Jeff, to Kai, to whoever, we need to do this tomorrow because
we can't wait now that we are in the middle of what is supposed to be sit
yet.
Vicki50:49
Time is not on our side. We need to do whatever we got to do. And if you
take something to Sakai, I know for real, if you take something very
tactical to her she's going to say why aren't you just doing your job? And
it's not more of this is the MOS that we're asking permission to. It's more
of this is the mos.
Rakesh51:06
That we're going to use. And we want you to know what.
Vicki51:08
The expectations of the outcomes are. We're not asking permission to go and
do it. We're doing more of facilitating. This is what we're going to do. Of
awareness. If she wants something to change or Jeff wants something to
change, they'll tell us that. But we just don't have time to sit and wait.
We got to get this ball rolling.
Rakesh51:23
Understood. So you mentioned additional scrums, so can you take a look at
that suggested MOS and provide feedback?
Vicki51:34
Sure. We can do this, Jessica. We just pull it up. Let's do it.
Jessica51:39
Yeah, they. Whatever. Cash. Do you guys want to pull it up or do you want
me to pull it up?
Rakesh51:43
It's in that same deck. It's in that same deck. I think you. You were
sharing.
Jessica51:48
I can. I can re. Share.
Rakesh51:49
Yeah.
Jessica51:55
All right. So you guys can see my screen.
Rakesh51:58
Yes.
Vicki51:59
Yes.
Jessica51:59
Okay. So OPSEP call. I know what the existing OPSEP call is. The UAT SAT
Reporting to Function, Program Leadership Essay Critical Issues Document
Cross functional Follow ups. I think this is fine for opsep, but what we
should at least keep in the back in our back pocket is if we have an
escalation that happens, let's say the Thursday after Wednesday's opsep, we
shouldn't be waiting. So we need to also make sure that each function is
escalating to Pierce and yourself, whoever, and that we have some kind of.
Even if it's unofficial escalation, you know, someone's. Again, someone's
going to Pierce on Thursday with something that really needed to be known
yesterday on opsep. We should be escalating to Sukai Jeff that day. So
that's something I think we need to talk through with. With Pierce, but I
think for the opset one, that's fine. UAT coordinator weekly sync. I think
this is where we are not aligned because I think this needs to be daily.
Rakesh53:04
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. So we had it as follow ups, but I think we
can make the black bars all. You know, that's if I think we're. What I'm
hearing is, you know, we make that like the daily scrum.
Vicki53:18
Yes.
Rakesh53:19
And the daily sync. So it's not a weekly sync, it's a daily sync.
Jessica53:22
Yeah. Give me one second. I just realized I'm the one I have open is a read
only. So I'm just going to. Because I think I opened the attachment that
you sent versus the link because I didn't originally have access to the
Link. So give me one second. I just don't want to update it here. And then
we're happy. Do it again.
Vicki53:51
And we, we just need to set expectations that end that daily call. What we
want to know is what was completed off of the schedule, any challenges you
ran into and what you're going to do today, period, next day, then the next
day. We do it each day, so it's just a ramp. Robin, I finished this. This
is now done. We're good. We're gonna do this today to finish it. And I have
no challenges or I did this yesterday. This was a challenge that I had. And
this is what I'm going to try to work on today to complete. I don't know
that we have to make it complicated is my point.
Jessica54:23
Yeah. And Vicki, out of curiosity, I'm on the fence of do we have one call
and invite everybody to team call or have separate calls for each. Each of
the functions or like an.
Vicki54:34
End to end process on a separate. I want a separate call for each function.
You try to get too many people on the phone, we waste too much time. We
ain't got time. I wanted to be targeted to them and I want them. No,
seriously, I want to be targeted to them. They all need to be listening
because we're talking to you. If we talk to one SBG and not talking to the
other, they're not paying attention. I want it to be something that we're
talking to them, specifically to them. We get our answers and we move on.
Everybody knows it is their accountability.
Jessica54:59
Yep, Understood. Okay. Part of the reason to ask is because if we did one
call, it was going to be an hour, maybe longer. If we're doing separate
calls, depending on the function, it's probably going to be 15 to 30
minutes.
Vicki55:12
Exactly. Exactly.
Jessica55:14
Yeah.
Rakesh55:15
So for BRB, you're going to talk to process leaders. So not necessarily by
function. Again, if you're running seven end to end processes, you're going
to talk to a process leader that has executed across four work streams or
across 10 systems, but really that business process and I.
Jessica55:37
Think when we start, that makes sense. But if we are starting to see that
one of these is slipping or we're not getting the information we need, then
we deep dive that one and say, hey, because you're not getting what we
need. If that process lead has, let's say five different testers, whatever,
and we're not getting what we need, then we escalate that and say, hey,
this is now becoming everybody join us poll because we're not getting what
we need and we need to figure out what that breakdown is.
Rakesh56:04
I'm with you.
Jessica56:05
Okay, so I want to make sure we're using the right term that's UAT
Coordinator daily. Well we call it closing.
Rakesh56:15
Now.
Jessica56:17
Is the term UAT Coordinator General enough or do we need to make maybe
change this to say process, function, leave, daily sync or is the UAT
coordinator the same person?
Rakesh56:32
UAT so, so UAT coordinator Pierce is IT coordinator. He's also CCEX
coordinator. Sriram is supply chain coordinator. Will Johnson, his team are
finance coordinator. Within that they have process leads. Within supply
chain. Within that they have, you know, they also have end to end process
leads. So you're gonna have to both to this. So the coordinators as well as
the process leads.
Jessica57:13
Okay. Functional line of calls. Gather status from function teams. Update
tracker and dashboard. Prepare for Wednesday reporting. I think this one's
fine to leave because it's really more prepping for offset right now.
Rakesh57:33
This is function. So we have it. So we may. If this is redundant and if you
have your red bar as a daily bar, then this functional alignment calls is
perhaps if the supply chain functions wants to talk it out with each, you
know, amongst themselves. Those are functional calls that it may or may not
be in. But if they have something that flows into the daily sync then
they'll, you know, they may meet at 8 and meet for the daily sync sync at
night.
Jessica58:05
Understood. And I, so I think what the way you have saying as needed by
function makes sense. If they don't feel they need it because they're
getting enough of a connection point through the daily sync, great. If not
they can set up the call Tuesday.
Rakesh58:20
Yeah, or any, any other day we put Tuesdays but really every, you know,
daily as needed by function.
Jessica58:28
Right. Yeah, but Tuesday makes sense because it's, it's playing into this.
So I think leave it again to your point. They can modify as needed. UAT
Coordinator follow up.
Rakesh58:42
These were. These have been replaced now by the daily sync. So because it
was a weekly sync, these were follow ups. But yeah. So these can.
Everything discussed here is in the red or should be in the red.
Jessica58:55
Okay. So we can delete this row.
Vicki58:58
Yes.
Rakesh58:59
And make sure the participants are on. No, no, no.
Jessica59:01
Yeah.
Vicki59:02
Make sure you add what's in that row to what's above. Don't just delete it.
He's saying be covered in that one.
Jessica59:08
Yeah, I'm following.
Vicki59:10
Yeah. So if there's duplicates that we can delete. But let's just make sure
we have everything first.
Jessica59:14
Functional UAT coordinator. UAT coordinator. So I think this one.
Rakesh59:20
That's fine. That's covered it UAT lead and it UAT coordinator is fine.
Additional smps is needed.
Jessica59:29
Yeah, I think that's the only one that's not up here.
Rakesh59:32
Yeah.
Vicki59:32
Okay.
Rakesh59:33
And that could be function, you know, testers or they could be the double
clicks, like.
Jessica59:38
Exactly. Okay. All right. So do we feel comfortable now that.
Rakesh59:44
I complete this route and then make sure.
Vicki59:47
Wait a minute.
Rakesh59:48
The objective go to the other side.
Vicki59:50
Yes, that's what I was looking at too.
Rakesh59:55
No, no, no.
Jessica59:56
Sorry. Which one?
Rakesh59:57
Same left hand side.
Vicki59:58
Just same slide.
Jessica59:59
Just the left side.
Rakesh1:00:05
Progress update trackers and dashboards. I think something we do. Yeah,
maybe the bullet, fourth bullet. And then we should just call it escalation
from. From previous meeting. Not necessarily from a week week.
Vicki1:00:28
Yeah, previous meeting. Exactly.
Rakesh1:00:32
I think the rest of it is. Yeah, then those look good. Okay.
Vicki1:00:40
So we can take that.
Rakesh1:00:56
So that was. If we're meeting on Friday, then under this construct of a
weekly, then Friday would have been used for status consolidation. But if
we're meeting week daily, that's probably not a, you know, requirement.
Vicki1:01:14
You think we still have to bring it whether we do it in in this meeting
format. But I do think we're going to have to bring things together at the
end of every week to be able to report as an executive level.
Rakesh1:01:26
Yeah. So then. Yeah, so it's not the daily scrum. This will be another
meeting where we consolidate all the reports.
Vicki1:01:33
Right?
Jessica1:01:35
Yeah. I think it's worth keeping this on if you realize that.
Vicki1:01:38
I agree.
Jessica1:01:38
Everything is captured in this. Fantastic. I like this as a separate call
out. I think it's a good one that sometimes people for about. I think
that's where some of the concerns at least that I got looped into were
coming from. So I would say we leave it for now and then delete as
necessary.
Rakesh1:01:55
Okay. So that's a daily sync. A function alignment call is needed. A Friday
status consolidation and then the Tuesday daily sync will feed into. Oh,
the all IT connect. On Mondays there is a weekly all IT connect that
happens where work streams provide their status and all the IT work streams
come in. So certainly for sit, you know, they'll be providing some updates
there. So the question is whether anything can be cleaned. Something will
be cleaned from that. Information from there can flow into the Tuesday. So
information from the Monday scrum can flow into that IT connect in the
afternoon and any outputs from that IT connect can flow into the Tuesday
daily meeting.
Jessica1:02:48
Yes. So can you guys update this? I think It's a good graphic. Update this
graphic when we get offline.
Rakesh1:02:59
Okay. So yeah, five red bars and then remove the black bars. And I think
the function is just. Okay.
Jessica1:03:07
And then the only. So I think this is good. I think the only other thing
that we should either add to this or have a separate slide for it is
whatever the expectation of reporting from the businesses is we should
note, we noted on here. So for example, if everything can come out of Tosca
and the expectations that somebody from it is going to just email that out
every day at 5pm we need to note that somewhere.
Rakesh1:03:40
Yeah, I see a point. Yeah. And, or if, and, or if somebody from leadership
outside of Wednesday wants, you know, Jeff or Steerco or something wants
reporting.
Jessica1:03:50
Yeah, because for example, if we're going to pull the reporting at 5pm but
somebody's busy and they're always going to be doing their UAT testing 6pm
to 9pm because it's, you know, second job for them, theirs is going to show
late even though it may technically not be late. So I want to make sure we
identify what that reporting mos looks like. So if it's expectations the
business sends it to us or if it's just the timing of hey, every day at 9pm
or the next morning at 6am is when the report goes out for the day before
we have that document somewhere.
Rakesh1:04:30
Understood. Maybe then we have a functional. So if functions want something
and they want to report out, they bring it to the scrum the next morning.
So we could set up additional boxes for each function to provide the sort
of a sync and then report into the scrum whatever reports they bring in,
etc. Whatever requirements reports.
Jessica1:05:04
But I agree with that mostly. But I think even if it's not to leadership, I
still think there needs to be something to I guess it would be peers or
yourself, whoever is, if you will, responsible for uat. I think there needs
to be some daily replacement reporting to that person and then communally
that's getting coordinated or called out on opsep, I don't think it should
be just within the business because theoretically if the business thinks
they're on track and someone like Pierce is supposed to be reviewing this
and says I don't think they are, he needs to be able to escalate it quick.
We are just so short with time that I'm, I think that's the reporting we
need at do this. Let's get it documented on here somehow and talk that
through tomorrow with Tsukai because her expectation at this point and
Vicki, you Know better than I do. Might be that she wants to see those
daily. I don't know. But we should review that with her.
Rakesh1:06:04
Okay.
Vicki1:06:05
Okay.
Rakesh1:06:05
Okay. So action item here. And if you want to just put a box here and write
an action item and I can fall. I can complete the action item here meaning
just, just put a blurb here that says, you know, add something. Right. What
we talked about. Add.
Jessica1:06:21
Yep.
Rakesh1:06:22
Add a blurb around. Reporting. Right. So. Or in your own words, whatever
you just.
Jessica1:06:32
Yeah, reporting what time. Who wants to see it? Is Tosco spelled T O S C A?
Rakesh1:06:51
Yeah.
Jessica1:06:52
Right. Will Tosca port show everything? It's kind of just an open question
I have right now.
Rakesh1:07:13
Okay.
Jessica1:07:16
All right. I think we've made good progress for today. One last quick
question and I know we're over, but thank you everyone for staying on for
the team site. Who should I give access to? And do you have a. A list
somewhere of all of the names with last names of all the people that need
to invited to this?
Rakesh1:07:48
Yes. So I think what we can do is. It's not an exhaustive list. What I do
have is a list of all of the IT players, IT work stream leads and it, you
know, and I think. And certainly project managers. What. From a business
from a functional perspective, we have the function leads and whoever else
the function sponsors, function leads and the UAT leads. Outside that, I
don't have a list of all the functional users or testers yet. Like who's a
primary. Who's secondary. Once those names come in over the next couple of
days, those can also be added on there. So it may be a bit iterative, but
we have an initial list to start with and then that list can grow to be
exhaustive depending on what the function leads, you know, say or whom they
wish to give access access to.
Jessica1:08:48
So would it be helpful or beneficial to create a, like a racy or a contact
list unless I already have one. Put everybody on it. Like I see the leads
on here and like this, I get that this makes sense. I'm just trying to
think through because to your point, Rakesh, like I don't know that you
really need more than as long as I ask for last names on here. So I knew
who everybody was. But if they're already folks ingrained in the process,
maybe it doesn't matter for everybody else. But big picture, like if we
want to dig in more and make sure, for example, like HR again was talking
to Sandra. Yeah. She said that there's going to be four or six different
people with an ADP testing this like we probably want to see all the people
back to Vicki's point taking time back into Suez vacation. Like I just. I
think it would be helpful to have a full comprehensive list of names
somewhere we can.
Rakesh1:09:55
So if we want tester. Yeah, so understood. We'll have to iterate on that
and may take us iteratively to get there. So for example, Sandra can give
us an Excel list of across these 26 countries. These are the local people
test testing it so they all get access to this folder, you know, across,
you know, some form or fashion they will support the HR payroll testing,
ADP payroll testing in these 26 countries. So we can give them that.
Similarly for the process supply chain may have, you know, these functional
leads as well as additional testers. So all of those along with the leads
can get. So we may have to create different folders. But yeah, sorry, not
different lists. But yes, it will be a sum of all of those that get into
access to the fold to this structure to the teams channel.
Jessica1:10:47
Yeah, I think it would be helpful if we can just create a file, just dump
it in the teams channel. We can use the functions to update it. Yeah, if
things are going well, we're not going to need it. My concern is if things
are not going well, I feel like we're going to want to deep dive that list.
Rakesh1:11:01
Yeah, we have a seed. We have a file that we can seed with the names we
know. And then Sandra, if we miss something from her 26 country list, she
can go in and add additional.
Jessica1:11:13
Yeah.
Rakesh1:11:17
And if she needs something she can, you know, add that and then request
request access to the owner of the channel.
Jessica1:11:26
Sounds good.
Rakesh1:11:28
Okay, so we'll take that back as a action item for us to do and get get by
in the morning. Okay so action item for me here or for us the. Sorry, I
didn't mean to interject that Vicki.
Jessica1:11:46
The.
Rakesh1:11:47
The MOS update the mosquito give you a list of the current participants we
have that we know will need access to this and then what else send you the
tracker. Actually we'll post the tracker in here. That's a tracker we're
asking teams to go fill out the details on.
Jessica1:12:12
Yep.
Rakesh1:12:14
Just so that you are aware. Let me share the tracker and I think API.
Jessica1:12:18
Nice.
Rakesh1:12:18
She certainly had to crop. But this is what Mac created for BRV and non
brv. So we have a similar one for non brv. So we've got as you can see, the
same list of the eight or nine work streams and actually maybe we should
call them work streams 80 plus systems in play. We've got, you know, their
disposition, their, you know, work stream lead, IT lead service owner who
may or may not need access to this. The Athens IT lead planned sit, start
and end dates. These come from their work plans. But we're taking and doing
an exercise to validate this with each of these work stream leads and then
test resource. They have two for primary, secondary. This is more of a
tracker here. Again, we wanted to do this as a readiness and execution
tracker so that we can run some bi on this. The expectation was that this
will reside in Capital Edge right now in smartsheets, but it could go into
an inventory in capital Edge where you can run some reports for readiness.
But the ask is okay, find the function lead, testing resources, test,
start, end. The ones in greens have been validated with the fun with the
work streams. But then, you know, align on schedule, test scripts,
environment, data access. So again, this is probably not needed because I
think the answer would be tosca and you know, etc. So this is the tracker
we're having them fill out. And so we want to start running some reporting
on this for readiness. Purely for readiness. Right. And then certainly into
an execution to say, you know, once the schedule is aligned, you know, how
many, what is the, what is the percentage complete, etc. If there are other
places we can do this easier and not make this redundant, then we can
certainly do that because there isn't one. Right now we're creating this
tracker and having teams fill it out so that we, we can start tracking.
Jessica1:14:28
Okay. So you know what, why don't you, when you get a chance, just put this
in the team site. Let me take a look. Because yes, I don't want to have
people doing things in two different places. So as long as we have all the
data somewhere, we can always manipulate it as we see fit. A need. We may
even be able to for example, leverage this for full contact list and just
have a separate person thing to make it easier for everybody.
Rakesh1:14:54
Sure, yeah. Because everybody here along with all these. Yeah, yeah. 90% of
the names should be here plus the leadership, you know, will not be here.
But yes. So we will send you these, the current versions of these. And then
the expectation is that for brv the teams fill that out in the next day or
two and for the non brb they fill in out by end of the week. So we'll
certainly have a full view of this to start running reporting on. I think
the goal is to be able to do this so we can at least show for Jeff the BRV
one completed, so we can run reports on that for Friday.
Jessica1:15:39
Okay.
Rakesh1:15:44
All right, so we'll post the current version in that folder. And if you
could give Mac and I access to that folder, you should.
Jessica1:15:51
Have it already, because I put in the four of us. And what I can do is.
Rakesh1:15:54
Could you just. Could you just drop a link just for reference?
Jessica1:15:59
Yes. I was literally about to do that.
Rakesh1:16:01
Sorry.
Jessica1:16:02
Sometimes if you guys didn't get weird. Yes. Just give me one sec. I'll put
the link in the chat. Anybody that's on that file, I can work tomorrow to
get them added to the team site. And then we can always add more people as
needed. What I'll likely do is the business leads. I'll make them owner
access so they can add people as. I don't want to be the person that
everyone wants to go.
Rakesh1:16:28
Right, Right.
Vicki1:16:29
Yeah.
Jessica1:16:31
Yep.
Rakesh1:16:32
Okay, so we got a few actions items to do.
Jessica1:16:35
All righty.
Rakesh1:16:36

<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Discussion on Folder Design:</strong=
><ul>
<li>Initial idea: Folders by business function or by team, with indications=
 for BRV-critical and BRV-adjacent functions/applications.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Feedback from Team:</strong><ul>
<li>Some business functions (e.g., Data &amp; Intelligence) are not directl=
y touched for BRV (Build Release Vehicle), but might be BRV-adjacent (consu=
me information but do not change).</li>
<li>Suggestion to separate BRV and Non-BRV tracks at the highest folder lev=
el for clarity.</li>
<li>Within BRV: Organize primarily by process (e.g., order-to-cash, procure=
-to-pay), not system.</li>
<li>For end-to-end process testing, map as a business scenario (crossing mu=
ltiple systems/workstreams).</li>
<li>For Non-BRV: Keep system-level folders, as these are typically about ap=
plication migrations/=E2=80=9Clift and shift=E2=80=9D events.</li>
<li>Decision: For BRV, have top-level folders by process and also three IT =
workstream folders (ERP, Finance, HR) for functional tests.</li>
<li>Reviewed the need for clarity between end-to-end process testing vs. fu=
nctional testing within each business function.</li>
<li>Highlighted the challenge of tracking =E2=80=9Cadjacent=E2=80=9D system=
s (downstream data/reporting that is not physically changing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Non-BRV Folder Logic:</strong><ul>
<li>Every system (including those not BRV-critical) gets a folder in Non-BR=
V.</li>
<li>For HR and Finance (where only some systems are BRV-critical), systems =
are split across BRV and Non-BRV.</li>

<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">End-to-End vs. Functional Tests:</st=
rong><ul>
<li>End-to-end test scripts will cross multiple systems; folders organized =
around business processes.</li>
<li>Functional scripts are specific to ERP, Finance, HR =E2=80=93 placed in=
 their respective folders.</li>
<li>Confirmed there are five primary end-to-end processes for BRV.</li>
<li>For Non-BRV, focus is on each application=E2=80=99s migration (with pro=

<li>No direct changes for BRV =E2=80=94 these systems are only consumers fo=

<li>For BRV: UAT and SIT timelines are condensed (roughly 2=E2=80=934 weeks=

<li>Each folder to include a =E2=80=98Schedule=E2=80=99 subfolder for team-=

<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">TOSCA Use:</strong><ul>
<li>TOSCA, an automation tool, will be used for SIT and potentially UAT.</l=

<li>For SIT, automation team runs, business validates outputs if needed.</l=

for, I just need to maybe double click into how you&#39;re thinking about t=
he folder structure. So for example, supply chain is going to have end to e=
nd processes, say order to cash. That will involve some commercial systems,=
 some supply chain systems, some finance systems, etc. So how would we. So =
on this, let&#39;s say on this slide, you see that the BRV from a systems p=
erspective, it&#39;s hr, finance and supply chain fundamentally foundationa=
lly changing. Now, the BRV at adjacents are the other systems that they&#39=
;ll touch as part of their testing. So how do we want to then track it? Bec=
ause let&#39;s say, I give you. Let&#39;s say as part of this, they look at=
 some downstream reports. So they need to use Snowflake to look at it. And =
so Data and intelligence is another work stream, but there&#39;s nothing ch=
anging in data and intelligence for 8.1. So how do we want to track that? M=
aybe that&#39;s not an answer for now, but I don&#39;t know if we want to p=
ut it from. Because we bifurcated this into BRV and non brv. So this struct=
ure will be very good for non brv where you actually have the migrations of=
 applications that will have to go through SIT and uat.</div></div><div sty=

these others commercial that are touched where when they run these end to e=

internally they will touch these systems. Now there&#39;s also perhaps func=

 for data and intelligence work stream? So we can ask those sort of questio=

are technically not shown in this presentation. Or maybe I&#39;m missing th=

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">These, the end to en=
d processes are being identified by functions. So say supply chain, supply =
chain has end to end processes. They take those processes and sub processes=
 and Map them to. I need to run order management as a, as a sub process for=
 me to do order management, I&#39;m going to touch seven systems. One of th=
em is ERP system, one of them is a commercial system, one of them is a data=
 analytics system, etc. So when I run the process and the scenario for orde=
r management, I&#39;m going to run that scenario and the test case will. Fo=
r that order management end to end. I&#39;m not going to necessarily have a=
 test case to say ERP or this or that. I&#39;m going to run that scenario t=
hat says, or the test script that says go to this system, do this, place an=
 order, go to this system, execute the order, go to this system, get the ou=
tput report. So for brv, I think it&#39;s easier for us to track it by proc=
ess. And then for these, specifically for these other areas, for these thre=
e IT work streams listed and they&#39;re actually, maybe we should not call=
 them business function because they&#39;re actually IT work streams, IT Fi=

folders that I think belong in each of these folders. But I want to talk th=
rough this and then I can copy and Paste them in. First one is UAT test scr=
ipt. I think that&#39;s a given. We need that for every single sub function=
, secondary function and then process are going to want to have a schedule =
and a reporting folder. But Rakesh, I want to talk through this with you a =
bit. Little bit. Because assumption is that each of these teams are going t=
o have their own schedule. Yes, they&#39;ll. They&#39;ll roll up into your =
high level schedule. But I would expect that each one should have their own=
 schedule and expect for them to be doing some level of daily updating whic=
h is why I wanted to have either a scheduled folder and. Or if they&#39;re =
going to put their actual whatever they&#39;re tracked in, pretend it&#39;s=
 out Excel file. And that&#39;s fine to mostly be a folder, but I would exp=
ect there to be a schedule in there. Does that make sense?</div></div><div =

s. Give me one second. Sorry, just someone at the door but. And then the re=
st of it, the day one stuff is actually migration that&#39;s happening betw=

truly come out of that ERP team that provides that testing schedule literal=

non BRV is all these different work streams will migrate at a different tim=

o they&#39;ll all have their own schedules which will be in the regular tra=

be a little bit.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;b=

 I believe the latest conversation Vicki, with Sukai this afternoon. Aftern=
oon was that TOSCA is still a go and that it will actually accelerate our r=
eadiness. It&#39;s not going to be a negative. There&#39;s no logins requir=
ed, no training required because the automation team is going to execute ev=
erything in Tosca and then the function functional teams are actually just =
going to go in and if there&#39;s any defects or any, you know, failed test=
s, they will validate the implementation inputs and outputs and then they w=
ill provide the corrections. And then the Tosca, the AI team, the test team=
 will run those scripts and automate them again. So it looks like TOSCA is =
still a go and TOSCA will be able to provide that full details and the repo=
rting out of it. As I ran three scenarios today, I ran 20 test scripts. 19 =
of them passed, one of them failed. Here was a SEP3 defect, etc.</div></div=

 is going to be run with tsca the output comes out, we give it to the busin=
ess and we say compare this to the scenario. Is it right or is it wrong? An=
d you&#39;re right, that means that it&#39;s just. We&#39;re just testing t=
he out the outcome. But the understanding was is if the systems in the midd=
le were not changing, it didn&#39;t. It was no harm, no foul. If we let aut=
omation run the scripts, get the outcome and let the business do it. If the=
 systems are changing then that&#39;s a different scenario that the system,=
 you know, we&#39;re doing a script, the systems are changing and just to g=
et the outcome for the business to validate that&#39;s a different story. B=
ut so I think you have a valid point but we need to understand back to whic=
h system what what&#39;s changing and what&#39;s not Changing because Taska=
 can really speed us up for those systems that aren&#39;t changing to run i=
t and get our scripts and all that and let the business validate. But when =
it comes to those systems changing it is another scenario.</div></div><div =

going to be available? If the expectation is that Oscar is going to run scr=
ipts and business just needs to validate, we just can use a couple of days =
out there and say, hey, this is going to all get executed. We will have the=
 outputs here, come back out here and take over, validate this and sign off=

run the scripts over the weekend because it&#39;s automated, come back on t=

ther you come in remotely and test it or validate it or in their. I think t=
he point is July 4th, the US teams are out for extended time. So you can ab=

 understanding of when we&#39;re leveraging task of when we&#39;re not and =
if we&#39;re not what we&#39;re what the plan is because the defect intake =
planner. I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on this, obviously, but we may no=
t need that if we&#39;re going to use task. So I just want to make sure tha=
t we&#39;re aligned with that and we&#39;re not communicating something out=
 that we don&#39;t need to. But the second thing, which I think is a little=
 bit more important is I have questions around mos. One around meeting cade=
nces and two, around what communication reporting we need. Again, understan=
ding TOSCA better will help because if we can pull a report from TASCA and =
has everybody in there, great. But and I think Vicki touched upon this in s=
ome of our earlier calls. We need to probably set up a daily call with thes=
e teams to say, hey, our expectations get through this. Or if we need somet=
hing from them, like if our plan is to have them update their schedule on a=
 daily basis, we need that MOS identified and ready to run probably in the =

at. From a business from a functional perspective, we have the function lea=

. Outside that, I don&#39;t have a list of all the functional users or test=
ers yet. Like who&#39;s a primary. Who&#39;s secondary. Once those names co=
me in over the next couple of days, those can also be added on there. So it=
 may be a bit iterative, but we have an initial list to start with and then=

 can give us an Excel list of across these 26 countries. These are the loca=

cross, you know, some form or fashion they will support the HR payroll test=

imilarly for the process supply chain may have, you know, these functional =
leads as well as additional testers. So all of those along with the leads c=

certainly had to crop. But this is what Mac created for BRV and non brv. So=
 we have a similar one for non brv. So we&#39;ve got as you can see, the sa=
me list of the eight or nine work streams and actually maybe we should call=
 them work streams 80 plus systems in play. We&#39;ve got, you know, their =
disposition, their, you know, work stream lead, IT lead service owner who m=
ay or may not need access to this. The Athens IT lead planned sit, start an=
d end dates. These come from their work plans. But we&#39;re taking and doi=
ng an exercise to validate this with each of these work stream leads and th=
en test resource. They have two for primary, secondary. This is more of a t=
racker here. Again, we wanted to do this as a readiness and execution track=
er so that we can run some bi on this. The expectation was that this will r=
eside in Capital Edge right now in smartsheets, but it could go into an inv=
entory in capital Edge where you can run some reports for readiness. But th=
e ask is okay, find the function lead, testing resources, test, start, end.=
 The ones in greens have been validated with the fun with the work streams.=
 But then, you know, align on schedule, test scripts, environment, data acc=
ess. So again, this is probably not needed because I think the answer would=
 be tosca and you know, etc. So this is the tracker we&#39;re having them f=
ill out. And so we want to start running some reporting on this for readine=
ss. Purely for readiness. Right. And then certainly into an execution to sa=
y, you know, once the schedule is aligned, you know, how many, what is the,=
 what is the percentage complete, etc. If there are other places we can do =
this easier and not make this redundant, then we can certainly do that beca=
use there isn&#39;t one. Right now we&#39;re creating this tracker and havi=
