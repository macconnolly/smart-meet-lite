Main Topics Discussed

   1.

   Stranded Costs Assessment for Move and Build Back Scenarios
   - For applications moving =E2=80=9Cas is=E2=80=9D into the TSA (Transiti=
on Service
      Agreement), no stranded costs are expected, as hardware, software, an=
d
      associated labor move with them.
      - Shared resources with Honeywell are part of the process, and in
      dedicated moves, there is also no stranded cost.
      - In build back cases (setting up new versions or moving to new
      infrastructure, such as the Honeywell Athens Infrastructure
Landing Zone),
      there=E2=80=99s little to no stranded cost for hardware or software l=
icenses, but
      validation is needed.
      - It=E2=80=99s noted that some costs (such as new database or hardwar=
e
      licensing) could arise and need estimating.
   2.

   Data Collection and Validation Status
   - Andrew has provided contract and licensing information for the top
      30=E2=80=9335 vendors (~80% of revenue/contract costs); considered so=
lid but
      requires further validation.
      - For hardware, conversations with the DCN (Data Center Networking)
      team revealed figures of around 70 databases and 200=E2=80=93320 serv=
ers
supporting
      Athens under one Honeywell contract.
      - Some assets may not be needed after migration, so estimating
      live-without costs is important.
      - For labor, information is still lacking, especially on shared IT
      services. Honeywell has about 2,200 IT shared services staff; roughly=
 10%
      (220 FTEs) are attributed to Athens. The fate of these resources
(internal
      transfer, external hiring, or stranding) remains to be clarified.
   3.

   Gaps and Validation Requirements
   - Labor cost (both internal and external) is identified as a major gap
      and likely the most significant unknown.
      - Hardware and some software license inventory and cost attribution
      require further work.
      - Arpit highlighted that all current data needs to be pulled out and
      revalidated, as licensing, software, and hardware components in the
      existing model are not comprehensive or up to date.
      - The need to clarify what portion of total resources (FTEs vs.
      contractors/NTIs) are relevant.
   4.

   Next Steps and Action Plan
   - Identify data gaps and clarify with relevant teams (e.g., Sewerage for
      enterprise IT, DCN for hardware).
      - Develop a clear game plan for data collection and validation in the
      lead-up to June 20th.
      - Prepare templates (as suggested by Arpit) for data requests,
      standardizing inputs by function, and disseminate to relevant parties=
 for
      streamlined collection.
      - Use SharePoint or similar tools for centralized data gathering and
      ease of collaboration.
      - Differentiate between data required for TSA/Day 1 scenarios and
      post-TSA/day 2 activities, prioritizing immediate needs but also
preparing
      views for later periods.
   5.

   Timeline and Coordination
   - The group aims to have an updated version of the data and model, with
      at least 40% completeness and a clear articulation of gaps, by June 2=
0th.
      - The goal is not a final product but a version with greater data
      depth and clearer assumptions to present to Sukai and other stakehold=
ers.
   6.

   Challenges Noted
   - Team resource constraints (due to absences and unclear roles).
      - Difficulty in parsing and standardizing unstructured incoming data.
      - Importance of validating assumed =E2=80=9Cnot applicable=E2=80=9D (=
N/A) stranded
      costs.

Action Items

   - Validate all current hardware, software, and labor data received
   (especially from Andrew and DCN).
   - Complete gap analysis for missing labor and hardware information
   (particularly the shared IT labor component).
   - Develop and distribute standardized templates for data collection by
   function/team.
   - Follow up with relevant stakeholders (including Arpit, Sewerage, DCN)
   on outstanding data needs.
   - Prioritize validation for TSA/Day 1, but also document what will need
   to be addressed post-TSA exit.
   - Convene regular check-ins leading up to June 20th to coordinate
   progress and adjust plans as needed.

Key Figures and Dates

   - 70 build back applications (number suggested for discussion purposes).
   - 200=E2=80=93320 servers supporting Athens under Honeywell contract.
   - 2,200 Honeywell IT shared services staff; 220 potentially relevant for
   Athens.
   - June 20th: Target date to have a more complete and validated data view=
.

=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager0:00
Nothing there right now. Because these guys are all going to be in a TSA
and they're going to be charged.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate0:05
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager0:06
From a build back move as is, they're essentially no stranded cost because
these are usually. These are shared. Well, the portion of this is they're
shared with Honeywell. They're building them back in a newer version or
moving them. If they're dedicated, they're moving as is, which means
there's no. But let's even say for the sake of argument, for the sake of
discussion, let's put 70 build back. I'm just throwing out numbers out
there. Move as is for the build backs. We need to understand if there's.
For the move as is, these are all dedicated to Athens. So there's nothing
really as a stranded cost. So there won't be any stranded cost for hardware
software license because everything is moved over. Yeah.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate1:01
There are no veto.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager1:02
So they're no vedant labor too. The build back is one we need to look at
and see, okay, what was the existing why are we building it back? And if
they are, then in that case they're essentially almost the same as moving
some of the hardware off and building it in the Honeywell Athens
infrastructure landing zone instead of Honeywell. So there's potentially
nothing there in terms of hardware, in terms of software license. We need
to validate if there is.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate1:31
Yeah, I would say yes, yes and yes.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager1:33
Right. So potentially. And there may be hardware as well if you need to get
a database license or a hardware license or something.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate1:42
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager1:43
Tsa, nothing for now. So if I break it up from an app perspective, I get
this view across these components and I know that we have for contracts,
Andrew, at least for the top 30 or top 35 vendors that constituted 80% of
the revenue or 80% of the contract costs. He gave us those numbers of what
the story is. These are good numbers for software. I think he gave us
licensing numbers as well. And we may need to look at it from these guys.
If we can get it from her.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate2:18
Yeah, that was great. Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager2:19
The other 200, if we can get some numbers from here, we should do that.
Yeah, Hardware. We have to talk to the DCN team and we've talked to them in
the context of TSAs and said in your database, in your data centers, how
many servers are supporting Athens? And they said like 320 or something or
maybe 200 something. They said, okay, we've got like 70 databases and 200
servers or something that support Athens in the universe. And that's all
under one Honeywell Contract. So if they're moving away, some of these are
not there, but some of these for the live without. We need to understand
what that cost is and put some estimates of what it can be.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate2:57
So DCN maps to hardware.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager2:59
So DCN is data center networking that maps to data and then there's also
DCN and then there's database or what they call ima Information Management.
The asan, it's their business unit or it's. So it's IMA is data databases.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate3:19
Okay.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager3:19
So they've got some SQL servers and some Linux servers and some, you know,
Oracle databases that are supported. But now if they live without, we'll
need to. So and then labor, of course we're getting from sewerage. Maybe we
should get the other hundred from storage. The guy on the call so we've got
for this. He gave us for these. We probably need some. Some views as well.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate3:46
Yeah, I would like. I mean you need it for all this. That's going to be a.
I think labor is probably the, the biggest gap. Yeah. Because. And
especially like the shared aspect, like all of the shared support.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager4:00
So Honeywell has 2200 IT shared services and the corporate IT. I think I
mentioned this to you the earlier in the conversation. Athens is generally
10% of the business.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate4:13
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager4:14
So there was an expectation that 220 people from our corporate IT would
move over into Athens. And so they have been interviewing for jobs, etc. So
any 220 is it stranded for them? They haven't gotten that many. They're
going to go externally higher. But the point remains that some of those
people salary we don't know. But the point is they have given us a view
that says I have four resources doing eight hours a week support. So we may
need to make some assumptions and say this person is 200k a year or 150k a
year.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate4:47
Is that 2200ftes or 2200 including like the NTIs and the HCLS?
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager4:55
These are. Good question. I think they're shared for. They're probably FTEs=
.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate4:59
Okay.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager5:00
So they're all internal and they're looking to get them hired.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate5:03
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager5:03
So they're not the LTIs and TCs.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate5:06
So that's. That's again. Yes. Then that's the other one we need.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager5:10
Yes, that's internal and external.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate5:12
Yeah. So internal 2200 10% and whatever the net they hire externally
they're going to. That those people are definitely going to be stranded.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager5:24
Because the question is in some cases we need to chase that and see if are
they doing innovating or assigning NTT contracts and saying if Athens is
getting a new entity contract, are some of those people moving over or is
some of that cost moving over here? Yeah, so that's a longer tail that we
need to chase as well. So. So we do have a view. This is good. This is.
This is fairly much more solid numbers from Andrew. So not everything needs
to be. Do they need to be validated? Yes, but we shouldn't start. The
model's good. We've got some data. We need to run it to ground and then
chase the others.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate6:05
Okay.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager6:06
So they are. They are good numbers from Andrew because we're using those
numbers for other purposes here. So they're valid numbers. It doesn't help
when half the team is out, but I was hoping that they'd use the data. They
leveraged the data that we received and filled it in and really only talked
about the gaps. But.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate6:40
Yeah, and that's kind of what I was alluding to earlier is that I haven't
really gotten a sense for what are the actual gaps. I mean, I know just by
talking it through with you, what are the gaps, but I would like to hear
from like Arpit, who has been in it, what are the gaps? And he highlighted
labor, but he also highlighted. He said everything in here needs to be
pulled out and revalidated. The licensing details from Andrew. The latest
hasn't been pulled in. The software hasn't been pulled in.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager7:17
Hardware stranded needs a lot of work.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate7:19
Yeah, hardware we need. And then labor internal and external.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager7:23
So we pretty much. So he is somewhat right in that the model is a model,
but the data needs to be really built up.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate7:32
Exactly.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager7:33
So, so let's talk through how we're going to do that. One, get the gaps.
But two, let's game plan what we're going to do over the next few weeks to
start having the conversations on these. VAL seems to be a good example.
She's not doing just. She may be doing ccx, but she may be doing
everything. We have to see if she's only on CCX or sewerage, for example,
will be able to get us this data for all of this at least enterprise it.
And then we start working with DC and let's. So let's game plan who we
should reach out to, how often. What is our plan over the next three, four
weeks to get to, let's say June, June 20th and beyond. We don't have much
time for June 20th, but we should at least start having views to say we're
showing we don't need a version final. We need a version that's better than
us.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate8:25
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager8:26
What we have today with more data.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate8:27
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager8:28
That we can go back to Sukai and say, hey, listen, we've got 40% of the
data. We know where the gaps are. We're chasing them. We'll get a better
view for you, but here's how it's shaping up.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate8:38
Yeah. What does the variance look like?
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager8:40
What is it? Yeah. Are we in the ballpark directionally? Are we trending the
right way? Are our assumptions. Okay, so, so yeah, let's. Let's put it in a
bit more visually form like this, and let's start looking at what is
missing. What do we need to validate? I mean, there's a valid. Maybe we
qualify these things and say needed.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate9:12
Yeah. Like have needed.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager9:13
Have, but needs validation. Don't have, not needed. Have. Need validation.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate9:24
Well, hardware we don't have.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager9:27
Okay, so then.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate9:28
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We need hardware. Yeah. Hardware I'd put. Need
software licensing. I put. Have, need validation. Same with a license. Yeah=
.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager9:43
This is not. I would almost say we do need these for. Not for today. So
this is for day one and this is post day one. So in fact, everything is,
you know.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate10:13
Yeah. Because we'll get to post day one and then we need to talk about the
mitigators.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager10:19
Yeah. So it may not be an urgent one, but we can prioritize this and say,
I've covered it on tsa, it's not a stranded for now, but six months. When
they exit tsa, they need to go through this exercise for it. So we might as
well give a view of it. So we can perhaps have this as a second priority.
Chase the others and say, okay, for this we've got TSA and standalone.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate10:45
Yes. TSA hardware need. Eventually.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager10:50
Yeah, this we need build back. We need. And this we have, I think, build
back hardware. Yeah, build back hardware. The run cost teams are giving us
the operating run cost. So there's not necessarily a stranded against the
honeymoon.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate11:10
So then I'd go na.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager11:11
So we may have, you know, it may be an na. Yeah, these are na, but we
should validate, you know, which is absolutely na.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate11:21
Yeah. And that's the big asterisks at the bottom is like validate nas.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager11:26
Yeah, validate. So he's not wrong in that we need to validate everything.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate11:30
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager11:32
But we at least have a shell and we have a framework to do this.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate11:35
And then the labor internal and external across the board, we.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager11:39
This is need.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate11:39
Yeah, need.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager11:45
And so for everything. Need. But we need a game plan for when will we
complete this validation and when we're going to go chase this.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate11:53
Yeah. And how I would like to give them a template like in the. Arpit had
good templates for standalone that were by function and I would like
templates for something similar to put out that ask for and then you can
just send it around to all of the functions. Like. Like we need your labor
costs for everything that we decide we need. Where the gaps are. Just have
a template that's like a data request and then you start sending that
around to people, stick it in SharePoint and exactly. Let them go fill it.
Because that was Arpit's second gripe was that all of the data we're
getting part of or a big portion of the lift that we have is parsing
through it and filtering it out. And so if we can get ahead of that by
saying here's the template that we want it in and it's standardized, you
know where your inputs are and they're structured the same and that gets
you over the second hurdle.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager13:02
Okay. So take that template and see if you want to do it in the tabs.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate13:06
If you want to do it.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager13:07
Yeah, if that's easier to get the info, then absolutely.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate13:11
Yeah.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager13:12
And then they can all go work on. Each one can be on a different tab to
work.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate13:15
Exactly.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager13:17
All right.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate13:18
Okay. Lunch?
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager13:19
Oh yeah, I need to order.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate13:22
I got, I got Sean on there.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager13:23
Okay. He was supposed to be here.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate13:25
I saw him. He was hanging out out there on the phone.
Unknown_Senior_Analyst_or_Project_Manager13:29
Oh, ok.
Unknown_Colleague_or_Project_Associate13:52
It.

requires further validation.</li>
<li>For hardware, conversations with the DCN (Data Center Networking) team =
revealed figures of around 70 databases and 200=E2=80=93320 servers support=
ing Athens under one Honeywell contract.</li>
<li>Some assets may not be needed after migration, so estimating live-witho=
ut costs is important.</li>
<li>For labor, information is still lacking, especially on shared IT servic=
es. Honeywell has about 2,200 IT shared services staff; roughly 10% (220 FT=
Es) are attributed to Athens. The fate of these resources (internal transfe=
r, external hiring, or stranding) remains to be clarified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Gaps and Validation Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor cost (both internal and external) is identified as a major gap an=
d likely the most significant unknown.</li>
<li>Hardware and some software license inventory and cost attribution requi=
re further work.</li>
<li>Arpit highlighted that all current data needs to be pulled out and reva=
lidated, as licensing, software, and hardware components in the existing mo=
del are not comprehensive or up to date.</li>
<li>The need to clarify what portion of total resources (FTEs vs. contracto=
rs/NTIs) are relevant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Next Steps and Action Plan</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify data gaps and clarify with relevant teams (e.g., Sewerage for =
enterprise IT, DCN for hardware).</li>
<li>Develop a clear game plan for data collection and validation in the lea=
d-up to June 20th.</li>
<li>Prepare templates (as suggested by Arpit) for data requests, standardiz=
ing inputs by function, and disseminate to relevant parties for streamlined=
 collection.</li>
<li>Use SharePoint or similar tools for centralized data gathering and ease=
 of collaboration.</li>
<li>Differentiate between data required for TSA/Day 1 scenarios and post-TS=
A/day 2 activities, prioritizing immediate needs but also preparing views f=
or later periods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Timeline and Coordination</p>
<ul>
<li>The group aims to have an updated version of the data and model, with a=
t least 40% completeness and a clear articulation of gaps, by June 20th.</l=
i>
<li>The goal is not a final product but a version with greater data depth a=
nd clearer assumptions to present to Sukai and other stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Challenges Noted</p>
<ul>
<li>Team resource constraints (due to absences and unclear roles).</li>
<li>Difficulty in parsing and standardizing unstructured incoming data.</li=
>
<li>Importance of validating assumed =E2=80=9Cnot applicable=E2=80=9D (N/A)=
 stranded costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Action Items</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate all current hardware, software, and labor data received (espec=
ially from Andrew and DCN).</li>
<li>Complete gap analysis for missing labor and hardware information (parti=
cularly the shared IT labor component).</li>
<li>Develop and distribute standardized templates for data collection by fu=
nction/team.</li>
<li>Follow up with relevant stakeholders (including Arpit, Sewerage, DCN) o=
n outstanding data needs.</li>
<li>Prioritize validation for TSA/Day 1, but also document what will need t=
o be addressed post-TSA exit.</li>
<li>Convene regular check-ins leading up to June 20th to coordinate progres=
s and adjust plans as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Figures and Dates</p>
<ul>
<li>70 build back applications (number suggested for discussion purposes).<=

ould like to give them a template like in the. Arpit had good templates for=
 standalone that were by function and I would like templates for something =
similar to put out that ask for and then you can just send it around to all=
 of the functions. Like. Like we need your labor costs for everything that =
we decide we need. Where the gaps are. Just have a template that&#39;s like=
 a data request and then you start sending that around to people, stick it =
in SharePoint and exactly. Let them go fill it. Because that was Arpit&#39;=
s second gripe was that all of the data we&#39;re getting part of or a big =
portion of the lift that we have is parsing through it and filtering it out=
. And so if we can get ahead of that by saying here&#39;s the template that=
 we want it in and it&#39;s standardized, you know where your inputs are an=
d they&#39;re structured the same and that gets you over the second hurdle.=
