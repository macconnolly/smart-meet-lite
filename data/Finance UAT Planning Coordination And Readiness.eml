*Meeting Summary: Finance UAT Planning & Readiness Coordination (Ahead of
June 11th, 2025 Finance Call)*
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Debrief from Prior Conversations

   - Paul is overwhelmed, similar to others, with multiple topics including
   sows and UAT.
   - Additional details on sows to come.

2. Preparation for Tomorrow=E2=80=99s Finance Call

   - Will (the finance lead) is very risk-averse, detail-oriented, and
   insistent on clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and processes.
   - The approach for the finance UAT call should be similar to the method
   used in today=E2=80=99s session, with improved focus and streamlined dis=
cussions.
   - Attendance by IT service owners is expected.

3. Presentation Deck Updates (=E2=80=9CFinancifying the Deck=E2=80=9D)

   - Action to update the existing deck and tailor (=E2=80=9Cfinancify=E2=
=80=9D) for the
   finance audience.
      - Retitle the deck (e.g., =E2=80=9CFinance Deck=E2=80=9D) and adjust =
the first page.
      - Specific slides (notably slides 3, 4, and 9) need modifications for
      finance context.
      - Finance has its own testing calendar=E2=80=94most finance UAT will =
occur in
      September and October 2025.
      - Entry and exit criteria, as well as test scenarios and test scripts
      alignment, are important topics for discussion.
      - =E2=80=98Logistics and Next Steps=E2=80=99 section should be enhanc=
ed to address
      Will=E2=80=99s concerns about credentials, locations, test environmen=
t,
and process.

4. Test Scenarios, Test Scripts, and Cross-team Alignment

   - ERP has developed comprehensive test scripts (across all functions,
   including finance).
   - Finance will share their test scenarios; alignment is needed to ensure
   all scenarios are covered by test scripts.
      - Example: 100 finance scenarios may require 300 test scripts across
      seven to nine systems.
   - The call=E2=80=99s purpose is to facilitate that alignment and assign =
action
   items to ensure coverage.
   - Test scripts, their housing, and the tools used will be reviewed.

5. Meeting Structure and Participant Management

   - Intent to streamline the discussion:
      - Minimize time spent on systems review (~20=E2=80=9330 min target vs=
. 45 min
      prior experience).
      - Emphasize clarity over volume to avoid confusion stemming from too
      many similar files from previous weeks.
   - Finance call participants: Harry (IT Finance), ERP team members, data,
   etc. Will=E2=80=99s presence is ideal but alternatives will attend if he=
 is out of
   office.

6. Logistics and Housekeeping

   - Clean up and consolidate project files on the Honeywell side to avoid
   recurring confusion.
   - Dashboarding, UAT planning, and action trackers will reside centrally
   (Honeywell), but copies may be shared with other teams (e.g., Capital Ed=
ge).

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Update (=E2=80=9CFinancify=E2=80=9D) the Finance Deck*

      - Ensure reporting responsibilities and updates (UAT testing status,
      KT status, dates, etc.) are clear.
      - Preferred method: request essential personnel to update Smartsheet
      or Excel tracker, possibly supplemented by individual or small
group office
      hours.
   4.

and UAT
      readiness tracker completion:
         - Scheduled for 2:00 PM Eastern on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
         (June 11=E2=80=9313, 2025).
         - Each session (~1 hour) to facilitate efficient data collection
         from app/services owners.
      5.

Cash0:00
How did it go with Paul?
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
0:03
Good. Talking of a few things. Sows and uat and you know, he's overwhelmed
as well. So. Yeah, but yeah, no, so we'll hear more about sows and stuff.
But. But yeah. Good. All right. So we were going to connect. I wanted to
make sure that we've got all our ducks in a row for tomorrow's finance
call. Yeah, this guy Will is very, very particular. He's, you know, he's
even more thorough than. He's very risk averse and he's very, very thorough
and even more thorough than Sriram. So he would want it. And his, he's
very, very picky on roles and responsibilities of what he should do and
others should do. So, you know, he took the time and the effort to define
all these processes and the system systems and everything else. So I want
to make sure that of course our IT service owners hopefully attend, but we,
we should run it similar to what we had today. So if you can. I need three
things. Let me. Let's just put down the list. If you can, update the deck.
So maybe we call it, you know, finance deck or something. For the most part
they'll be the same.
Cash1:19
Yes. Right.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
1:20
Except maybe the first page. Yes.
Cash1:22
And so that was what I wanted to align with you on. I created a copy of the
deck in preparation for it.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
1:28
Do you want to go through that? Yeah, let's just live at it.
Cash1:34
Hold on. I have to. It's on the Honeywell side. Give me one second and I'll
reopen it over there.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
1:39
Okay. Yeah. Can you. I was going to suggest that. Or not. Not just suggest,
but strongly recommend and say that there are a lot of files that are
titled similar just historically in the past, over the last few weeks. So
I'd like to clean all that up because they all seem to have similar content
but presented to different people in different days. So it's quite
confusing when I see UAT planning kick off it. UAT planning. It bre. UAT
planning and it's like, you know, so there's some little housekeeping we
need to do, but I'd like us to stay on Honeywell where we can because these
guys are always pinging me and saying, where's this? Where's that? So just
move all your dashboarding and everything else that you need to with.
Obviously you can keep a copy of it when we talk to Capital Edge team, but
let's get comfortable working with the Honeywell side of things. Yep.
Cash2:39
I just pinged you the link and it's opening. I See this all right now on my
side. So I haven't, I haven't financedified it yet, but I just created it
as a placeholder.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
2:49
Okay, so let's look at through it. Slide 3 needs to be financified.
Cash2:53
Yep.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
2:56
Slide 4, this may or may not work for them because for finance. Well, let's
see what it is. We'll give them this. But they have their own finance has
its own testing calendar. And where they'll need things, there are some
finance that will be tested in August, but most of the finance will be
tested in probably September and October. But that's what we need to talk
to them about. Because if there's an action item that says finance, we need
to update the calendars for uat, for their UAT in September, October, we
should talk to it. He would like to talk about entry exit criteria because
his POCs would likely work with the service owners. So Harry's POCs to
define this. He's big on test scripts, so particularly on test scenarios,
one of the things that we need to look at is they have developed test
scenarios. It's likely that they will share those test scenarios and they
will want to understand from Harry and the team, or even the ERP team, when
those test scenarios would be translated to test scripts and where they
would be housed, what tools they're using, etc. Etc. Let me take a pause
there, see if you have any thoughts, reactions.
Cash4:29
Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, do we want, do we have enough, do we have
any of that content or any of those details to run through it here? And
like, what's the objective with that.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
4:43
Finance or with what?
Cash4:45
With like the test scripts. Right. So what's the purpose of bringing the
test scripts into this call and what value can we get out of that?
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
4:54
So, okay, so it's not bringing test scripts in the sense similar to what
you heard on the call today, that ERP has developed test scripts, that
they're going to share that with ISC next week, mid next week is what I
heard, that ERP test scripts run the gamut of all the functions, supply
chain, finance, etc. So if finance has defined test scenarios, then those
test scenarios need to be aligned with these IT functions to translate them
to test scripts.
Cash5:28
Got it.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
5:29
So if ERPs already develop test scripts, they need to quickly align with
finance to understand whether their test scripts match or reflect the
scenarios these guys have developed. So if I have 100 scenarios, and I need
300 test scripts against those scenarios for these seven systems that they
use, or nine systems whatever is in their Excel or in their PowerPoint,
then I need to know, okay, I've got 300 test scripts, ERP, what have you
done? If you've developed test scripts, do those line up to the 300? I need
how many of them match, how many of them you need to develop, how many of
them you need to redo. So the conversation in bringing that is to align
both of them and say, can you do a follow up call or here's a test script,
or here's the test scenarios rather, erp, you need to tell us if these line
up with the test scripts.
Cash6:28
Okay, that makes sense. So how does that change our agenda then? Or I guess
we have the slide in here on, let me see, we.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
6:39
Have the test scenario, it's just review test scenario and approach and we
just talk through it.
Cash6:46
Yeah.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
6:47
The other part that he will particularly talk about is logistics. So I'm
going to add this as logistics and next steps because he will want to
particularly know and I hope I invited the same people for tomorrow. Who do
I have here? Do I have Mickey Vincent? Okay. They're all there for finance
call as well. Okay. Because he will want to know about SSO's logins. He's
very, very picky. You know, what credentials are they going to use, what
laptops will they use, what locations will they be in? You know, how will
this test be run? Will it be virtual or can they go in? What environment
will you use? So there'll be a lot more detailed conversations with these
guys around that historically they're wanting that information, they want
to get all of that information as much as possible. Excuse me. Before they
go into, you know, before they get to a comfort level. Okay. So I expect a
call to go that way and you know, the systems, hopefully we take a few
minutes to discuss the Systems and not 45 like we did today. Granted
there's, you know, 40, 40 systems and so many stakeholders, but hopefully
it's four or five people and you know, it's finance, it's, it's Harry and
erp and they're done and data and I don't think data showed up. So. So
yeah, so. So yeah, we do need, you know, I'm hoping that we spend 20
minutes maybe to talk through the systems, maybe 30 of the max and then
spend the remaining time talking through the rest of this stuff.
Cash8:50
Perfect.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
8:51
So it will be similar to now we'll have to share the screen, we'll have to
walk through the Excel, we'll have to complete action items and notes there
and Then move on to. I expect him really well to drive a lot of the
conversation on what are logistics, who do I talk to, who are my people
working with, yada, yada. So he's very, very methodical in that sense. If
he is on the call or he's out of office.
Cash9:22
So you think Will might be out of office.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
9:26
I know he's out of office this week, so if he shows up, great. But we've
got other, the other people he's nominated to show up and we've got other
people to be there. So. Yeah. So I do want to make sure that we do run it
well tomorrow as well and have the content and be able to quickly move
through content. And today was a bit of a learning in terms of too many
people. It's nice that everybody asks questions, but it pushed all the
conversations to 45 minutes of just dealing with 10 systems.
Cash10:04
Yeah. They also have so many systems and I mean just like the scope at NISC
is different from finance, so hopefully that portion of the call won't take
as long as.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
10:19
Yeah, yeah.
Cash10:21
Is at least my thinking.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
10:24
Yeah.
Cash10:25
Okay, so action on me then to financify. Two, three, one.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
10:36
One is fine. Well, 11th. Yeah, yeah. Two, three, five. Yep. You can leave
the ERP finance. That's there. And then six, seven, eight probably are
there. Nine is going to be. Yeah, that's fine. Nine is, is. Okay, so.
Cash11:06
Got it.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
11:07
And then we will let them. So very similar. It's coordination, it's letting
these people talk and just making sure that we capture it and saying, okay,
you guys are finally talking. Let's set up a cadence.
Cash11:21
Okay.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
11:25
And you'll see as they did today, that it's just conversations bubbling up
and people expressing, you know, being scared about some things. Like the
site guys, those guys freaked out. There's probably education for them to
say, hey, nothing much is really happening for you guys. Don't worry about
it. But the sites are quite nervy when some systems that they touch are
changing and nobody's told them about it.
Cash11:53
Yeah.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
11:55
Which is always the case with supply chain manufacturing. So. So yeah, so
finance, there are not going to be any sites. This is all top level
financial consolidation reporting. How do I file my management reporting
and financial close and all that. So how do I collect cash? So hopefully
there won't be any site level, but there will be database analytics. There
will be erp, there will be IT finance. So yeah, perfect. All right, so I
think we have some marching orders on that. So yeah, financify this
particular deck, save it in a different name or call it Finance. Well, you
know, call it Finance. I think you have. I do want you to. I didn't see an
email come through but if you can get with the Capital Edge team so that
they can get moving to get that reporting done quickly.
Cash12:51
Yeah, the one thing I wanted to align with you on there before I speak with
him is I guess the how we will capture the updates. Right. So we have the
model but I was trying to think through in my head where we will get
updates from them on the data. Like are we going to really request that
folks come in and update smartsheet like our. Like a smartsheet with this
data model and provide updates on UAT testing status, KT status testing
dates, et cetera. Is that a realistic ask?
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
13:34
Well, we have to make it. Otherwise we do some office hours with them and
say this is a one time effort. We want to do this half an hour with you.
Let's go through this. We could take a pass at this and say, listen, I'm
only dealing with 82 apps. Let me filter through that. And If I've got 30
of them commercial, then I talk to Steven for half an hour. If I got 25 of
them, erp, I talk to SRI and Bill for half an hour and maybe we do office
hours over the next. What's today, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, we
do office hours half an hour, pull them in individually and then say okay,
populate this for me and live edit and work with them an hour each and then
get all that in and say this is what we're going to do, we're going to
track it, we're going to do this. Can you fill this all up for us? Can we
live edit and do that as part of office hours?
Cash14:29
Yeah, we can do that.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
14:30
That's probably easier than getting 50 people on a call and saying or
sending it to them. They don't react well, they never get to it. But I
think you know the three leads now. So. So just filter through what
functions we need for those 80 something apps. I presume it's the 80
something that we need to fill out.
Cash14:50
Exactly.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
14:51
Or do we need it for the others?
Cash14:53
We need the 87 to start with especially just like the core details. Right,
like the testing schedules and the.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
15:03
KT, the service owner. So the 87 is probably priority and as part of that
maybe we say hey Steven, listen, by the way, you've got very little and
you've got 30 on a TS TSA. Can you fill out the TSAs as well? Yeah, While
we're here.
Cash15:18
Yeah.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
15:19
So if you can set up so filter through the 82 and see which functions they
are and then we have the names of the work stream leads for each function.
So it's you know, it's Harry for IT Finance, Harry Tong. You saw SRI that
the Bill Ponsetti is the PM there. But you know Srinivas is Sri's perhaps
right hand person to support the engagement. So SRI or Srinivas can answer
ERP and then you've got Steven Brown to answer all of ccex. And then we
probably have a couple of others. Some of these others IT for IT
applications like M365 and Da Da da. You know so those we can also get
Rashid to see who the owners are because he's dealing with some of those IT
for IT applications like sso and some of those if you look at the filter
for the 82, some of them are it for it. They're not business apps, they're
like M365 SharePoint. So we may be able to get names from ratio that pre
populates and then go into these calls as well. Okay, so I would suggest
where we can we pre populate some names et cetera. But if not then maybe we
do this. So we have some time Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So tomorrow
afternoon 1:30 Eastern I'm free. Thursday afternoon 2 Eastern I'm free.
Actually 2 Eastern each day. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is free. So maybe
we book an hour each each day and we we have it call it office hours for
BRB readiness tracker completion.
Cash17:11
Okay, let's do that and then I'll get this sent over.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
17:15
Perfect. So you got two things. Well, three things. Honeywell, financize
the deck, work with the Capital Edge team today. Just my point is we should
get it out of our outbox and into their inbox. Yeah right. So that way it's
not on us to get things out. So whatever you need to do, just get it out to
them today with a model and say this is what I need from you guys. Tell us
know what support and they can always come back.
Cash17:43
Yeah.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
17:44
And then the third part and copy pre on it because she, she runs the
capital ed support. And then the third part is this. Set up office hours
today and placeholder.
Cash17:53
Similar.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
17:55
And put the agenda items we spoke about.
Cash17:58
Sounds great.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
17:59
And if you want to include the BRB tracker in there, we should create the
tracker. Either if it's in an Excel, we create it in Excel and say it's in
Smartsheets or if we have it in smartsheets. We send them the link to the
smartsheets. Do we have it in smartsheets yet?
Cash18:19
We have it. Yes, we do. Actually, I had Justin created in smartsheets, but
the Excel one I think is prettier. It's easier to navigate. Okay, so it's.
And it's in Excel. It's in that Honeywell folder. Yeah.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
18:33
Okay, send them both and say something to the effect of this is going to
reside in smartsheets and report out of it. We are using Excel. We will use
Excel for this exercise size and import it into smartsheets after the call.
Cash18:49
Okay. Okay, sounds great.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
18:51
So, yeah, so get those at least placeholders. We can develop the content
for it tomorrow morning or if there's some content to be done.
Cash18:59
Okay. Yeah, that sounds great.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
19:01
So 2pm Eastern, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday for office hours. Yes.
Cash19:08
Okay. Yeah, that sounds great.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
19:11
All righty.
Cash19:11
I'll get started. Thanks. Thanks for cash. I appreciate it.
Unknown (possibly the team lead or project manager interacting with Cash)
19:14
No worries. All good.

ation (Ahead of June 11th, 2025 Finance Call)</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">Main Topic=
s Discussed</h3><h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5=
rem">1. Debrief from Prior Conversations</h4><ul>
<li>Paul is overwhelmed, similar to others, with multiple topics including =
sows and UAT.</li>
<li>Additional details on sows to come.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">2. Preparat=
ion for Tomorrow=E2=80=99s Finance Call</h4><ul>
<li>Will (the finance lead) is very risk-averse, detail-oriented, and insis=
tent on clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and processes.</li>
<li>The approach for the finance UAT call should be similar to the method u=
sed in today=E2=80=99s session, with improved focus and streamlined discuss=
ions.</li>
<li>Attendance by IT service owners is expected.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">3. Presenta=
tion Deck Updates (=E2=80=9CFinancifying the Deck=E2=80=9D)</h4><ul>
<li>Action to update the existing deck and tailor (=E2=80=9Cfinancify=E2=80=
=9D) for the finance audience.<ul>
<li>Retitle the deck (e.g., =E2=80=9CFinance Deck=E2=80=9D) and adjust the =
first page.</li>
<li>Specific slides (notably slides 3, 4, and 9) need modifications for fin=
ance context.</li>
<li>Finance has its own testing calendar=E2=80=94most finance UAT will occu=
r in September and October 2025.</li>
<li>Entry and exit criteria, as well as test scenarios and test scripts ali=
gnment, are important topics for discussion.</li>
<li>=E2=80=98Logistics and Next Steps=E2=80=99 section should be enhanced t=
o address Will=E2=80=99s concerns about credentials, locations, test enviro=
nment, and process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">4. Test Sce=
narios, Test Scripts, and Cross-team Alignment</h4><ul>
<li>ERP has developed comprehensive test scripts (across all functions, inc=
luding finance). </li>
<li>Finance will share their test scenarios; alignment is needed to ensure =
all scenarios are covered by test scripts.<ul>
<li>Example: 100 finance scenarios may require 300 test scripts across seve=
n to nine systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The call=E2=80=99s purpose is to facilitate that alignment and assign a=
ction items to ensure coverage.</li>
<li>Test scripts, their housing, and the tools used will be reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">5. Meeting =
Structure and Participant Management</h4><ul>
<li>Intent to streamline the discussion: <ul>
<li>Minimize time spent on systems review (~20=E2=80=9330 min target vs. 45=
 min prior experience).</li>
<li>Emphasize clarity over volume to avoid confusion stemming from too many=
 similar files from previous weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finance call participants: Harry (IT Finance), ERP team members, data, =
etc. Will=E2=80=99s presence is ideal but alternatives will attend if he is=
 out of office.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">6. Logistic=
s and Housekeeping</h4><ul>
<li>Clean up and consolidate project files on the Honeywell side to avoid r=
ecurring confusion.</li>
<li>Dashboarding, UAT planning, and action trackers will reside centrally (=
Honeywell), but copies may be shared with other teams (e.g., Capital Edge).=
</li>

nance that will be tested in August, but most of the finance will be tested=
 in probably September and October. But that&#39;s what we need to talk to =
them about. Because if there&#39;s an action item that says finance, we nee=
d to update the calendars for uat, for their UAT in September, October, we =
should talk to it. He would like to talk about entry exit criteria because =
his POCs would likely work with the service owners. So Harry&#39;s POCs to =
define this. He&#39;s big on test scripts, so particularly on test scenario=
s, one of the things that we need to look at is they have developed test sc=
enarios. It&#39;s likely that they will share those test scenarios and they=
 will want to understand from Harry and the team, or even the ERP team, whe=

 that they&#39;re going to share that with ISC next week, mid next week is =
what I heard, that ERP test scripts run the gamut of all the functions, sup=
ply chain, finance, etc. So if finance has defined test scenarios, then tho=
se test scenarios need to be aligned with these IT functions to translate t=

ickly align with finance to understand whether their test scripts match or =
reflect the scenarios these guys have developed. So if I have 100 scenarios=
, and I need 300 test scripts against those scenarios for these seven syste=
ms that they use, or nine systems whatever is in their Excel or in their Po=
werPoint, then I need to know, okay, I&#39;ve got 300 test scripts, ERP, wh=
at have you done? If you&#39;ve developed test scripts, do those line up to=
 the 300? I need how many of them match, how many of them you need to devel=
op, how many of them you need to redo. So the conversation in bringing that=
 is to align both of them and say, can you do a follow up call or here&#39;=
s a test script, or here&#39;s the test scenarios rather, erp, you need to =
tell us if these line up with the test scripts.</div></div><div style=3D"ma=

 so filter through the 82 and see which functions they are and then we have=
 the names of the work stream leads for each function. So it&#39;s you know=
, it&#39;s Harry for IT Finance, Harry Tong. You saw SRI that the Bill Pons=
etti is the PM there. But you know Srinivas is Sri&#39;s perhaps right hand=
 person to support the engagement. So SRI or Srinivas can answer ERP and th=
en you&#39;ve got Steven Brown to answer all of ccex. And then we probably =
have a couple of others. Some of these others IT for IT applications like M=
365 and Da Da da. You know so those we can also get Rashid to see who the o=
wners are because he&#39;s dealing with some of those IT for IT application=
s like sso and some of those if you look at the filter for the 82, some of =
them are it for it. They&#39;re not business apps, they&#39;re like M365 Sh=
arePoint. So we may be able to get names from ratio that pre populates and =
then go into these calls as well. Okay, so I would suggest where we can we =
pre populate some names et cetera. But if not then maybe we do this. So we =
have some time Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So tomorrow afternoon 1:30 East=
ern I&#39;m free. Thursday afternoon 2 Eastern I&#39;m free. Actually 2 Eas=
tern each day. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is free. So maybe we book an hou=
