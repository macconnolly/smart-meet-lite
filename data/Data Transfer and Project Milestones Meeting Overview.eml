Transcript:
0:00
You are now connected.

0:01
You can merge your calls when ready.

0:07
Don't want anything leaking to =
Safran before we close. So curious on if you had any feelings towards kind =
of those major milestones.

0:21
Yeah, I mean, you brought up a good point.=
 Yeah, you bring up a good point. Like, we've been told to, like, you know,=
 get things done as quickly as we can so we're not, you know, held up on =
day one. And ideally, this information that they already have access to now=
 and information they already have that's going to be going with the sale. =
So I'm assuming that, like, when we segregate, like, they should only have =
what they need anyways. Right. So I think he just joined. I'm not sure if =
you want to repeat that and see if he has an opinion.

0:54
Right. No. And I think. I think, you know, I'm mostly aligned with you, =
Rachel. Hey, Anthony, can you hear us?

1:01
Hey, guys, how you doing?

1:03
Question was just around, is there a mandate or guiding principle on =
how data is being transferred to Saffron?

1:11
Right.

1:12
I mean, we've got cutover as the end of May, but, you know, we plan to have=
 the copies created at the beginning of May, and of course we'll go through=
 testing and things like that, but is there any date we should be backing =
into, you know, which would then say, hey, maybe we need to speed up =
creating the copies or is close the right time frame to be cutting over?

1:40
So just one clarification. Transferring data to actuation or =
transferring it to Saffron.

1:48
I'm using those interchangeably.

1:50
Okay.

1:51
So correct me if I'm. If I'm wrong there, but I mean, and that =
was the risk I was. We were just talking about. Right. So we don't want to =
share anything that might inadvertently go to Saffron before official close=
. Although potentially we could finish before then and do that before then.=
 Right. Especially if it's redacted. So I was just curious if you had an =
opinion or knowledge there.

2:15
So. So yeah, So I wouldn't use Saffron =
and actuation interchangeably. Just a couple. Like one reason why, =
essentially, is if we're giving Saffron, essentially has no rights. Like =
they shouldn't be getting. Let me take a step back. If we're disentangling =
pre day one, then we can do it pre day one. The only time we need to give =
something to actuation is if they request it specifically via the data site=
 or we're giving it to them as a data extract disposition on day one. And I=
 hope I didn't lose you with some of the terminology there. But for =
Polarium, we don't need to give anything to Saffron for day one.

3:02
Because Nick, at least I'm understanding their IDs won't be changing on day=
 one. So they'll still have access through what they do now. They'll just =
be going through their new copy of the project rather than the project that=
 they use now. Right, Anthony?

3:18
Yeah. So maybe like we should probably=
 talk about an example just so that I'm tracking. I may not be =
understanding it properly. So.

3:29
I think that's.

3:30
Which line item are you referring to? Sorry?

3:33
You highlighted on 23 =
and 24, but then there's also 33 and 34, which are. So creating the copies =
and then sharing the copies.

3:44
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. So this is going =
to actuation. It's not going to suffer as the buyer. And so the question is=
 when do we do this or.

3:56
Correct. So we've got sharing the copies at =
the end of May. Should we try to expedite that? Right. Because. Right. Our =
activity right now is to go through these start and end dates and to =
optimize this. And so we have an opportunity to optimize those dates of =
sharing the copies. Should it be earlier or not?

4:18
So I think one thing we may need to do here. Right. Is and let's just agree=
 on the strategy is I think and this session specifically around a work =
plan. Is that fair?

4:31
This is. This meeting is about the work plan =
dates.

4:34
Yes. Okay, cool, cool. All right.

4:36
So when we have share a copy, I think it's create a copy on like the =
existing instance. Right. That they have rights to. Like, I think that =
that's where we're getting lost or confused here is like in this copy =
terminology and we're not sure we're not sharing a copy. It's like you're =
creating a copy that they will continue to have access to on day one. So =
like the business process is not interrupted. Right.

5:07
Yeah, I think for. I think from my standpoint. Can you put row 11 in like a=
 bright font for a sec?

5:20
Just like gray.

5:23
Just. Yeah. Red font. Like just a. Sorry. Just a way to really distinguish =
it because this is milestone one. Right. So we're saying.

5:30
But also, Anthony, I got challenged by Jen that this is really not =
something we need to have because she directed me to just CCV on all of our=
 communications of people like Adam and our respective Collins counterpart.=
 And that is her awareness not getting a scope signed off. So she =
challenged this item, this line item.

5:55
Okay, but then what happens =
when we're missing 20 projects on day one. I understand what she's coming =
from and maybe it's the verbiage that may have upset her. Rachel. Maybe =
it's just like actuation, validation or something. A sign off may seem like=
. Was it the word sign off or was it actuation? Shouldn't be involved in =
what actuation business has.

6:20
She was saying that the app owners are =
the ones that need to be okay with the changes, not Stevie. So she should =
just be brought in as awareness.

6:30
Yeah. So I guess I would politely =
disagree with that because we don't know what we're. So this is where Jinha=
 Maryann always says we need the business to validate the data for SAP. =
Like we need the business to validate the data. Otherwise whatever we're =
doing, I guess I'm trying to understand where she's coming from. If it's =
like we don't need them to sign off, then that's probably fair. Right? We =
probably just need to have them engaged. But if it's like we don't need to =
involve actuation on what data they use for their business, then I. We =
would just be doing complete guesswork. So do you know which angle it was? =
Sorry, Nick.

7:22
No, I didn't mean to jump in. I, I me hearing you walk =
through that. I think it was the signed off. I mean, I, I would politely =
agree with Anthony Rachel that somebody from the business needs to validate=
. And validate is probably a better word than signed off. And then scope =
might also be a word that, that spooked her a little bit. So.

7:49
Because she said that like Adam giving the sign off is what we need, not =
Stevie. Because Stevie's not gonna, she's not in the tools. She won't know.=
 Oh, so she just needs awareness. Like every time, like we're working with =
our Adam and whoever Colin's counterpart ends up being that Stevie should =
be cc'd on what the agreement is coming to. But she advised that the app =
owners, the people engaged and are tied off while CC Stevie in those emails=
 and discussions.

8:24
So I wasn't thinking of Stevie at all in this row. =
This is to me is Atwell. This to me is Adam.

8:34
So Adam's considered the=
 business lead.

8:36
Yeah. For Rockford. That's what Andy Ragg has said in=
 his thing. Adam and Prashant kb.

8:43
Okay. Because I guess I got thrown =
off when I saw this term. Not Adam C like these other line items. So if =
he's already.

8:50
I could see why that's the case. Right. So. So I didn't=
. Yeah, yeah.

8:56
Line Eight. That's what Adam's doing.

8:58
I thought so.

8:59
Rachel, that's like, you're like. That's you on the =
owner for that one, right? Like I. We've already got the answer for that =
one. Like we know who the stakeholders are. It's Adam because he sent those=
 names through. I thought already.

9:16
Adam sent what? Sorry about that.

9:18
So Andy Rag has already sent. Like this has already been done. Andy's =
already said who's the right people?

9:24
There were like two people he =
mentioned.

9:26
Right. So yes, let's. Let's bring this back up just one =
level for a sec. Regardless of what row 11 says, this is we're done with =
the scoping kind of thing. We can agree on terminology later, I think, but =
we're saying next. What day today? Next Thursday. We are fully locked into =
what projects dedicated to actuation, dedicated to columns, common or =
entangled. Is that feasible for Rockford?

10:06
I think that's an Adam =
question.

10:09
Well, I just thinking like from what we've seen. Right. So=
 how many projects are at Rockford? Total.

10:18
Rockford. Total projects.=
 Give me one.

10:25
Because I guess what I'm just trying to do is to make =
it easier for Rachel to speak to this plan. We say finalize scope. We say =
prototyping complete. We say execution. Well, we'll get to that in a sec, =
but I think it's going to be much and I'm sorry, Rachel, I had to drop from=
 the update that you gave this morning, but. Well, that's not the actuation=
 ones. Mac, how many did we share with Prashant and Adam to review? 6.

11:02
It was 68 and 11, so. 78.

11:06
That's right.

11:07
Those have been shared with them. I'm sorry, have those been shaved, like =
shared with them yet?

11:13
Yeah, I had just done it directly before we =
chatted yesterday and you got me in the team site and then I think Nick =
sent you the template that we can put into the team site and load for them =
to enter their data into live. But they have the underlying data to have =
those conversations. And then the ask is here's the template in the team =
site. Please fill it out live.

11:42
Yeah, I have the template. I just =
want to make sure they have what they need to have a productive =
conversation tomorrow, you know.

11:48
Yeah, I was pinging with them =
earlier. I think that they do let me follow up with Prashant and make sure =
that he's been able to make some progress. But either way I think that we =
have to keep our foot on the gas and have a conversation with them and make=
 sure that it's making sense. We can also talk about the test of that =
internal app and start to gather that information from them too. So if =
they're not prepared to have the full review, we can get that from them as =
well. What project should we test with that's entangled so Bruce can make =
that copy which we. That's what we talked about this morning, I think.

12:27
Okay, so just a couple of housekeeping items, I think. Rachel, do you=
 mind creating like I don't love the. The side chats and because like we're=
 all going to get poured into a different call at a different time. Right. =
Rachel's going to get summoned by Jason or just being able to give an =
update. So I think what might help Rachel, if you're okay with this, is =
this a creative Polarian working team chat or something? Because I just =
like Mac, I appreciate you reaching out and hustling. I just worry that =
that's not making it back to Nick or myself or Rachel or Todd and it just. =
Because that's the thing. Right. We're trying to hand this back to the DT =
team. We need to make sure that they've got all the context that you have. =
So anyway, I think row 11 is next Friday. We have to have the scope locked =
down. Right. And then prototyping. Well, this is for Rockford. Is this the.=
 Do we have this duplicated for Bangalore?

13:35
Not yet.

13:36
Not yet.

13:37
Okay, so Bangalore is a bit ahead, but I think actuation scope signed=
 off. So I think we need to have this done. We need to put the pressure on.=
 So we're saying obtain a list of Polarian projects. Max done that =
disposition. Polarian projects is. That's like a draft, but yes. Identify =
actuation users. Max on that alarm. Actuation users to actuation projects. =
Oh, that's the mapping. Interview aligned actuation users to validate =
actuation. Interview aligned actuation users to validate actuations.

14:20
Yeah. So this one was the one where he said he had to go and talk to. =
Because there's that one person who's on like, you know, 30 a bit entangled=
. He has to go speak to that person.

14:36
Okay. So I would put validate =
actuation. Like where is it? Interview. I would put validate actuation use.=
 Well, like validate like actuation scope.

14:56
Yeah, like the. Like =
whoever's name is on that project was how it was determined to be =
actuations and Adam doesn't know. It's that person who has to confirm. So =
Adam has to go ask that person, is this reality or is this some crap that's=
 10 years old and never happened, that kind of thing.

15:14
Yeah, but it's still Adam's a choke point. So I would put validate =
actuation project dispositions as that row. And then we're saying 3:14 so =
saying he's going to have all that done tomorrow.

15:33
It's not. Yeah, there's it. I don't think like based on those folks, I =
don't think that they are 100% the right people. Prashant was willing I =
think by the end to take more ownership of going and facilitating those =
conversations. But it depends who we're putting this in front of. I don't =
want to set ourselves up to be running red if we don't want to be. But I =
don't think that they're going to have it fully validated by tomorrow.

16:04
Yeah. And that's where those yellows come in. Antony.

16:07
Okay, so let's be realistic.

16:09
Yellow.

16:09
Yeah. So I think it's a =
line actuation uses the projects. I would just put. So let's give ourselves=
 a tick here. Right. Just put onboard actuation stakeholders for this one.

16:24
Okay.

16:26
And this is onboard actuation stakeholders. And I just =
realized this is out of order now because number eight says identify who =
they are. But. And then. So we can do that as yesterday and mark it =
complete. Nick.

16:44
So do you want me to delete this line item, Anthony?

16:47
Yeah, we can. Sorry, I didn't realise you were driving.

16:52
And I think the align on row five can just be. The word can be changed to =
Mac instead of a line.

16:58
So a line actuation.

17:01
Mapped. So. So that's complete mactive though.

17:07
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's fine. And then identify columns, identify =
actuation. And the next one is I would just put actuation to validate. I =
would just put here. What's that? Identify plarium project with links =
outside project. That's a different thing. Or to get. Well hold off on that=
 one because that one's an output of dispositioning. That's more in =
execution to be honest. So for this Rockford discovery, just put actuation =
to validate project dispositions. And when do we want Adam and Prashant to =
have that done by.

17:55
Tuesday.

17:56
That's running through the 678. =
You said Mac and saying yes actuation no kind of thing.

18:04
Yeah, it's got to be before. It's got to be for this one. Right. So Bruce =
can do the copies.

18:11
Well, Bruce can start. Well technically, yeah, =
Bruce can start with some of that stuff now. But yeah, I think we need to =
make this like Tuesday.

18:22
Rachel.

18:22
That is feasible.

18:25
I think Tuesday Is feasible. Yeah, Tuesday is realistic.

18:29
And so I think that what. Because what we want to do, team, is once we get =
this buttoned up, cleaned up, we send it to Adam and Prashant. Okay, guys, =
you're on the hook. Like actuation to validate project dispositions. =
Identify Polarian project with links outside project. What does that mean? =
Is that the bri. Is that the Bruce issue, where they're.

18:53
Like multiple projects for one. You want to go ahead Mac, but yeah, that's =
what it is, I think.

19:00
Sorry, go ahead.

19:02
No, I mean, I was just going to probably say the same thing. So this is =
where there are multiple projects linked to the same work item, I think. Or=
. Or there's some complexity there where it's not just one project. And so =
Bruce has to see if he can properly copy that. And then the project shows =
the right. The copy shows the right links to other projects in the copy.

19:29
Yeah, it's like linking outside of the project because like if a work=
 item for a document links to, there's a link in it to another project. =
Like there were two examples this morning that were interlinked. Will it =
point to the new copied version of the other project? We know that it can =
do it for itself. Like if it is self referencing, but externally =
referencing, I think he has to make sure that that automation works.

20:00
So I don't want to conflate that with like, I almost think for initiative =
for here I would maybe just call this phase. And I hate to do this and you =
guys can tell me no, but I don't want to put detailed disentanglement stuff=
 into the discovery section. Like we need to clear base level discovery.

20:19
Agreed.

20:20
And I see that, like what, I see what you're talking =
about now is being done at the project level.

20:27
I think, up here. And it doesn't have to be in discovery, but because he =
should be able to do that tomorrow. Right. He just has to find one. And so,=
 you know, we can hand it to Bruce and Bruce can do that before he has to =
or while he's doing his current testing before he has to test kind of the =
full moxie. So I think prototyping works, but he can definitely do that =
sooner rather than later.

20:54
Is this identifying one project?

20:58
Right.

20:58
We just need an example.

21:01
Yeah, I would put that into =
prototyping. It also doesn't say that here. It says like what? Like, oh, =
okay, plarium project. So this is. Yes, I think that's the. That's the =
second line item in. In prototyping. Right. To get that going.

21:21
Which line are you Describing.

21:23
So if you insert a row above 13.

21:25
Okay.

21:31
And then put. And then copy row, row nine in there and =
just put like identify a single and we just want one or multiple.

21:47
Bruce has asked for one. All right, Maybe.

21:52
Does Adam know he has to =
do this? I thought we just discussed this with Bengalore.

21:58
Adam probably does not know he needs to do this. I have not. Can you do =
that to him again? I think we were going to plan and communicate that with =
him during tomorrow's meeting. We could probably try to send him something =
ahead of time with all of our asks of him and Prashant.

22:26
Okay. So I think discovery actuation to validate project dispositions. I =
would just put. For row 10, you've got there. I would just put columns. To =
perform final validation. To perform final validation of dispositions. Yeah=
. So if he gets that done on Tuesday, we give say two days. That's 220. So =
that's a week from today. So that's 320 where Collins is. Collins is going =
to say yes. These 68 projects should be this way. So that's 320. Okay. And =
that's gonna. That needs to be Nate Gove. Nate G.

23:20
And you want this to change to the 20th?

23:22
No, it's. Well, you're only=
 giving them a day. Yeah, if we can.

23:30
And then delete line 10.

23:32
Yeah, that's the one that upset Jen and I could see why. It's a pretty =
strongly worded item. All right, so we're saying we're done with. We know =
our scope by next Thursday, which is longer than Jason's out. Which. Which =
is good. Not good. Well, yeah, it's good. And the draft is. Yeah, so Nate's=
 done. So. Not Nate. Bruce has done the. The Polarian project copy approach=
. Identify Valerian project with links outside project. That's Adam. Manual=
 identification of work items to inform copies. What's that mean? Is this =
for the prototype or is this for everything?

24:19
This is the whole thing. So this is. Adam has to go through and say which =
work items do not need to be copied over.

24:27
So that's not prototyping.=
 I would say that's like execution or like it's. Yeah, I would almost say =
that's requiring requirements gathering or something. Because we're not =
going to do all that in prototype. Like my envision of prototyping is do =
two quick projects, get us in the clear, and then we know we've got a path =
forward to punch on with.

24:53
Yeah, I think execution makes a lot of =
sense for that one.

24:58
Do we want to split it? Because it's going to be=
 the only thing that. Like that. I. This is where we're going to have to =
split it out a bit. I. Because I think we only need to do that for projects=
 that are common. Well, no, sorry, we only need to do that for comment for =
projects that are entangled, which is six projects in India know this is =
Rockford, but you.

25:28
Know what I'm saying, like agreed, exactly.

25:34
Of entangled work items.

25:37
Well, I think what we want to say is =
execution. Is this going into cap edge?

25:44
It will eventually. Yeah.

25:46
Okay, so I think with execution we want to have execution Rockford. =
Common. Sorry, I'm using their terms now. Execution Rockford. And then it's=
 going to be dedicated columns. Dedicated. Like it's going to break it into=
 our disposition type. So there'll be kind of four subsections for each =
site. I'll take a pause there to see if that makes sense.

26:14
So you're saying dedicated.

26:17
They need to be their own line. Right. =
Well, so it's like menu identification of work items is only for entangled =
projects. So I guess what I'm trying to say is we have execution and then =
in like execution we'll have actuation dedicated. And then it's identify =
Collins users who have access to tool. Remove Collins users who have access=
 to project. And then the next one is identify Collins projects. Identify =
actuation users. Remove actuation users. And I've got to jump. Do you mind =
pinging me the link to this one, Rachel? I might be able to make some quick=
 edits just on structure and maybe.

27:11
Tomorrow morning or afternoon =
might be best to review. We have our standing tag up so we can do that, but=
 that we also have our call with Adam at that same time. So I can move our =
standing session to a different time if we want Both.

27:27
So what times do we have? Did you say? Sorry.

27:31
We're talking to Adam & Co. At 11:30 Eastern, which is during our regular =
tag up huddle. But I can move that tag up huddle to another time slot if we=
 want to keep it.

27:48
I'm actually surprisingly free tomorrow morning =
and.

27:51
I don't know why that's scary.

27:56
Yeah. Oh, I accepted. =
Someone's out of office.

28:00
You did? I thought you were out this =
afternoon.

28:04
Yeah, people send out of offices and when you accept them=
, they don't. You've got to. Anyway, I'm free like honestly for like the =
hour and a half before then, Rachel. So I'm Whenever, like whenever you =
want to do it. I'm good.

28:18
Okay. I move it the half hour before =
because I'm pretty booked until 11, so I'm gonna move it to 10:30 Central, =
11 Eastern. That sound good?

28:31
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cool. All =
righty. Thank you, guys.

28:40
Thank you so much.

28:41
And you have.
