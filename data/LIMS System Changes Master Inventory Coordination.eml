Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 13, 2025Attendees

   - Jason, Brian, Steve, Steven, Paul, Chase, Bill, Gary, James, Phil,
   David, Sriram, Rakesh, Jaime, Mac, others mentioned.
   - Partial drop-ins/out: Chase delegated representation to Jason and
   Brian.

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Status and Dependencies for LIMS and Critical
Application Interfaces

   -

   *LIMS Team Progress:*
   - Awaiting green light from LIMS team; expected mid-June to finalize
      system bifurcation.
      - LIMS is critical for ISC (Integrated Supply Chain), with 8 active
      ISC LIMS applications and 17 identified in ecosystem.
      - LIMS changes: Moving from on-prem to a new environment (specified
      as =E2=80=9Cthe Colo,=E2=80=9D not the cloud), impacting certain inte=
rface pathways.
   -

   *Impact on Operations:*
   - ISC consumes 80=E2=80=9390% of IT systems, so changes in critical apps=
 (LIMS,
      Ecosystem, Packout, SAP interfaces) have broad impact.
      - Key question and repeated concern: How will changes to software,
      interfaces, and server environments affect daily operations,
especially for
      LIMS?
   -

   *UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Requirements:*
   - Discussion on testing scope: Should focus only on connections where
      infrastructure is changing, not full end-to-end validation unless ser=
vers
      or paths change.
      - Applications like Quality Optimizer and Packout highlighted=E2=80=
=94require
      clarification on what needs to be validated.

2. Inventory and Ownership of Critical Applications

   -

   *List Management:*
   - Multiple lists exist=E2=80=94need to reconcile into a single master li=
st for
      system ownership tracking and UAT planning.
      - Gaps found: Some applications discussed (e.g., Packout,
      ProcessView, NWA, Quality Optimizer, Ballistics Database) were
missing from
      some versions of the critical system lists.
   -

   *Roles & Responsibilities:*
   - Each application/system should have:
         - An IT owner
         - A business/plant/site owner
      - Testing requirements may be plant-specific due to differences in
      LIMS deployments and interfaces (example: requirements for Spokane vs=
.
      other sites).
   -

   *Complexity Across Sites:*
   - Each site may use different LIMS products: LabVantage, Nexus, RQMS,
      Ballistics Database, etc.
      - Noted that just listing "LIMS" is insufficient; each specific type
      and deployment must be itemized.
   -

   *File Management:*
   - Need to confirm which list is the authoritative source (=E2=80=9CSyste=
ms
      Template ise=E2=80=9D), ensure all work and updates are consolidated,=
 and avoid
      working off multiple, divergent files.

3. Communication and Clarity of Changes

   -

   *What's Changing vs. Not Changing:*
   - Emphasis that understanding what is *not* changing is just as
      important as clarifying what is changing.
      - Many confusion points stem from lack of communication about benign
      migrations vs. fundamental system or interface alterations.
   -

   *Testing Guidance:*
   - Service owners must specify, for each application/line item:
         - What is changing.
         - What is not changing.
         - Resulting impact on UAT (e.g., connection test only, login
         validation, or no action).
      -

   *Need for Clear Messaging:*
   - There are mixed messages from different groups; must standardize on
      clear and concise communication to all stakeholders via service owner=
s.

4. UAT Planning and Coordination

   -

   *Cross-functional Involvement:*
   - UAT must account for applications falling under multiple
      functions=E2=80=94engineering, supply chain, HSE, and site/business-m=
anaged
      applications.
      - Need to synchronize test planning and point-of-contact
      identification across all these domains.
   -

   *Timeline & Upcoming Milestones:*
   - LIMS upgrade/enhancement was supposed to be finished by Monday (June
      9).
      - Goal is to =E2=80=9Cclone=E2=80=9D environments such that from the =
user
      perspective, nothing changes (data, workflows remain consistent).
      - Target for sharing the consolidated list and validating what's
      changing: Next Monday or Tuesday (June 16 or 17).
   -

   *Testing Methods:*
   - For server name/path changes: Point external applications (e.g.,
      Packout) to new locations and verify data flows.
      - For interface-only changes: Only connections testing required.
      - No need for complete functional validation for applications not
      fundamentally changed.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Inventory Validation and Completion*
   - Jason, Brian to provide and review the incomplete systems list;
      identify missing applications, reconcile with Steven's earlier
master list.
      - Deadline for updated list: June 16=E2=80=9317, 2025.
   2.

   *Clarified Change Documentation*
   - Service owners to document for every application:
         - What is changing
         - What is not changing
         - Nature of required UAT (e.g., connection, login, full process)
      - Bill, Gary, James, Phil, and respective towers will coordinate this
      communication.
   3.

   *Master Inventory Reconciliation*
   - Steven to locate the original manufacturing critical systems list and
      share.
      - Team to integrate this =E2=80=9Clong list=E2=80=9D with current bus=
iness readiness
      validation files.
   4.

   *Develop Testing Guidelines*
   - Guidance to be created at the application owner level detailing what
      kind of testing is needed per change scope.
      - Slides/guidelines to clarify required activities for all IT and
      business owners involved.
   5.

   *Consolidated UAT Contact List*
   - Rakesh to coordinate and gather identified testers (from both business
      and IT side) for each site/application.
   6.

   *Follow-up and Knowledge Sharing*
   - Plan knowledge sharing session focused on =E2=80=9Cwhat=E2=80=99s chan=
ging/what=E2=80=99s not=E2=80=9D
      application-by-application.
      - Schedule further review and alignment meeting(s), potentially with
      =E2=80=9Coffice hours=E2=80=9D for key sites.
      - Sriram to coordinate with Gary and others to set up the next
      discussion.
   7.

   *File/Document Management*
   - Confirm and communicate the single source of truth file; ensure it is
      updated and housed in the correct directory for all stakeholders.
   8.

   *Clear Messaging to IT Towers*
   - Rakesh to ensure all service owners understand the expectation to
      confirm and document UAT requirements for every system involved=E2=80=
=94no blanks
      allowed.

------------------------------
Follow-up Points & Next Steps

   - *Validate the manufacturing side's questions are fully addressed; fill
   gaps in application/system coverage.*
   - *Ensure every site and function is cross-mapped with relevant
   applications for UAT planning.*
   - *Next reconciliation and planning session scheduled for week of June
   16, 2025.*
   - *Pending: Shared access to updated =E2=80=9Cmaster inventory=E2=80=9D =
and consolidated
   points-of-contact lists.*
   - *Encourage feedback and suggestion of missing systems/applications
   from all team members.*
   - *Action item to set up application-by-application review sessions as
   needed.*
   - *Require explicit service owner sign-off on what level of UAT (if any)
   is required for each system.*

------------------------------
Decisions & Conclusions

   - The process must move from ad hoc, application-specific tracking to a
   comprehensive, reconciled, and clearly owned master list.
   - Broad communication must be established not only about what is
   changing, but particularly about what is *not* changing, to reduce
   unnecessary effort and confusion during UAT.
   - Ownership and lines of accountability need ongoing clarification at
   both IT and site/business levels, especially due to the variety of LIMS =
and
   interfacing applications in use.
   - Action plan and deadlines are in place to support timely UAT
   preparation and minimize operational risk.

------------------------------

*End of Summary.*
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Stephen0:00
But we're waiting on that LIMS team to give us the green light sometime
pretty soon. It's supposed to be mid month that we can make that
bifurcation and go.
Brian0:10
But why isn't pack out on the list? I think is part of the question.
Chase0:15
And lims, I mean our LIMS is.
Jason0:18
So why don't we do this, Jason, Brian, we will send you this list knowing
that it's incomplete. We will send you the inventory and we'll work with,
you know, work with you to get that full list. Whatever you think is
missing, add that in here, we'll go back and validate it. That Steve and
Steven.
Jaime0:38
No, we've already, I think we're missing. Let's talk about how ISC
operates. So we're taking sales orders, we manufacture a bunch of goods, we
touch probably 90% of the IT systems. I'm guessing we are large consumers
of most of our software. I don't know Paul, maybe my 90%'s off, maybe it's
80. So all these questions around all these other softwares that are
changing or not changing, how are we going to be impacted by that? That
makes sense. So lims. LIMS is on the list. I think it's on the R D list.
However, we are heavy consumers of that.
Brian1:27
It's on the engineering list.
Jaime1:29
Yeah, yeah, but it's a critical, but.
Chase1:33
It'S a critical app in order to do uat.
Brian1:35
Yeah, understood.
Jaime1:38
Yeah. So we, you know, when this journey started a long time ago, IC
provided a list of what we thought were critical applications that we use
that is already created. We've, we've got that, that was then reconciled
and divided amongst all the various functions. And so those are the
questions. That's where they're coming is, what is the plan for those? How
do we know LIMS is going to work?
Stephen2:10
Those are the two long tail ones for me, Stephen, is LIMS and Ecosystem
those interfaces. Because it's not something that I can control, but it's
something that I need to provide. There's 17 that we've identified in
ecosystem, environment and eight active ones for ISC in LIMS. Once they're
done with this upgrade enhancement that they're working on, which was
supposed to be done by Monday, you know, mid June, then what we're going to
do is clone and ensure that only traffic going over that from 81 forward
will be AM traffic for you guys and anything that was going somewhere else
will have its own interface transportation path.
Jaime2:57
Okay, and do we think that user acceptance testing is required?
Stephen3:02
I think we should definitely, you know, kick the tires on it, make sure,
you know, and try to break it. And if we can't break it, then we know we
got it. Right.
Chase3:13
You're talking about moving the lens move to the new solstice cloud.
Gary3:18
Right.
Chase3:19
You know, that's only in cix. That's in the lowest client.
Stephen3:22
Right. That's where we are right now. We're in cix. We move some stuff to
Q. But the lion's share is still an X because we're still doing a lot of
development.
Jaime3:37
And then pack out was brought up, I think. Chase, what's the SPC software?
You brought that up the other day.
Chase3:48
ProcessView and NWA.
Jaime3:50
Yeah.
Chase3:53
And I think Quality Optimizer I think is up there. Number 10. That's very
important for our shield business.
Jaime4:02
Yeah.
James4:03
As well as the ballistics database.
Chase4:07
And we had provided. Yeah, maybe these are on a different.
Jaime4:11
Yeah, so that's where a lot of these questions are coming from is all.
Jason4:17
These critical apps that we listed and Sriram. Sorry, go ahead, Chase.
James4:25
Yeah, I just wanted to say. Yeah, I actually need it to drop real quick,
but I got Brian and Jason on to talk for me. But you know, the thing for us
is almost all those applications I listed are interfacing with SAP in some
way. Some do, some do not have like quality clients or sandbox clients that
you can test in. And so the sequencing and timing of the different things
is just important to make sure you've got. You basically need an IT owner
and then like a plant owner maybe, maybe by plant because each plant's
different for each one of those on UAT is my guidance. Like what I need to
do to test lims is not necessarily what Spokane needs to do, for example.
Sriram5:06
Right.
James5:07
So just as an example, that's just one of my questions. Concerns like they
interface differently and do different things.
Brian5:16
You're on different instances and every site seems to have different LIMS
applications too.
Sriram5:21
Right.
Gary5:23
But Gary, we are not changing the servers on these limbs. Right. So
technically the interface and then the other stuff should not change in
this phase. I think that is where probably Bill, like we really need to put
a strong slide. What is changing. You don't need to test the end to end
processors in some areas, just validate the forms in some areas where the
servers are migrating. We need to do an end to end test more from a
connection standpoint of you. We don't have to validate the fields. I think
we have to push down the message to all the service owners in the IT and
make sure they Present what is changing and provide guidance to the teams
of guidelines. I think that is important. That's missing big time. And then
we are thinking very big in some areas and then very small.
Brian6:17
Right. Like BCC instant plans that Colonial Heights uses. You know, we're
moving that from the Honeywell environment just to the Colo environment.
But we're not changing anything. So all we have to do is really test it.
Sriram6:30
I'm sorry, baby.
Gary6:34
In this instance the recommendation is we want you to log in and then
perform your day to day operations. Just one and then see if works fine.
That's it. We're not asking you to validate whether the field is right.
This value is right. No, it's just simple connections testing. Right. I
think let's highlight by application owner they should be highlighting all
these things. What is changing. We are moving the servers here. So the
expectation is connection testing. Just log in and then validate. And then
here we are just valid in SAP. We're not moving the servers. No interfaces
should be changing. Just validate the forms. Right. Or we are changing the
name. I think we really need to put those slides for each, you know, from
each tower standpoint of view so the communication is clear. And then like
bring in the UAT dates like you know, quality optimizer. Like we're not
changing anything. So what are we asking? Like do we need to stick still
validate anything? Yes or no. Right. If yes, maybe just hand them a login
validation. We need to provide those guidelines. I think that's what is
confusing everybody.
Chase7:45
I think it's a little bit more involved in that. For instance, for Packout.
Packout has to know the path that it needs to talk to on the SAP side or
the LIM side.
Jaime7:59
Yeah. I think Brian, what you're missing is what's not changing.
Bill8:04
Yeah.
Jaime8:05
And you're assuming, I mean I shouldn't say you. Right. A lot of people are
assuming that we're doing a complete clone of the RP system and navigating
it to a new server. We aren't doing anything remotely close to that.
Stephen8:18
Absolutely not.
Jaime8:19
Right. That's the piece of information that we aren't telling people.
What's not changing. A lot of these things are quite benign. But the
updating a legal entity field and address.
Steven8:35
Right.
Jaime8:35
And a master list somewhere. That's the change. Yeah.
Gary8:40
Whoop.
Jaime8:40
You do?
Stephen8:41
Yeah. And for interfaces too, you know, we analyze 76, well, hundreds of
interface. We got that down to 76 that had shared pathways say going down
to CIP 300 for UOP. Those are the ones we focus on cloning, so they become
AM only interfaces. So from the AM user standpoint, nothing changes. They
log in as per usual. The data gets extracted from the server as usual, and
their work is as usual. So I guess I agree with Jaime that probably what's
not changing is more important than what is changing.
Jaime9:13
Yeah.
Chase9:16
Again, I'm going to repeat myself. I know. The LIMS system is changing and
going to a different cloud. A different cloud, right.
Brian9:24
No, the lens is not on the cloud now. Not your version of Limps. Your
version of LIMS right now is on Prem, and it will be moved on Prem and
within Honeywell, it'll be on the color because it's the ECC instance. So
we consider it. That's for control.
Chase9:41
Okay.
Brian9:42
Okay, I got.
Chase9:43
All right. We're getting a different message from a different group of
people, then I'm.
Brian9:47
Okay.
Chase9:48
Anyways, my point is, is if the server. If the server name is changing or
the path to. To lims is changing, then we have to make the change on
Packout, for example. So there is some. There's some changes that have to
be made on other applications in order to talk to SAP or LIMS or whatever.
Brian10:09
So you just got to point to the new locations.
Chase10:12
Correct. I'm just saying it's not.
Brian10:13
Yeah.
Chase10:14
Testing something. There are some minor linkages that need to be changed.
Brian10:19
Agreed. And that. That's what we're saying. We'll make those changes to
the. To the pathways and test. Make sure you're seeing the data. The data
is flowing back and forth and at that point we should be good. You're not
going to have to go out and test the entire ECC LIMS application because
we're not making changes to it. You just need to test the pathways, make
sure we're getting the data.
Chase10:44
I understood. I'm just. I was just making the point. We're just not going
to test that.
Gary10:49
We.
Chase10:50
Somebody on. On these. On these external applications may need to make some
changes in order for the connectivity to be there. That's all.
Brian10:58
Understood. Understood. We're in agreement.
Bill11:03
It sounds like there was an action to look at each of these and just
confirm, like what's changing or not changing so that we can better
understand if we have the right UAT captured. Right. Who can do that and
when can that be shared with the team.
Jason11:21
So we'll take it back to the service owners and then Gary, James, Phil will
work with you to each of these. So you've got engineering, supply chain,
hse, David. So we'll work with each of these names here on the left to get
those as quickly as we can. So I'm. Again, let's. Let's shoot for next
Monday or Tuesday to get this back to you. Okay.
Bill11:57
Yep, go ahead.
Jaime11:59
Can you go to the ISC Key Systems tab that. Yeah.
Stephen12:04
Brian, I just. I sent one last thing on lims. Brian, I just sent a note to
the two guys on my team that are managing what's changing there and ask
them to make sure they loop you in so you know what is and what isn't
changing.
Chase12:17
Okay. Yeah. Because I was just hit up this week about doing some testing
for a new Limbs client.
Jaime12:26
Like.
Chase12:26
Okay, so.
Jason12:31
All right, so. And then Bill, I think I. I guess there was a general ask.
We'll have to see Stephen, to the point of, you know, can we describe for
every system that's what is changing, what is not? Well, we'll. We'll try
and capture that. Can we go to the ISE Key systems? I think this Sriram you
gave us and we validated the list last time, so let's look at the ISE tab.
Steven12:58
Is this the same file that we're actively updating or is this a different
file? Because the file name looks different to me.
Jason13:04
Yeah, it looks different from what we talked about. True.
Steven13:07
Yeah.
Jason13:08
Okay.
Steven13:08
There is a. It was called Business Readiness Validation.
Jason13:13
Ise, correct.
Sriram13:14
Yeah, yeah, I think we just renamed.
Bill13:17
It.
Sriram13:19
But we'll check. This is the one in that same folder from the email that
was sent out with the notes. But we'll double check, and if there is
something else there, we'll incorporate that in here.
Jason13:32
Okay.
Jaime13:37
Please.
Steven13:37
I think we should work off of one file.
Jason13:39
Yeah, no, we should work off of one. We should have it in that same folder
called Systems Template ise and then move these around there.
Gary13:46
Right.
Jason13:50
So give me one second. I'm opening that folder and we'll. We'll talk
through.
Stephen13:59
There were two links, sriram, in the ping that you gave me. One didn't make
any sense to me, so I updated the other one.
Steven14:08
Okay.
Jason14:09
Gee, thanks for that pill. So we'll go check both of them and see. See
which one's which. Okay, so this. Is that what people have been updating
here?
Sriram14:18
Make it.
Steven14:19
Yeah.
Jason14:20
Correct. Okay.
Steven14:26
Well, this is. Yeah, we've got a lot of updates in this week. There's still
some more that people are working on. I thought this meeting was more on
the manufacturing side, but where do you go?
Jason14:41
Have we addressed all of the questions on the manufacturing side? I know
we're got a few more Minutes. But I think the action. Sorry, go ahead.
Jaime14:52
No, that's good.
Jason14:54
I was going to say we do have a few action items coming out of this. That.
Yes. So we do need to communicate certainly the changes and what's not
changing across. So the list that we just showed earlier, I know we added a
few things that was not on that list that you provided. So we'll go back
and add that and track to it. Is that the full list that Brian and Chase,
all of you provided a bit earlier? Going back to. If I was to stop sharing
Mac, if you can share that screen again.
Steven15:28
Steven, I think this is one thing that I know you mentioned in this call
earlier that at the beginning of this program there was a list provided for
all the manufacturing systems. Do you have that handy? Because we, in this
call we found a couple of them that was not in that tab. The manufacturing
key systems tab.
Jaime15:52
It take me a little bit to find the original. Yeah, it's a long ass list,
I'll tell you that.
Sriram15:59
That would be incredibly helpful. Right. Like if you have that list as a
starting point we can sort of bring it into and then cross align with all
of the information that we've gathered from all of these functional
alignment calls and start to be able to say for these key systems,
ultimately what we're looking for is what are the functions that need to be
involved in the testing? Right. So we have a list of systems. We can say
here's all of the folks that need to be involved and then here's all of the
points of contact which Rakesh was. The other action item was the blank
list of here's the testers from the business side or from the IT side who
need to be involved in that testing downstream. So yeah, if you could give
that list we can bring it in here and rationalize it against the modern
data.
Jason16:53
And I suspect most of them would be here. But I think if there's a few
Delta, I think we heard about Packout and LIMS and a couple of others.
Brian17:02
And we got to be careful when we say limbs because we got a multitude of
different lens Systems. We got LabVantage, we got others. So we can't just
say LIMS. If you want to talk LIMS, we need to list them all out. You know,
Quality Optimizer is one that's considered lims. Ballistics Database, Lab
Vantage, all of those are lims are in the LIMS category.
Jason17:22
Then you've got Nexus LIMS as well.
Brian17:24
And Nexus as well. Yeah. And we've got more. RQMS is actually lims.
Gary17:29
I mean, I mean, shouldn't we look at the overall uat, Gary, and then like,
why don't you guys sit down and then find all the systems that our IOC
teams uses. That makes this job easy. I think we need to look at the
overall UAT timelines across all functions and then just flag.
Chase17:51
Who can I send. We had sent an email back to somebody. I can find it and I
can send you the actual, the actual application name that's in, you know,
in our IT direct system.
Jaime18:05
So you. Which that only helps us for Colonial Heights.
Chase18:09
I understand, but that, but we need to do.
Jason18:11
I mean, let's start with one site.
Steven18:14
Yeah, we're looking.
Chase18:14
We're looking out for ourselves. Right. So we're gonna. We're gonna tell
you what our. What, what the specific name is of, of the limbs, quote,
unquote limbs that Gary's talking about. But it seems like you got some
items on the R D list and some on this ISC list and they're.
Jaime18:33
All over because we touched most here.
Chase18:37
Is there a chance that we could asterisk a few of them so that the R and D
ones are in the ua, are in the icuat bucket so that we can. You know.
Jaime18:48
I like Heimera's idea. Right. Isn't there a master list of all the UATs?
And then we cross reference what we're interested in?
James19:00
I think that's.
Gary19:01
Otherwise we're gonna keep missing something. Steve.
Jaime19:04
Like, I know like chasing Colonial Heights is like, okay, that's one out of=
.
Chase19:08
16.
Jaime19:10
And probably one out of 16 applications for Colonial Heights. It doesn't
get us anywhere. We'll still be talking about this in December.
Jason19:17
Yeah, yeah. So what we can do is. And Gary will work with you on it, but
yeah, And James, we have the master inventory. We can. And Jaime will. Will
take that and perhaps, you know, have the follow up session here to go
through that master inventory and go through. You know, I think there are
site level applications there and other functions across all functions.
Take a look at that and align. Now again, it may be you have to be site by
site or we could do some office hours with get several sites on the Brian
yourself and a few others to just talk through that list.
Brian19:56
And Rakesh, I think you're gonna see that these applications fall under
Engineering isc. They fall under business managed all over.
Jason20:03
Right, Right, they are. That's the challenges. Yeah. Yeah. So Gary, maybe
the action item is for us to take and see how best we can package that,
because you're right in that A lot of them, they are across all over. So
again, I'm just thinking out loud, but again we won't solve it here, but
let's take an action item then Stephen to. We'll take an action item to
work with Gary to get that initial list and then we'll set up a follow up
call with you, Brian and others as needed. Sriram, I'll work it through you
to set up the conversations next week to get that discussion going.
Gary20:47
Let's do it.
Jason20:49
Okay. All right, so quite a few action items, so I think nothing, you know,
again more work for us to get to the bottom of this. And then I think the
action item, certainly the list of test names for Bill to send. And then
we'll plan a knowledge sharing session with what's changing and then
certainly here, you know, by app a follow up session to identify what is
changing and what is the scope of testing so that we can track it in one
place here. All right, any other questions, comments from the team? I think
it was a good conversation but a lot more activities to get done here. So.
Gary21:36
Yeah, Rakesh, just make sure the messaging is clear to all the IT towers
that, you know, I mean everybody should have a plan for uat, yes or no.
There should not be any blank lefts. The service owners have to acknowledge
is there any UAT required or not. And then like, you know, let's have them
like list out what is changing, what is not changing and then like that
gives us a clear list and then we can clearly mark which ones belongs to
IAC and then bring in that list to the team. But the messaging needs to be
clear to the service owners. They need to flag each and every line item
relevant for UAT and then the respective information because that scope of.
Jason22:22
The changes will dictate what consists of UAT to the to what level. Right,
point noted. So we'll take that back to the IT owners and all of the
service, the work stream leads and send that get that message out. So.
Jaime22:43
Okay, thanks for translating.
Jason22:44
Thanks, appreciate it.
Jaime22:48
Yeah, take care.
Brian22:49
Thanks everybody.
Jason22:50
Thank you.

<ul>
<li>Awaiting green light from LIMS team; expected mid-June to finalize syst=

<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Impact on Operations:</strong></p=

<ul>
<li>ISC consumes 80=E2=80=9390% of IT systems, so changes in critical apps =
(LIMS, Ecosystem, Packout, SAP interfaces) have broad impact.</li>
<li>Key question and repeated concern: How will changes to software, interf=

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Req=

<ul>
<li>Discussion on testing scope: Should focus only on connections where inf=

<li>Each site may use different LIMS products: LabVantage, Nexus, RQMS, Bal=
