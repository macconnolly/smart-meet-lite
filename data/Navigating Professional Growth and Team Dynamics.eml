### Potential Role Adjustments
- **Focus Areas**: Preference for team members to engage in areas of =
genuine interest, such as TSA execution planning and exit planning over =
costing roles.
- **Role Fit**: Execution planning and PMO-type roles deemed=
 a better fit due to existing experience, whereas costing roles are more =
specialized and less familiar.

## Career Progression

### Promotion Timeline

0:02
But most of the deals, at least that I've been a part of, =
have been very structured. So I, I ran Gap, Kimberly Clark, both of those. =
I was kind of like the senior deal tech person on and 3am that was like =
massive deal. So kind of similar to Honeywell where I was in, I was doing =
the smo but not the most senior IT deal type person, like day to day person=
 and then arc. So freeing ton of stuff over the last three years, but =
mostly kind of doing SMO IMO roles. So that's probably kind of why I'm =
playing such a broad role to be as well.

0:53
Okay. Yeah, I, I spent two =
and a half years at GE Healthcare and then the last six months at Collins =
RTX Healthcare. I was on cyber and then infrastructure and then Collins has=
 been applications. So I was on the apps work stream pretty much from its =
inception until now. It's a really quick deal for us on apps because they =
had done a lot of the pre work and went pencils down and we sort of picked =
it up and refreshed what the EY teams had already done. So less like SMO =
PMO experience, but broadly speaking. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think my.

1:56
I guess where I would say is my TSA guy is very junior, so he's like a =
first year consultant. My TSA costing guy is like a third year consultant =
and supposed to be going out for director, but I don't think that's gonna =
happen based on kind of what I've seen thus far. Yeah, so like what where =
Will's always gonna say like program needs first, you know, like our team =
needs and then personal needs. But my, my thing is like I always want to =
get people experience on something that they're actually interested in. So =
I don't know if you're super interested in TSAs like execution planning and=
 exit planning kind of TSA exit planning and then the execution piece of =
that or if you're interested in costing. So I would say the rub with =
costing is, you know you're, you would be picking up someone else's model =
if that's what you were doing.

3:06
Yeah, I have less experience with =
costing. I think day one execution planning and then the actual execution =
of it is probably going to be the best fit. Like more of a PMO type role =
like costing in tsa I feel like is something very specific that I don't =
have a lot of exposure to. So it depends what type of level of experience =
you're looking for there. And I think that like I would love to learn it, =
but it would Be just that it would be learning it rather than like bringing=
 experience doing it. Like, my exposure has been like, really later in the =
life cycle after costing has been done. The TSAs have been written. Other =
than like one very small deal at the beginning of my career where I worked =
on costing, it hasn't been like TSA or costing centric. So I. I think that =
it just depends what you're looking for, you know?

4:19
Yeah. If it. To your point, like, I didn't know how much costing and stuff =
you did at kpmg. Yeah. With like Jonathan and Kevin and those guys. So if =
it's not a lot, it probably would probably be a better fit for like, TSA =
exit planning and some of those.

4:35
Yes, I completely agree with you.

4:38
Okay. All right. I will let Will know. Probably. I think that makes =
more sense from a program perspective too, because even. Even if I did want=
 to move someone out of the costume role, I think it would be too =
disruptive.

4:55
Yeah.

4:56
At this point.

4:58
Yeah. That. I mean, =
that's what Will was saying was sort of that it's like he was thinking =
about shifting people around and doing some movement. But I think =
ultimately, like, the. It's a balance, Right. Of what is going to be =
disruptive and what is going to have like the most positive net impact on =
the program. And then like, personal needs come after that, obviously. So =
let me know what Will says. Are there, like. Is there a role at Honeywell =
that is unfilled for like, a consultant in like, any of those other areas, =
like the day one execution planning or like, you also mentioned inventory =
change control, too.

5:47
I've got a guy for that and I don't want to move=
 him out of it because it's more. He's like automated all of the =
spreadsheets and stuff, so he'll know how to do that.

5:55
That's awesome. That's the type of guy you keep around. For sure.

6:00
Yeah. I don't want 100. Yeah. I don't want to try to figure out any of that=
 stuff.

6:08
Yeah, it's the worst. Capital Edge is the worst.

6:14
It is the worst. I agree with you on that.

6:18
Yeah.

6:19
So, yeah, nothing that's on film, I think. I don't know that we would =
necessarily move anyone off that we have. Yeah, I think it would probably =
be a good fit for exit planning and like, helping out with like, some of =
the PMO stuff too.

6:38
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I completely agree with =
you.

6:41
It'd be good for you too, because then you get like, you get =
more broad exposure to all of the work streams. So I Think that could be =
good for you as well?

6:51
Yeah, I think that that would be good.

6:54
And then what? Are you up for director or are you like.

6:58
No. So I'm a consultant. I was promoted at mid year last year so I won't go=
 up for director at least until December, probably not until next summer so=
 I can get back on cycle.

7:14
Okay, makes sense.

7:16
So I've got either six months or a year before I go for director. I think =
given the current climate and given like where the market is at, I am =
certainly not in any rush to push director at mid year again after I did =
that for consultant. So you've got, you've got some time or whoever picks =
me up has some time.

7:38
Okay, yeah, that's helpful. And the market does =
suck. Yeah.

7:46
It'S crazy. I mean what I keep hearing is that there's =
people on the bench and that the people on the bench have sort of stayed =
there. And then when we're selling new work there's not a lot of like =
availability for the folks like in these circles. Like with Will, I've sort=
 of bounced from like one Will project to another. I've never been on the =
bench and I don't know what your experience is like, but it's definitely =
different I think today than it was a year ago for sure.

8:20
Yeah, my experience is kind of different because I've had, I've made a bad =
habit of working with like partners that are retiring. So Ajay Baudia used =
to run like west coast and he and I did. What did we do? Gap and we also =
did Everest and then he left and I worked with Alan Kyle. He, he left and =
Sumi left.

8:50
Yep. Yes. Sumi was my ccl. I was, I was on Sumi projects =
pretty much until she left. Like I was working with Sumi and Eileen on =
their like west coast stuff.

9:03
That's kind of just unfortunate =
situation with, with her leaving. So I don't have the full story.

9:08
But you know, nobody does. I, I, I, it did well, it.

9:14
Was alcohol related but I don't really know. Yeah, you know what exactly =
happened?

9:20
That's usually how it goes, which is unfortunate, but. Okay=
, well, yeah, why don't you talk to Will and keep me posted. I need to have=
 a conversation with Will as well. Just about like what I'm doing. But I =
was talking to Anthony and the business managed apps team today and Will =
about making a change and I think that that's something that I'm trying to =
put in motion. So I appreciate the call too.

9:55
You want to change on =
what?

9:58
Just like business managed apps. I think that as we approach =
day one, we've gotten to the point where like my role here is mostly =
finished and we have Pari and Tim Patrick now. Like when I joined it was =
just me and Anthony Lockley on this work stream and we've now staffed it =
with Tim and Pari. And my interest is really not in like this app's work =
stream or with rtx and there's an opportunity to make a change and I'm like=
 actively trying to do that.

10:38
Okay. Make a change to the demo project=
.

10:40
Yes. Yeah, exactly. Like sort of while I can. Parry is up for =
director and I, I don't, I don't know if it's going to happen but Pari and =
Anthony ran business manage apps together. Before Pari joined this project =
she was running Hornet, which was another RTX spin off. And then when that =
wrapped up, she came over here and brought I think all of the Hornet =
experience to this project. So I think that we are adequately covered on =
business managed apps or overly covered honestly. And it would be great to =
do something different.

11:28
Okay. Yeah, I've heard people aren't always =
the biggest fan of RTX either.

11:32
Yeah, it's a really hard client for =
sure. It's a really, I mean it's a hard client. Everybody says, oh, every =
client is hard. But RTX is different in some ways. And it's another one of =
those forever projects that will go like, just like GE Healthcare was and I=
. GE Healthcare became like I could never get off of that thing. And I =
think RTX has a tendency to like suck people in as well. So it's good.

12:04
Both wheel projects.

12:06
Yeah, those were both wheel projects.

12:08
Very well. Good for Will on that end. Do you have any other partners =
on, on the RTX sale or.

12:14
No, it's actually mostly nonin. So Will is =
not really even on this project anymore. It's mostly Nandin on RTX and Skip=
 Shoal a little bit. He's an md, so it's Skip a little bit and Nandin in =
the day to day. And then Will is, I think Will has like oversight but he's =
not directly involved.

12:47
Got it. Okay.

12:48
I think he's been more =
involved with Honeywell.

12:52
Yeah, he's, he's very hands on here.

12:54
Yes. Which would be great. I mean I love when you like working for Will. =
You. I mean I developed. You have to develop a sense for how he works and =
accept it and once I did, I enjoyed working with Will. I love his hands on =
approach. So it's great to hear that he is There. And I think that that =
makes sense to me now that like, that's where he's spending his time. Were =
you guys just out here or. He went out somewhere in New Jersey this week.

13:29
So. Yeah, I was supposed to be in Mars Plains this week too, but my =
wife was in the hospital Sunday to Monday.

13:36
Oh, gosh.

13:38
So, yeah, hopefully we'll see. She's gonna have a surgery, so I don't know.=
 I may not travel next week either.

13:44
So I'm so sorry to hear that. I =
hope that she's all right and that surgery goes well. That's a really like,=
 scary thing.

13:54
All good there. But yes, the team does travel to New =
Jersey, Miami and then Charlotte. So it's kind of a combination of those.

14:05
Yeah, that sounds about right for Will. That sounds about right, I =
think. Is there somebody else from Denver on Honeywell?

14:14
There may be. I'm not sure.

14:16
I don't know. I feel like whoever my. I =
was assigned a buddy and I can't remember his name, but I connected him =
with Will and he got put on one of Will's projects, but I don't know which =
one.

14:33
Wouldn'T be Oliver.

14:34
NBA guy. I can't remember in the =
military. But anyway, so I think that this is good. It really just depends =
on like what the need is on the Honeywell side. It sounds like the costing =
switch out is not the best go forward approach. But I think that if there =
is like team expansion or the opportunity for it to help out on either the =
PMO side or some of like the day one planning and then execution. When are =
they TSA ing like very much at Honeywell or are they. Is a lot of the =
execution going to take place like prior to day one?

15:22
They're TSA quite a bit. So it's like 98 applications is what the current =
TSA plus, you know, obviously like infrastructure and some of those items.

15:33
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What business. What business is it at Honeywell?

15:39
Advanced materials.

15:40
Okay. Yeah, advanced materials. Okay. I =
mean, what do they manufacture? Is it like, is it like a hands on =
manufacturing or is it like research or like, is it industrials?

15:54
I. I'd say it probably lands and. Industrials.

15:57
Yeah.

15:58
Like I've only been here a week, so I haven't gotten into, I would say the =
weeds on some of that.

16:03
Yeah, yeah. Well, how's your first week been?=
 How has your first week been? Have you worked with Will before?

16:10
I have not. Well, nothing. I have done pitches with Will, so we did like a =
pitch to the CIO at Colin's Aerospace. Then I Was thai led on zero based =
budgeting. I have not worked with him outside of that. I was probably like =
in the industrial space because my sectors are industrials and life =
sciences. And I was primarily working with Alan Kyle who was, was leading =
industrials until he announced his retirement. And now it's Will leading =
industrial.

16:42
Okay. Yeah, Will is good. Definitely an acquired taste. =
But he's, he's, he's a smart guy for sure.

16:51
Oh yeah. You know, he and=
 I get along well.

16:54
That's awesome.

16:55
Kind of complement each =
other.

16:57
That's good.

16:59
I think Will likes to kind of throw =
grenades into and see like if people have really thought through what =
they're presenting. Yeah. And I'm very like methodical and like hey, I want=
 you to do XYZ and document all that. So it complements pretty well.

17:19
That's great. I mean that's what I am certainly looking for is like someone=
 who is methodical and I, I love to hear that. I, I see what you mean about=
 Will with the grenades and I think that I tend to fall not, not as much on=
 that end of the spectrum. More like I'm a very, very logical, like =
structured person in the way I think and do work.

17:46
So.

17:46
Yeah, it's, I, I agree with you. It complements Will's style of. Sometimes =
it feels like chaos, but it's, it definitely makes me think. For sure.

17:58
Yeah. A little chaotic. Used to working with us.

18:03
Yeah. Okay. Well, I think, I think, I think we should be. Be good. Let me =
know what if anything, the outcome of your conversation with Will is. I =
need to have a, like a follow up conversation with him as well. But I mean =
are there any next steps or is there anything that I can do or you might =
need from me?

18:32
I'll connect with Will. I told him I'd get back to him=
 today on where I, I thought that would be the best place to, to get you =
plugged in. So I'll talk.

18:42
Okay. Okay. That sounds great. Thank you, =
Lane.

18:45
All right.

18:46
Thank you. Have.

18:47
Sounds good. Have, have a, a safe and safe life back.

18:51
Thank you. Yeah, you as well. And have a good weekend. I'll definitely be. =
I'll say a prayer for you and your wife and if not I'll Let me know the =
outcome of the wheel conversation. Okay, thanks Lane.

19:07
Bye.

where Will&#x27;s always gonna say like program needs first, you know, like=
 our team needs and then personal needs. But my, my thing is like I always =
want to get people experience on something that they&#x27;re actually =

more of a PMO type role like costing in tsa I feel like is something very =

type of level of experience you&#x27;re looking for there. And I think that=
 like I would love to learn it, but it would Be just that it would be =
learning it rather than like bringing experience doing it. Like, my =
exposure has been like, really later in the life cycle after costing has =
been done. The TSAs have been written. Other than like one very small deal =
at the beginning of my career where I worked on costing, it hasn&#x27;t =
