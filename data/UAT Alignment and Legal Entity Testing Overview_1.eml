UAT Alignment and Legal Entity Testing Overview

# Meeting Summary =
=E2=80=93 June 6, 2025

## Attendees =20
(Not explicitly named, but =
reference to Sriram, Finance, ISC, HR, PMO, Justin, Gokul, and other =
functions.)

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. **User Acceptance =
Testing (UAT) and System Owner Alignment**
- **Scope of UAT:** =20
  - UAT is function-led, spanning 82 (=E2=80=9Cbuild back=E2=80=9D) out of =
296 total systems. =20
  - Syncing of test windows and coordination with =
various function teams is required. =20
  - System owners need to be =
clearly identified for every impacted application, especially for "build =
back" systems.

- **Function Involvement:** =20
  - Finance, ISC, HR have =
already provided their lists of system owners and the systems involved.
  - Process for identifying and collecting owner names to be repeated for =
other functions.

- **TSA (Transition Service Agreement) Systems:** =20
  - TSA systems (remaining under Honeywell on Day 1) have unchanged service=
 owners, but basic access (Athens ID) verification needed.
  - Only =E2=80=9Cbuild back=E2=80=9D systems (82) specifically require new=
 owner identification.

- **Inventory Tracker:** =20
  - An inventory tracker exists (Excel/Smartsheet), functions will be asked=
 to fill out service owner information for impacted systems.
  - For clarity, only the 82 =E2=80=9Cbuild back=E2=80=9D systems (not all =
296) require new assignment and detailed tracking.

---

### 2. **Systems and Processes Impacted by Legal Entity (LE) Changes**
- **Identifying Affected Systems:** =20
  - Initial estimate was 22 =
LE-impacted systems, later corrected to 25.
  - These are systems required =
to be tested specifically for Legal Entity and "BRV" (Business Readiness =
Validation) reasons.

- **Categories of Systems:** =20
  - **LE-Impacted (BRV) Systems:** ~25 systems spanning ERP, HR (HRM, =
payroll), Finance, Supply Chain, and others.
  - **Non-BRV Systems:** Other=
 10+52 systems going live in June=E2=80=93Oct (e.g., Microsoft rollout), =
not directly involved in LE/BRV but need tracking due to overlapping =
timelines.

- **Downstream Testing:** =20
  - ERP legal entity changes =
necessitate downstream validation in connected systems (e.g., data =
replication to EDW, order processing in Salesforce).
  - End-to-end processes need to be tested across all systems that interact=
 due to LE changes.

---

### 3. **Test Planning and Progress Tracking**
- **Core Data to be Collected per System:** =20
  - Athens service owner =
identification.
  - UAT/SIT start and end dates.
  - Number/percentage of =
test scripts/scenarios defined, executed, and completed.

- **Tracking Challenges:** =20
  - Work plans and Smartsheet bundles do not=
 map 1:1 with 82 systems; granular tracking required.
  - Functions likely to enter broad test windows, so additional repository =
or heat map view will be needed for granular data.

- **Tooling and Data Integration:** =20
  - Discussion around syncing data =
between Smartsheet, Excel trackers, and Capital Edge for source of truth.
  - Possibility to streamline updating and reporting by leveraging already =
built integrations (Smartsheet =E2=86=94 Capital Edge) but may require =
model changes.

---

### 4. **Preparation and Logistics for Upcoming =
Alignment Calls**
- **Purpose:** =20
  - Prepare for a series of =
"alignment" calls with functional stakeholders (Tuesday=E2=80=93Thursday =
next week, with potential follow-ups).
  - Calls will finalize owners, =
validate system-process mappings, align on test planning.

- **Key Agenda Items for Alignment Calls:** =20
  - Finalize owners, roles,=
 responsibilities.
  - Finalize test scenarios and test scripts.
  - Validate systems in scope.
  - Finalize test windows and calendar.
  - Align on entry/exit criteria for UAT.
  - Align on test logistics =
(locations, hardware needs, tools: JIRA, ALM, Excel, etc.).
  - Assign test signoff leads and clarify signoff responsibilities.
  - Confirm process for capturing test tracking, reporting, and MOS =
(Measures of Success) cadence post-alignment.

- **Inputs & Outputs:** =20
  - Inputs: Updated tracking sheets, proposed agenda/templates, lists of =
owners/scenarios from each function.
  - Outputs: Aligned tracking, role =
assignments, clear next steps, set test windows, agreed logistics, action =
items for any unresolved points.

---

### 5. **Reporting and =
Dashboarding**
- **Data Ownership:** =20
  - Functions are responsible for =
updating test progress/data.
  - IT and PMO coordinate reporting structures=
.
- **Dashboard Data Sources:** =20
  - Test completion, scenario coverage,=
 and process tracking will be pulled from trackers for dashboarding =
(primarily in Capital Edge).

- **Approach to Test Scenarios & Scripts:** =
=20
  - Functions provide business scenarios; IT helps develop detailed =
test scripts.
  - Actual test script tracking may be in JIRA for some =
groups; need to confirm and if so, receive JIRA reporting.

---

### 6. **Call Scheduling and Communication**
- **Call Logistics:** =20
  - Placeholder invites to be sent out for alignment calls, final agenda to=
 be confirmed Monday.
  - Multiple sessions (Tues-Thurs) split by function,=
 with follow-ups scheduled as needed.
  - Slides and bullet-pointed =
outcomes/expectations to be created for clarity.

- **Slide/Material =
Preparation:** =20
  - Content to include tracking requirements, agenda, =
expected outcomes, and clear action items for each function.
  - Use of left-to-right input/output visual slide to facilitate discussion=
.

---

## Action Items

1. **Send Functions the Inventory Tracker** =20
   - Direct ask for completion of Athens service owner names and other =
relevant fields for all 82 =E2=80=9Cbuild back=E2=80=9D systems.

2. **Prepare/Refine Granular Tracking Mechanism** =20
   - Ensure a view or tracker exists for SIT/UAT dates, owners, and status =
info at an app level (beyond what work plan bundles provide).

3. **Develop and Share Alignment Call Agenda** =20
   - Draft agenda with =
bullet points (owners, scenarios, systems in scope, test windows, =
entry/exit criteria, logistics, signoff).

4. **Create/Update Slides for =
Monday=E2=80=99s Prep Meeting** =20
   - Input/output visualization, =
expected outcomes, and actionable example items.

5. **Placeholder Calendar=
 Invites** =20
   - Send initial invites for alignment calls =
(Tuesday=E2=80=93Thursday), indicate agenda will be finalized Monday.

6. **Coordinate with PMO on Reporting Structure** =20
   - Confirm who owns tracker/data ingestion and reporting, define process =
for updating and maintaining test progress.

7. **Confirm =
Integration/Synchronization Process** =20
   - Technical validation that =
Smartsheet, Capital Edge, and Excel trackers are synchronized as designed, =
with appropriate data model adjustments as required.

8. **Logistics Clarification** =20
   - For each function, confirm test =
location, required equipment, tool preference, and align with IT/IAM on any=
 access or hardware needs.

9. **Action Plan for Alignment Call Outcomes** =
=20
   - Ensure each item (owner identification, test windows, logistics, =
etc.) is assigned a responsible party and tracked to closure.

---

## Follow-Up Points

- **Alignment Calls:** =20
  - Conduct functional =
alignment calls Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday next week, with follow-ups as =
needed into the following week.

- **Weekly MOS for UAT:** =20
  - Once alignment achieved, weekly Measures of Success (MOS) calls to =
monitor UAT progress, issues, and report status.

- **Finalization and =
Distribution of Materials:** =20
  - Slides and call content to be =
finalized by Monday morning, distributed with finalized invite updates.

- **Additional Clarification on Reporting and Logistics:** =20
  - Separate session with PMO as needed to clarify cross-functional process=
 for process scenario/test tracking logistics.

---

## Significant Decisions & Discussions

- **Limiting Tracker Data Entry:** =
=20
  - Only 82 =E2=80=9Cbuild back=E2=80=9D systems require new owner =
assignments and UAT granularity, not all 296 systems.
- **Tracking vs. Reporting:** =20
  - Recognition of limitations with =
current work plans/bundling and shift to more granular system-level =
tracking.
- **Division of Responsibility:** =20
  - Functions own business =
process/scenario definition; IT/PMO support test script creation, tracking,=
 and reporting.
- **Benefit of Alignment Calls:** =20
  - Critical to clarify roles, close gaps, resolve test logistics details, =
and set up tracking/reporting cadence before UAT begins.

Because technically the UAT is a function led exercise for these 84 systems=
 or 82, they still need to do some UAT and we need to sync up with our test=
 windows and all that, but more so spend time. This is a bit of a different=
 thing. We can talk to Sriram as an example or the equivalent in finance. =
We've got five names in finance that are going to be talking. Talking to us=
, but more so around. Yeah, So a lot more around. Two, a bit more around, =
you know, the third one on top. So that's where. Now all of these are =
intertwined because we need to get the names. When it's the same system =
owners that are touching here that they will need to touch here if they're =
in the same space like erp. But if it's a brand new system here that's not =
changing but they're touching it, we're going to need the names similar to =
what this guy said. So the call to action where the outcome of all of this =
is when we're talking to them Monday, we want to tell them that we've got =
this inventory tracker that they need to go fill out for these, you know, =
whatever you have as a tracker that we need to give them very specifically =
go fill out the owners, the pictures and the catcher names so that this =
work can happen. Sorry. So that this work can happen.

1:28
And that. That's across all of the 296, not just the.

1:33
That would be 296.

1:35
Technically that's not just across the 82.

1:40
True. But keep in mind. Well, let's put it this way.

1:47
I'm just in my mind trying to plan what to give them.

1:50
Sure. So think of it this way. 82, certainly they need to go fill out. =
Let's talk about TSAs. TSAs, the owners may be changing, but the processes =
are by the existing Honeywell. It's on a tsa, so the systems are not =
changing. Right. So it's still Honeywell.

2:12
Yeah. Other than does your =
Athens ID work.

2:14
And whatever, then it's just it from an access =
perspective, does your Athens ID work to log in to test?

2:22
Yeah.

2:22
But the service owner is still Honeywell. So you're not getting a new =
service owner.

2:29
Well, the only ones that we need service owners for =
are build back, which is the 82.

2:37
Right. So that's what you're asking =
them. So going back to your point you made, it's just the 82 mostly.

2:42
Yeah.

2:44
Where you will come in here is if they want those systems, we =
just give them the Honeywell system owners here. If they're in the TSA list=
.

2:54
Yeah, exactly, because.

2:58
So you don't need 296 here, you just =
need the 82.

3:05
Yeah. So we need Honeywell and Athens system owner for =
the AD2 and then we already have the Honeywell system owners for the =
whatever. Do you want to. Do you think it would be a good idea to develop a=
 generic version of what promote shared with you for ISC and use that to =
distribute to the other functions to get them started.

3:41
The functions have to come and give us that.

3:43
Yeah.

3:44
And if you recall, the functions and Finance already gave us that too.

3:49
Yeah, we have it from Finance, we have it from isc.

3:53
Okay. And then you have it from HR as well because we know it's those two =
systems that they touch. HCM and payroll.

4:02
Exactly.

4:03
Okay, so you have a view of the systems in touch. The whole point was we =
thought it's 22 systems. We have to make sure you know what is really =
getting touched for legal entity and BRV. So it's not 22 but 25. We just =
need to list that 25 out as systems that are impacted by legal entity and =
need to be tested for legal entity.

4:29
What category, what category do =
those ones like from that ISC list that are not on our. They're not BRV =
because they're not build back are those.

4:43
So keep in mind. So two =
things, build back and move as is has nothing to do with brv. They are =
generic dispositions that is there for day one.

5:00
Yeah. Do you know what I'm saying though? Like the.

5:03
I know what you're saying.

5:04
Yes.

5:04
What we need to look at is =
which of that 82 is specifically legal entity related that get impacted by =
changes to legal entity. So a case in point, erp. ERP is not a build back. =
It's not a move as is. It's actually a TSA on day one. But on August 1st =
you're making legal entity changes in that system that's going to be on a =
tsa. So you need to test that system and it's in scope for. For brv.

5:42
Yeah.

5:45
There are other systems that he has listed like EDW that's also=
 changing around that time frame. But that's also in scope for BRV because =
there are data reports that flow out of ERP into it and they'll use those =
reports and the data and analytics in there and they have to look at it at =
a legal entity level. So all those systems in supply chain he gave you are =
getting touched during brv. The question is which one of them you know so =
we can say this is the impacted systems. Systems in scope for BRV Are these=
 however many he has in that list, 17 or 18 plus. We need to look at what =
the finance guys have given. I think they gave us 7 or 8.

6:33
Yep. And then HR 2 and then plus.

6:35
The 2 for HR. So you're looking at.=
 And then I don't know if there's any other, any other function.

6:42
What about engineering or like dni?

6:44
Look at engineering. Engineering,=
 data engineering, R D probably is. We may have one system that I don't =
know what might be legal entity change related but I doubt there is any. So=
 it truly is legal entity changes are, you know, I need to meet, I need to =
pay people out of the right legal entity. So your PayCheck comes on August =
5th.

7:10
So is that one. So that's one category of them. Is there another=
 category of them?

7:14
No, no, there's only one related to legal entity.

7:19
I'm saying legal entity is one category of them.

7:23
For systems.

7:25
Yes.

7:26
Yeah. So the rest of this is non legal entity related which=
 is there are systems going live around the same time that have nothing to =
do with legal entity. Like I don't know, let's just say Microsoft. Yeah, =
Microsoft is going live on August 1st and we need to probably add that too =
because there's a testing on Microsoft as well. If you recall the =
conversations that these guys were talking about. They talked about pilot =
users and the PC rollout and all that stuff. We talked, talked about. Yeah,=
 the pilot users of our, you know, email pilot users and testing and all =
that. So Microsoft is a good example that they're starting work on August =
1st to roll out new email and new tenant and OneDrive. All that, that has =
nothing to do with any legal entity work. It's just happening at the same =
time. So those are the non BRV systems, if you will. So these other, other =
10 +52 that we have or however many that are build back and move as non BRV=
 related but happening around the time frame which is this stuff. So =
technically Speaking it's actually 10 plus 52. And then we have, you know, =
there are LE related changes which are probably like the 25 or 27 or =
whatever it is. So it may not end up being 82, let's say for the sake of =
this 22 and let's say this is 10. So for whole numbers we will need to =
validate these. These 10 are going in June and July. These 50 are going in =
August and September and October.

9:09
Yeah.

9:10
So August, September. They have nothing to do with legal entity they just =
so happen that they need to be built back and move as is and they're going =
around in that time frame. ERP is the main one that is legal entity and =
thus this other stuff that. So the changes are made in the ERP in the whole=
 or on the main coming out of those changes. You can think of all the =
downstream systems that now need to validate that those changes took place =
in the erp. So all those supply chain systems, most of them are downstream =
systems that we'll have to validate that those changes, those legal entity =
changes that happen in the ERP can now be seen. If I created a new legal =
entity for Athens in the ERP and I created a new cost center company code, =
however, that hierarchy is I create new legal entity, then if I'm able to =
go enter an order against that legal entity in the salesforce, then I know =
that change took effect.

10:13
Yeah.

10:15
And so this end to end process=
 testing is around that to say okay, can I enter a new order against this =
new legal entity because it's brand new. So that's where the process =
cutover happens. So the end to end process testing is around. That is can I=
 do an end to end of raising an order, raising a sales quote, raising, =
paying the quote, collecting the cash, delivering the goods. All of that =
has to happen on the new legal entities that have been set up for Athens.

10:44
Yeah, exactly.

10:47
So a lot of them the setup is in erp, erp. But =
then there's a lot of downstream systems that need to get to reflect that =
legal entity because the name of the company will change. Like you know, =
Athens Solzes Hong Kong Inc. Is a brand new company in Hong Kong. Before it=
 was Honeywell Hong Kong. Now it's holes. Well as. And it may have a new =
address, it may have a new shipping label, it may have a new tax id. All of=
 those things will have to get tested as part of this, this end to end =
process testing. Again, I digress from our main point, which is for Monday,=
 what do we need to ask them? So if you go back to your list, we're saying =
we need to ask them for service owners for these applications. We then need=
 to. The other couple of things on the inventory tracker that we talked =
about.

11:39
Hold on, I'm just pulling it back up.

11:41
Okay.

11:48
Give me one moment. There we go. Come on. Okay.

12:06
On your first page, what do you have? You have to ask for service owners.

12:12
Yeah, I think we were using this one. This is like the, this is the =
service owners.

12:18
So server service owner identity and yeah, so it's =
not identity, but they're essentially going to complete that. Right, so =
you've already. Okay, then they're going to validate that the sit UAT dates=
 that are there that are accurate and they need to go update it in the =
smartsheet work plans. Now, the challenge is the smartsheet work plans =
don't necessarily consist of 296 apps. They bundle certain apps, they =
bundled other things. So they don't. Not for 296, but at least for the 82. =
They don't. They don't necessarily consider they should ideally, but they =
don't. So we would need a view of the sit uat dates for those 82.

13:04
Yeah. What? Justin already has that because he has the heat map from =
smartsheet and the heat map pulls directly from those work plans. So he has=
. Has a mapping. Yeah, he has a mapping of which apps are in which work =
plan and where.

13:20
So we need them to validate that that is accurate, =
that that heat map is right.

13:26
Exactly.

13:28
Now how they do that is we have to give them the heat map and we say go =
update the work plans because it'll get pulled here. Please go update work =
plans one by one. Yes. Now the challenge will be they are not going to do =
that. If you can imagine if. So just think through this and play this out. =
If I, if I say supply chain and let's say my whole thing is my plans are =
created differently and say my work plan, what will happen in supply chain?=
 What I see happening, and I'm using supply chain as an example. If you =
look at that list that Gokul sent us of the 50 or 16 apps, they all have =
sit uat dates across a wide range of dates. Some of them are the 2nd of =
June to the 20th of June and then there's a few stragglers and 2nd of July,=
 5th of July, etc.

14:18
Yeah.

14:19
So what these guys will go into the =
work plan and say is 2nd of June to 5th of July. They're not going to give =
us the granular detail. So work plans will not work for the purposes we're =
asking for.

14:31
Hmm, I see what you're saying. So you're assuming that =
they're gonna give you the. Yeah, yeah, they're gonna give us the broad =
dates of like the spanning of the whole thing, not down to the granular app=
 level detail.

14:44
So you can't use a work plans. Yes, I get it. It goes=
 into this. But we need a better view of where this is getting tracked. So =
we may need to create another view of the heat Map or a different version =
of it where we say, sit uat. Use that as a repository that we can then =
update. Have a sync to Capital Edge to get updated in Capital Edge.

15:08
Well, yeah, I mean, it's in our systems tracker. I would just say go update=
 our systems tracker with it.

15:13
But people don't have access to =
Capital Edge. Very few people have access.

15:17
Not a Capital Edge, our =
Excel.

15:21
Yeah, but how often do you have to maintain Excel? I would =
rather.

15:26
I would do like one load or.

15:28
Something, but if the =
SID date changes or something else changes, like where do they go in and =
say, okay, I give you these dates, but, oh, I'm delayed.

15:39
So, for example, ideally in smartsheet.

15:43
Ideally in smartsheet =
somewhere, but not in the heat map. It has to be somewhere else Smartsheet,=
 because in the work plan, they've given you a broad date. So the app may =
be delayed, but I'm still in the window.

15:55
I see what you're saying. =
So we need probably another consolidated place to track the.

16:04
These test dates and these. These tracker. So either we duplicate the =
tracker we have in Capital Edge and smartsheet so that it could be a sync =
that uploads and these guys only update the smartsheets.

16:15
Yeah, we could do that.

16:15
So instead of sending Brian port out of =
Capital Edge.

16:18
Exactly. Instead of sending Brian, like the Excel, I =
might just load it into smartsheet, sent him the smartsheet and that =
connection is already created. And he can handle the. The sync. Like the, =
the infrastructure to do the sync is already there.

16:33
Okay. But he may need to change the model. I think he'll need to redo the =
columns and stuff and do the sync.

16:38
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was =
oversimplifying, but yes, I think that that's actually a great idea. So =
that then there's like a live source of truth somewhere that they can edit =
and it gets incrementally updated. In Capital Edge.

16:50
In Capital Edge. And we don't need to babysit Capital Edge. Yeah, the =
reporting and the dashboard will still be there. And we run those out of =
there.

16:57
Yes.

16:59
So now these guys, again, I have. I'm in two =
minds whether to show them these dashboards, because I think after it's in =
Capital Edge, we can do it. But. So this would be the second ask that they =
go in and create this tracker. We create the tracker and they go update =
this at a granular level for these 82 apps.

17:18
Yeah. And I want to =
combine what we're asking them to do, because we can capture all of this =
data in the same place. The Athens service owners. Service owners for build=
 backs.

17:31
Non brv.

17:32
Yes, for non brv.

17:34
Actually just for all. In fact, put it for the 82.

17:36
Yeah, right.

17:37
Or 85 or 90.

17:38
Yeah. Athens service owners, UAT start, UAT end.

17:43
And then sit start. Sit end, UAT start, UAT End.

17:47
Yeah, exactly. And the, I would say the test script counts as well. Number =
of scripts defined, number build new, number use, existing. We have all of =
those.

18:03
I don't know if we get, I don't know if we need to get to =
that level, but eventually. No, we may not. So we may not need to that =
level.

18:12
We did talk about that.

18:14
How many test scripts? 100 for=
 this system. How many have you tested on? Yeah, I don't. It doesn't matter=
 if they've got 99 and 1, they have to create new or they've got 1 and they=
 got to create 99 new.

18:29
So can we just say number of test scripts and=
 then number complete.

18:34
Yeah. So we should say testing, you know, =
maybe and then later on we can add percentages if we want. Yeah, because we=
 should say test scenarios defined, test scope, know test cases defined or =
test cases developed. Or maybe the total test, you know, maybe scenarios =
are a business construct. Maybe we say total test cases, you know, against =
that system and then, you know, total, Total executed.

19:07
Yeah.

19:09
Now the problem is they may do that in jira, so they may say we do it in =
jira, we're not going to do it it here either. But we have to ask, we have =
to propose that and then let them sort out that everybody's doing it in =
jira and if it's not, then they have to come and do it here or you know, =
they, they update it here as well.

19:29
Yeah, I mean if they're doing it =
in jira, you, they can come back to us and tell that, tell us that. But =
until, but we have to get.

19:35
A report from JIRA then.

19:37
Yeah, but I mean, I'm just saying I think we can propose this until they =
tell us. No, no, we already do it somewhere else. Go get it from here.

19:43
Okay, so that's that. And then the third part then would be. Well, we=
 may have to look at a few more things in that smartsheet in the, in that =
tracker. Not the work plan, but it's a smartsheet tracker.

19:59
Yeah.

20:01
And then they're going to have to. We need that MOS for the next two =
weeks aligned on how we will again. The end result would be this alignment =
call happens and then UAT starts and we need a weekly MOS between The =
coordinators to understand what's going on with uat. But to get to there, =
we need to do all those other things I mentioned on aligning on all these =
things.

20:27
Yes.

20:28
And those are the prep calls, the alignment =
calls that we need for the next two weeks.

20:31
Okay. To get to those =
alignment calls for the next two weeks, we need to know what systems the =
processes touch.

20:42
Yeah. Or we should just say validate. Just say =
validate process system mapping. Validate test windows, Validate test =
scenarios and test scripts. Define, confirm and finalize roles and =
responsibilities.

20:58
For the weekly mos.

20:59
All your agenda. No, not the weekly mos for these alignment calls. That =
would be your agenda.

21:04
Yeah, exactly. I mean that's. I think that's =
pretty much what we have for the agenda. Where didn't. I thought we wrote =
the agenda together.

21:16
Let's add that as a bullet point here. Let's =
just, you know, let's put the bullet points here and call out agenda here. =
No need for newsletter slide. Just put it as bullet points here and say =
agenda would be, you know, align on. Align on roles and responsibilities, =
owners roles and responsibilities. Align on. It won't be that. It's more it=
 versus business. Like who's going to develop scenarios, who's going to =
load the scripts, who's going to vary, verify, you know, so align on. You =
know, somewhere in here we should also add align on test logistics at the =
bottom. And we should also say align on entry exit criteria. Align on test =
logistics. Align on. And all of these need content. So we need a slide to =
develop. So if we set up the call for Monday or Tuesday, we have some work =
to do that align on entry exit criteria. Align on. Maybe we say finalize =
instead of align on. Just say finalize owners roles and responsibilities. =
What else do we need to do that? Finalize test windows and test windows and=
 calendar. Validate systems, processes and systems in scope. Our systems in=
 scope. Let's just say systems in scope scope because they're going to come=
 in with the processes. Systems in scope. You know, finalize entry exit =
criteria or align on entry exit criteria. What else do you think they need =
to do in these alignment calls?

23:29
Owners roles and responsibilities, =
test windows and calendar, systems in scope, entry exit criteria, test =
logistics. Where's the. Where's the process.

23:44
That is the validate systems in scope against those processes.

23:50
Should we tell them that they need to bring the like come prepared to.

23:54
Speak to the processes functions already do that.

23:57
Okay.

23:58
Writing the functions. Functions will have it. And then we should also say =
validate, you know, validate test test scenarios Scenarios? Yeah, validate =
test scenario. That's the third, third bullet.

24:14
Yeah.

24:17
Validate test scenarios and test scripts, I would say.

24:22
I mean they need to provide us with those because the scenarios are based =
on the processes.

24:30
No. Yes. So who needs to provide what.

24:37
Do we have the test scenarios in advance?

24:42
Functions will share the =
test scenarios with the IT teams for them to help develop test scripts that=
 come out of it. So these alignment calls will be for functions to say =
these are the scenarios we've developed. Who do we meet to get the test =
scripts for these?

25:03
Exactly. So it's not like validating what we are =
bringing. I take validate to mean like, hey, these are the systems that we =
know for this function are in scope. Is this the full list or is there =
something that we're missing and anything related like the. The tertiary =
ones that you mentioned for Schare, that is the opposite of. That's =
homework for them. Bring these test scenarios to exactly what.

25:34
You just said, then say align or finalize.

25:37
Yeah.

25:43
Finalize test scenarios and test. Actually finalize test scenarios and test=
 scripts and move that to the third bullet. Actually second second bullet =
and I would actually move the test windows to the fourth, to the. To the =
fifth bullet just before test logistics. Now this is going to need a bit of=
 work because we probably need some templates for these. Either we're =
tracking them somewhere or we give, you know, we have to prepare some test =
entry, exit criteria and what into that meeting and say, this is our =
criteria. Do you all agree? Or we say, you know, here's some basic criteria=
. See if you guys want to refine this and develop this and come back to us.=
 So different ways that can go. But we need that conversation.

26:56
We definitely need to develop. We need to develop the temp or like the, the=
 templates. Right. For these.

27:09
What? Depends on what template.

27:11
I mean, to run the call. Right. So like the test script template and the =
scenarios template. Here's the scenario.

27:17
No, we don't. We don't. We =
are not developing anything. The function will have some Excel or some =
other way of sharing their scenarios and they may have already shared it =
with the IT teams for us to.

27:36
We will need to ingest that data in a =
standardized format to what to get it into ultimately Capital Edge or =
whatever we're doing reporting on.

27:51
No, there's no test scenarios =
that go into Capital Edge.

27:54
I'm not saying the test scenarios, but =
the. To be able to look at a system and say where is the system at in uat, =
you have to be able to answer the processes that are involved. Or if you're=
 talking about an end to end process what are all of the systems involved =
in this end to end process and where is each one of those systems at in =
their UAT testing?

28:19
No, that's again you're missing the point. Recall=
 that I said an app can be on a tsa. There's no UAT for that TSA but it's =
in an end to end. We talked about Salesforce. So you don't need to track =
where Salesforce is because nothing is happening to is just that the supply=
 chain team for an end to end process is using Salesforce as an end input.

28:44
So then what do we get out of these alignment calls? Like what is the=
 out, what is the outcome?

28:50
All of the stuff that we need to get =
tested. Everything in the row two and row three that I was mentioning.

28:56
And so to get tested who is going to track that? Like who is going to=
 act? Who is going to monitor these.

29:05
The test scenarios Again in the=
 BRV tracker. That's the BRV process tracker. When we talk about that pre =
in Capital Edge.

29:12
But the BRV process tracker doesn't have systems.

29:17
They you going to use the system inventory. It doesn't matter what =
system. So they're not going to track that. I touch 15 systems they're just=
 going to track that. I tested this process using this system. Remember the=
 conversation again to 296 systems plus there are other rows that the =
functions will go in and enter.

29:38
Yeah. So that's it. The functions =
will go in and enter then. I think that that was my question. Like I, I was=
 saying. Yeah. So we need a, a way to structure those conversations. Like =
I'm thinking about what pre work do we need to go into these functional =
alignment calls and have a coherent conversation with them to drive the =
output.

30:02
So it depends on what we are looking at here. The outcomes. =
So those are again in the logistics. So how are we going to track and =
report on these things? Those are. We have to work with PMO on It's not for=
. Because that's across the board.

30:15
Exactly.

30:15
The PMO will define and pre has already talked to the functions to say this=
 is how you're going to track them in the inventory tracker you're going to=
 go in and add these rows of sriram you're touching these processes in =
supply chain. You're testing these processes but you're touching these =
systems. Add a row for every system you touch across every process. That's =
the row he's done. So when he goes in and says I've completed This process,=
 that process can touch three systems. So he's going to go and say complete=
, complete, complete on those three rows.

30:48
Yeah.

30:50
Then the dashboard will pull off of that.

30:53
Exactly.

30:53
But if we want to talk of logistics here, that's not for this call. That =
would be a call with pre to talk about how are we going to run the =
scenarios. This is to get to running those scenarios. What do we need to do=
? How do we need to talk to each other? What is it that we need to prep up?=
 How do I define my scenarios and give it to you to do the test cases? How =
do we meet? Who's going to do what? Like I'm going to run the scenarios, =
you're going to report on it. I'm going to call you at this time to do this=
. I'm going to own the inventory. No you're not. I will. So that's the =
conversation here and then I'm going to say okay, who's going to do the =
sign off? You've tested on a system, functions are going to sign off on the=
 UAT was successful. So who are the owners and responses? Who's going to be=
 the test sign off lead that says okay, I now accept that the UAT was =
successful, that's all function. But the alignment call here would be the =
conversation around how do we, you know, who's the named resource against =
it? Who's got the responsibility? When will this happen? How are we going =
to check that against the entry and exit criteria? Because whoever's =
signing off is going to say before you start testing, I'm going to to let =
you test if I've passed all the entry criteria. And when you, you do the =
testing then, and then when you're done testing you say okay, you've passed=
 everything. Is there any defect? No. Is there everything closed? Are all =
the system you can you see all the scenarios passed, There'll be a criteria=
 to exit and so the person, he or she who's signing off will look at the =
exit criteria and say okay, you've passed all the exit criteria. This =
process scenario, this test is complete, I can sign off. So these are the =
alignment calls we're going to be having to say what is this criteria? Are =
we aligned, etc. Etc.

32:46
Yeah.

32:48
Okay, so a lot to digest there. =
But again that's why these alignment calls are important. But we do need to=
 set them up and get the right people in and have the right call content =
for it. So this is going to take a bit of a prep work, but we need to tell =
a prep work, meaning you know, Monday, but we need to say, okay, we're =
setting up the call starting Tuesday, you know, Tuesday, Wednesday, =
Thursday, we do this individually and then you know, if we need follow ups =
we can do, you know, if Tuesday guy wants a follow up on Thursday, we set =
it up again on Thursday. But we at least propose that we have alignment =
calls on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday with different functions and then =
maybe a week later.

33:29
Yeah, that makes sense.

33:33
So and then the mos can kick off for UAT because some things may be =
starting in 2nd June, some things may be maybe okay, the system is doing =
okay, but the function doesn't need to get involved. The functional MOS is =
really more around this big process stuff that they need to talk about. The=
 functional MOS for the systems may not be a much of a thing. So again a =
lot of moving parts here but that's where we need to put some structure =
around it and have this conversation to tell these people how things are =
going to go.

34:12
Yeah, so that's the Monday piece.

34:15
Yeah, so that's all it connect that we need to tell them that these are the=
 details that we're going to be discussing. This could all be on a page on =
itself like here's what's going to be the focus of the alignment calls, =
here's what's going to be. So we may want to create a slide that says =
here's the content, here's the expected outcome. Right, A left to right =
slide that says and I think we've got some of those fairly standard slides =
that we can, you know, the template of which we can use but the content =
which we need to fill in, you know, stuff on, you know, here's the inputs =
coming in to the left hand side, here's the outcomes on the right hand side=
.

34:54
Yeah we do. I feel like I've seen at least one of them.

34:59
One or two, yeah. So we may need to create a slide like that on the Monday =
call to show with them and we can review that Monday morning. But it's a =
view to tell them this is the expectation because we'll add that into the =
meeting invite.

35:13
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

35:15
So I'll send placeholder invites but then we can add agenda items later on =
Monday and we say here's an updated invite, here's what the expected =
outcome is and you know, people should come prepared. So when we do come in=
, Sriram will lead with his Excels and say hey guys, you know team A, team =
B, team C, team D. This is what I have, these are the names I have. I need =
some Names. So we work through it. They give names, they complete the =
owners roles, responsibilities. Then they look at, then he says I've got, =
Listen, I've got 300 scenarios or 120 scenarios I need to talk to somebody =
about. I've talked to this person but I need for hr, I need to talk to =
somebody to develop the test scenarios or test cases. Okay. Then the =
conversation is okay, I'm finding a person. We will work with you and =
schedule an outcome. Or let's say one of the notes is okay, let's set up a =
call between, you know, the IT guy is going to set up a call with a, with =
Sriram's guy to develop test cases and complete it by Thursday. We just =
capture that as a note. Then they'll say okay, let's align an entry exit =
criteria. We need a separate call for that. This looks good. Let's take =
this away. We will come back and give you something back by Thursday. Okay,=
 that's an action item. We follow up on Thursday. Test windows. They look =
at it and go okay, this works, this works. This one will have to adjust. =
Let's work with you. If there's some adjustments we take an action item and=
 then logistics. They'll say okay, who are we aligning on? Is it Jira, is =
it alm, is it Excel? So we decide that and we say okay, how would, how our =
people testing are we getting laptops? Is, are they all going to a room in =
a Central park location in New Jersey and testing will we have EMEA and =
APAC testing? So that's the second con there conversation and maybe it's =
not solved. If it's solved, great. If not we should at least have a point =
of view. We say okay, this would be laptops here. And you know, something =
like that. If it's realistic, we do. If they have a better idea, we change =
it. But then we have the IAM team and others involved to say okay, oh we =
need three laptops shipped to China with Solstice image so that they can do=
 this testing or this testing won't involve that. They're going to ask, it =
doesn't matter. They're just a Solsys user because they're a test user. =
They are, you know, they're going to test the scenarios. They're Solsys =
users. They'll be, you know, they'll be given Solstice logins, test login. =
So when they log into the system they will test it as a Solstice user. So =
those are the kind of logistic discussions we have logistics discussions we=
 will have. So it's probably a 60 to 90 minute call Tuesday, Wednesday, =
Thursday to talk through these things and lay everything out and then say, =
okay, they have a few follow ups. We close these by the following week and =
we set up an MOS for how they will conduct the testing and report on it.

38:14
Yeah, okay.

38:18
So again, a bit of work for us to do there, but =
yes, so again, we need some content against these bullets because we need =
either Excels with names in there or we need, you know, action items for =
the, you know, the system and scope. Some of that stuff, they will bring =
some of the stuff we need to repurpose what we have or create a slide that =
shows that.

38:41
Okay, so, okay, I'm aligned.

38:45
Okay, cool. So let me take a pass of.

38:49
That today, tomorrow for the =
Monday, all it call and then I think we do need at least one page on the =
Monday. Here's what that call is going to look like. Here's the inputs, =
here's the outputs. And then also this with just the calls to action and =
those examples for each.

39:16
Okay, yeah, take a pass at that. Send it to=
 me when you can over the weekend and then we'll finalize it Monday morning=
.

39:22
Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.

39:24
Cool, cool. All righty.

39:25
Okay, thanks for cash. I'll talk to you later.

39:27
All right, talk later then. Bye.

39:29
Bye.

<ul>
<li>UAT is function-led, spanning 82 (=E2=80=9Cbuild back=E2=80=9D) out of =
296 total systems.  </li>
<li>Syncing of test windows and coordination with=
 various function teams is required.  </li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Function Involvement:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Finance, ISC, HR have already provided their lists of system owners and=
 the systems involved.</li>
<li>Process for identifying and collecting =
owner names to be repeated for other functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">TSA (Transition Service =

<ul>
<li>TSA systems (remaining under =
Honeywell on Day 1) have unchanged service owners, but basic access (Athens=
 ID) verification needed.</li>
<li>Only =E2=80=9Cbuild back=E2=80=9D =
systems (82) specifically require new owner identification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Inventory Tracker:</strong>=
  </p>
<ul>
<li>An inventory tracker exists (Excel/Smartsheet), functions =

are systems going live around the same time that have nothing to do with =
legal entity. Like I don&#x27;t know, let&#x27;s just say Microsoft. Yeah, =
Microsoft is going live on August 1st and we need to probably add that too =
because there&#x27;s a testing on Microsoft as well. If you recall the =
conversations that these guys were talking about. They talked about pilot =
users and the PC rollout and all that stuff. We talked, talked about. Yeah,=
 the pilot users of our, you know, email pilot users and testing and all =
that. So Microsoft is a good example that they&#x27;re starting work on =
August 1st to roll out new email and new tenant and OneDrive. All that, =
that has nothing to do with any legal entity work. It&#x27;s just happening=
 at the same time. So those are the non BRV systems, if you will. So these =
other, other 10 +52 that we have or however many that are build back and =
move as non BRV related but happening around the time frame which is this =
stuff. So technically Speaking it&#x27;s actually 10 plus 52. And then we =
have, you know, there are LE related changes which are probably like the 25=
 or 27 or whatever it is. So it may not end up being 82, let&#x27;s say for=
 the sake of this 22 and let&#x27;s say this is 10. So for whole numbers we=
 will need to validate these. These 10 are going in June and July. These 50=
 are going in August and September and October.</div></div><div =

time frame. ERP is the main one that is legal entity and thus this other =
stuff that. So the changes are made in the ERP in the whole or on the main =
coming out of those changes. You can think of all the downstream systems =
that now need to validate that those changes took place in the erp. So all =
those supply chain systems, most of them are downstream systems that =
we&#x27;ll have to validate that those changes, those legal entity changes =
that happen in the ERP can now be seen. If I created a new legal entity for=
 Athens in the ERP and I created a new cost center company code, however, =
that hierarchy is I create new legal entity, then if I&#x27;m able to go =

logistics. Align on. And all of these need content. So we need a slide to =
develop. So if we set up the call for Monday or Tuesday, we have some work =
to do that align on entry exit criteria. Align on. Maybe we say finalize =
instead of align on. Just say finalize owners roles and responsibilities. =

against the entry and exit criteria? Because whoever&#x27;s signing off is =

Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we do this individually and then you know, if=

C, team D. This is what I have, these are the names I have. I need some =
Names. So we work through it. They give names, they complete the owners =

Listen, I&#x27;ve got 300 scenarios or 120 scenarios I need to talk to =
somebody about. I&#x27;ve talked to this person but I need for hr, I need =

 the conversation is okay, I&#x27;m finding a person. We will work with you=

let&#x27;s set up a call between, you know, the IT guy is going to set up a=
 call with a, with Sriram&#x27;s guy to develop test cases and complete it =

let&#x27;s align an entry exit criteria. We need a separate call for that. =
This looks good. Let&#x27;s take this away. We will come back and give you =
something back by Thursday. Okay, that&#x27;s an action item. We follow up =
on Thursday. Test windows. They look at it and go okay, this works, this =
works. This one will have to adjust. Let&#x27;s work with you. If =
there&#x27;s some adjustments we take an action item and then logistics. =
They&#x27;ll say okay, who are we aligning on? Is it Jira, is it alm, is it=
 Excel? So we decide that and we say okay, how would, how our people =
testing are we getting laptops? Is, are they all going to a room in a =
Central park location in New Jersey and testing will we have EMEA and APAC =
testing? So that&#x27;s the second con there conversation and maybe =
it&#x27;s not solved. If it&#x27;s solved, great. If not we should at least=
 have a point of view. We say okay, this would be laptops here. And you =
know, something like that. If it&#x27;s realistic, we do. If they have a =
better idea, we change it. But then we have the IAM team and others =
involved to say okay, oh we need three laptops shipped to China with =
Solstice image so that they can do this testing or this testing won&#x27;t =
involve that. They&#x27;re going to ask, it doesn&#x27;t matter. =
They&#x27;re just a Solsys user because they&#x27;re a test user. They are,=
 you know, they&#x27;re going to test the scenarios. They&#x27;re Solsys =
users. They&#x27;ll be, you know, they&#x27;ll be given Solstice logins, =
test login. So when they log into the system they will test it as a =
Solstice user. So those are the kind of logistic discussions we have =
logistics discussions we will have. So it&#x27;s probably a 60 to 90 minute=
 call Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday to talk through these things and lay =
everything out and then say, okay, they have a few follow ups. We close =
these by the following week and we set up an MOS for how they will conduct =
the testing and report on it.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;p=
