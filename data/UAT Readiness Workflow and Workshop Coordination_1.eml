Key Priorities and Discussions

Main Topics Discussed:

   1.

   UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Readiness and System Tracker
   - The highest priority is ensuring UAT readiness, specifically tracked
      through a =E2=80=9CSystem Readiness Tracker=E2=80=9D.
      - Emphasis on creating and updating a granular plan or checklist for
      UAT readiness, tracking completion down to scenarios and test scripts=
,
      aiming for daily clarity leading up to the 6/23 SIT (System Integrati=
on
      Testing) date.
      - Current challenges include the need for detailed work plans, gaps
      in granular day-by-day planning, and lack of fully validated app
inventory.
      - Over 60% of systems validated so far; need additional data modeling
      support (ideally from GDS or Honeywell BI resources).
      - Action items include developing the Smartsheet inventory, adding
      necessary data columns, and coordinating updates with workstream lead=
s.
   2.

   BRV Workshop Material & Readiness Slides
   - Preparing BRV workshop readiness slides is a significant focus, with
      tight deadlines:
         - 6/16: Internal review
         - 6/17: Review with Paul and leads
         - 6/18: Final submission
         - 6/25: Workshop in Charlotte
      - Coordination needed with Prashant and leads (Howida, Mahim, James,
      Yanji, Al, Mahesh, Steve Delat) for reviewing and finalizing workshop
      material.
      - Recommendation to collaborate in-person (Morris Plains) for certain
      sessions, with remote options for others.
   3.

   Functional Alignment and Office Hours
   - Continuation of IT and functional alignment office hours as a means to
      ensure data readiness and integration.
      - Proposed agenda items include reviewing UAT calendar, dashboard
      status, and addressing pending items or gaps.
   4.

   Dashboard and Reporting Alignment
   - Work is ongoing to mature the Capital Edge (CE) dashboard and align
      its data with the Smartsheet inventory.
      - Need to clarify with the PMO whether to maintain reporting/tracking
      in Smartsheet or migrate to Capital Edge.
      - Parallel efforts to refine dashboards with help from Brian and
      Pre/Brian.
   5.

   Resource Coordination and Next Steps
   - Need to identify and secure support from Honeywell BI resources to
      help manage inventory and provide data modeling capabilities.
      - Vicki Hamilton (based in Morris Plains) identified as a key person
      for detailed UAT readiness planning and coordination.
      - Action planned to meet with Vicki and formalize introduction for
      further collaboration.
      - Schedule and attendance logistics for Charlotte workshop confirmed
      (625 =E2=80=93 June 25th), with team members arranging travel and par=
ticipation.
   6.

   Communication and Action Planning
   - Plan to leverage Monday=E2=80=99s All IT Connect as a milestone for dr=
iving
      updates, showcasing progress, and making key asks to the broader team=
.
      - Suggestion to prepare several PowerPoint slides for the session:
         - UAT calendar
         - Readiness tracker status
         - Dashboard progress
         - Pending/gap items
      - Working sessions planned for later in the day/week to resolve
      outstanding issues, align data, and push updates to the inventory tra=
cker
      ahead of deadlines.

Action Items and Follow-Up:

   - Continue Smartsheet inventory enhancements and ensure all fields are
   filled out by workstream leads.
   - Confirm allocation of a Honeywell BI resource or determine backup
   support if GDS resources remain unavailable.
   - Coordinate with Prashant on content and facilitate reviews with
   identified leads, targeting 6/16=E2=80=936/18 for drafts and submissions=
.
   - Meet with Vicki Hamilton for detailed readiness planning and possibly
   in-person coordination next week at Morris Plains.
   - Prepare and circulate PowerPoint updates for the Monday All IT Connect
   meeting.
   - Align with PMO on dashboard/reporting tool of record.
   - Finalize logistics for the Charlotte workshop (arrival on 6/24,
   workshop on 6/25).

Images

The single described image shows a work-in-progress PowerPoint slide
focused on UAT and SIT readiness. Key elements include:

   - Table format with main topics (System Readiness Tracker, SIT/UAT, BRV
   Readiness Workshop slides, Functional alignment/office hours, etc.)
   highlighted in red.
   - Middle column focused on tasks and action items for UAT readiness
   (developing Smartsheet inventory, adding columns, driving completion,
   refining dashboards).
   - Reference to involving Honeywell BI resources for data modeling and
   tracker completion.
   - The slide reflects the operational priorities and task structure under
   discussion during the transcript, serving as both a status update and an
   action tracker.

Cash0:00
Some of the priorities that were left over from.
Paul0:02
Yes. Yesterday, this week, this week and next week, today and this. So
let's talk through. Let's put some bullet points in here. I've got.
Unfortunately I've got to talk to Paul in five minutes, but let's talk
through this. So priorities brv. Well, first things first, UAT readiness.
So what we really need to do is a few things here. And this is gonna take a
while, but I'm gonna put UAT readiness, the whole tracker. It's actually
systems tracker. Right. So where are we. We should understand where System
readiness tracker. That's situat. And so that's one. The other one is the
BRV workshop material slides or BRV readiness workshop slides.
Cash1:08
Yeah.
Paul1:11
Okay. And then the third one is.
Cash1:17
I have the follow up for Bill and Srinivas from yesterday. So like the
functional alignment and data gathering.
Paul1:26
Yeah, functional alignment and the office hours. That is actually going to
be huge priority and that may end up being. So activities here is we need a
system in. Well, is that the same as the system readiness tracker?
Cash1:48
Yeah.
Paul1:49
Okay, so what we need. And I spoke to and okay, so just for your
information, Bill and I connected with Sukai last night because she set up
some meeting for us. She was not. She was not. What's the right word?
Feeling great about uat. And because she hadn't had a report out, readiness
and such, I forwarded you a note I'd sent to her last night and this
morning a PowerPoint slide. But essentially giving her a view into. And
this is going to be. We're going to discuss this in Jeff's call in another
half hour. But I laid out for her what need, where we think the issues are
and the challenges. And she was not happy. And she's essentially today's
call with Jeff is probably not going to go that well. So we just need to be
prepared for it. But I see these are the areas where there are some serious
challenges in terms of it. Readiness functions seem to be ready. But the
biggest part is they're going to focus on it and say, you know, does it
have a detailed hour by hour plan? Not necessarily literally hour by hour,
but a detailed plan to. To start uat. Do you have a huge readiness plan of,
you know, a checklist of the hundred things you need to get done and by
whom and by, you know, and when, which we don't necessarily have. We have
it at a high level, but that's part of the conversation we need to have.
Cash3:22
Well, yeah, to get down to that granular level. I think that it's something
that we can do. It will require resources I think and significant
coordination to take the, I don't know the 15,000 foot view that we have
now down to the on the individual scenario and test script level to create
an hour by hour plan for the next two weeks.
Paul3:45
So don't take it literally. It's hour by hour. It's not that. So what I
mean truly is do you have a plan day by day to get to the 6:23 date? Like
we heard today, like 623 is the SIT. Until recently Srinivas was saying
there are two UAT windows. Yesterday he said the SIT window is this. Well
has it been publicized? Who decided that and where has it been socialized
across all of it? We didn't hear about it until on the HR call yesterday.
So stuff like that means people need to go back and update the work plans.
That yes, he said everything is in unit testing now, not in sit. So when we
get to our list of 75 apps have people updated that when it comes to
related to erp.
Cash4:34
I put that on low hanging fruit. In general the work plan updates.
Paul4:42
I.
Cash4:42
Would put that on low hanging fruit and try and use the Monday all IT
connect as a driver for that. Because if we can start to get. Me personally
it would be great. I don't know if we have a GDS resource but I have spent
so much time trying to wrangle all of the data into our data model and I
think now as of right now we have more than 60% of the systems validated
with the work streams for the ones that are BRV or BRV adjacent with all of
the dates and all of the information about them. But getting to that point
has been for, for me like the time that I've spent on it, a huge amount of
legwork that someone who is has better data modeling skills and maybe like
a GDS person to. To help integrate all of these data sources together would
be great and free up some of my time to work on these more strategic items.
Paul5:43
Understood. We just have to find the right a GDS person and I don't think
we have GDS resources available to support. Yeah, they're all busy there
and they're all occupied in other things as well. So. Yeah, so. So that's
the challenge. But no, I'm with you. I follow you.
Cash6:01
So if you shift that to the work plans and you get people to start putting
it in to the work plans in a structured way I think that we can avoid avoid
that.
Paul6:11
Yeah the challenge, though, is the work plans are not at an app level, as
you saw.
Cash6:15
Yeah.
Paul6:16
The work plans have been created where they are. So we have to derive that
inventory tracker that essentially has probably 50 fields and we need to
drive that and have people go in and update that to the best of their
ability. So that readiness tracker, if it is in smartsheets, we need to.
I'm going to say this as develop smartsheet inventory. If I can freaking
spell.
Cash6:45
Yeah. I'd use the one that Justin started and add all of the missing
columns.
Paul6:51
Add missing columns?
Cash6:52
Yeah.
Paul6:54
And have drive completion with work stream leads.
Cash7:01
So I basically start. I spent a couple hours yesterday evening pretty much
doing that. I have the model with all of the data that we have done right
now to get to this, it needs to be loaded into smartsheet. All of the
things like the validation, the dropdown and everything else needs to go
into it. But it's a.
Paul7:26
What we can try and see if it's not Honeywell, see if we have somebody.
Sorry, if it's not ey gds, if we have Honeywell resources that can drive
this.
Cash7:35
That's a great point. And Pierce. Pierce mentioned that there are folks
that he knows of that are BI people that do this at Honeywell. And I think
that that would be a very good question to ask.
Paul7:48
Is, hey, so, yeah, yeah, so that's the other piece is can we get Honeywell
BI resource to support it? But that's the driver. The first thing that we
really need because what this is going to give is visibility into sit UAT
readiness and gaps that we can close. The second piece is obviously the
Capital Edge dashboard linking inventory to process. Now, we may need to
run some reporting on that and add missing columns again. And that may be
some. Now the question is, if they do this in smartsheets, do we still
maintain it in smartsheets or do we maintain it in Capital Edge? This is
something we need to align with PMO on. On how do we use that? What is
there in Capital Edge to run reports. So if they start running some
reports, we'll at least know what is missing, how we can refine it, et
cetera. So there's a parallel drive to work with these guys. The Brian and
you know, work with.
Cash9:10
Brian is fantastically helpful Pre and Brian.
Paul9:16
On refining or maturing CE Dashboard either, you know, for this, the pro.
Yeah. So it's. It's link this, add, you know, add missing columns. And this
is the alignment with PMO on the dashboard to use. So these are the two big
things I see us doing to drive. This is going to be an urgent one because I
was just speaking to somebody that Sukai pulled in as a UAT helper. So I
think she's going to transition that from Pierce because of the urgency of
it and so that lady is going to develop a detailed plan. So that's. The
other piece is detailed UAT readiness plan. You know, have I done this?
Have I done that? Have I done. It's a checklist to get to the readiness.
Cash10:10
Can we meet with her? Where is she?
Paul10:12
Yeah, we will talk to her on the 10:30 call and then we can talk to her
after that.
Cash10:17
Okay.
Paul10:18
I just met with her five minutes ago. That's. I, that's. I just hung off
the call with her.
Cash10:23
I meant physically. I wonder if she's in Morris Plains and I can talk to
her now.
Paul10:27
Ah yeah, yeah. No Vicky, I don't know where she is. She may be. Let's ask
her that. I, I don't recall where she is but no, she is in Morris Plains.
It would be great. The other piece of this is the workshop slides. We have
to do a t minus so 618 submission and that means it's. Is it 618? No. Yeah.
Oh they said 618 for the 625 so it doesn't leave us much time Then that
means we need 616 internal 617 review with Paul and leads and then 618 end
of day submission. I thought 618 was a Friday but it's not, it's this. So
we don't have much time and that's why I was talking to priority Prashant
this morning on the 830 and I said we need some horsepower here. All hands
on deck to do this. And the other part of this is this review with Paul and
Leeds. If you are in Morris Plains can you go to Morris Plains next week?
Cash11:47
Yeah, yeah, I was planning to. So I talked to Prashant. He called my cell
this morning as we were. We were sort of talking about this. He said he
wanted to, to ramp a little bit and support and wanted to connect on like
where, where he can help. I think it would be, would be good to have
Prashant help to start to drive. At least you know how Prashant is with
his. He's very per. In his persistence and his drive. So with this one BRV
workshop readiness slides I think that that would be activity number two
that would be great for us to tag team next Week in MP as well.
Paul12:28
So set up time in MP with leads.
Cash12:36
Yes.
Paul12:37
So work with Prashant or whoever else.
Cash12:43
I need to know who's there.
Paul12:45
Yeah, no, well, we'll be there but.
Cash12:49
I mean which leads are there to set up that time with?
Paul12:53
Yeah, yeah. So it's. The leads are essentially Howida. So HR Howida is the
enterprise apps. There is Mahim and then there's James and we can invite
others. Yanji, Al, Mahesh. Who else? Who else? Who else? Steve Delat. If
they're in person, great. If they're not, Yunji and Al are in person. But
others can be virtual. And the idea would be review that and have it ready
and fill out. You know, I'll be there virtually. I'm not going to be in
Morris Plains. I can't. So. But the idea is, is to run that and have it by
end of day submission to PMO.
Cash13:51
Okay.
Paul13:51
Because 625 is the. 625 is the workshop in Charlotte. Charlotte.
Cash14:00
Yeah.
Paul14:00
So that you need to book your tickets as well.
Cash14:04
I've got that one on the calendar.
Paul14:06
Okay. And that I think I'm coming in on the 24th forth. But yeah, certainly
for this one. Okay. So yeah, those are the two main ones. And then this one
on functional alignment office hours. I think we need to continue to
continue that. But that's really more of an IT office hours. Right. So it's
a. It's. I would say it's IT alignment office hours and for the functional
alignment with. And then both of these are, you know, set up, set up time
next week. The challenge is some of this stuff is woven into this. If you
do the smartsheet inventory and you're driving that, then you know, you're
already doing that time.
Cash15:00
Well, that's the ask too. It's going to end up being the ask. It's like
here's the source inventory, here's the gas for you in your area. For IT
functional alignment, all IT connect.
Paul15:11
So we should do this is we need a couple of slides on UAT calendar. Slide
on UAT readiness tracker, a slide on gaps. And I think I have a couple more
slides on. On what is it? I have a slide on the hypercare approach, etc.
But that is okay. I can, I can work with the team on that. But at least
these. We need a slide on the UAT calendar. We need a slide on where we are
with the dashboard. Actually maybe that's the ask is let's create a few
slides to send the message to them. On the Monday all it connect that we
have a readiness plan that's missing a lot of things. So a slide on
smartsheet inventory and ask.
Cash16:14
Exactly.
Paul16:17
Slide on UAT calendar publishing a slide on what's pending slide on pending
items. So okay. Oops, sorry, Paul is pinging me but let me do this.
Cash16:35
Let me know we're totally aligned, I think.
Paul16:39
Okay.
Cash16:40
Yeah, this is. Yeah, we're totally alone. Okay.
Paul16:43
I just want to put dates against the as well. But at least you have a start
here. Let's talk through tactically day in and day out how we want. We
don't have much time, but let's talk through tactically and I set up a
couple of calls later today as working sessions. Talking to Prashant in the
morning about how do we do this? Can we set up a working session to fill
out some stuff then give it to our arpits and Rashids of the world to go
fill out their stuff by Monday so that we have what we have and then we
take it to the call on Tuesday, align it and submit it Wednesday.
Cash17:16
Okay.
Paul17:17
Right. The other piece of this is we'll have to get with Vicki. So this is
a piece we have to say on number one. We have to see how do we get with
this Vicki, I think I forwarded you the note from Sukai. So her name is
Vicki Hamilton.
Cash17:34
So let me see. Yeah, so I see review with Vicki. Could you maybe if you
spoke with her yesterday, could you make an intro?
Paul17:46
No, I, I just spoke with her five minutes ago before I called you.
Cash17:49
Did you, did you let her know that I'm on your team or could you make an
intro so that I can reach out to her and say, hey, I'm going to be in
Morris plants, we need to connect on these things next week.
Paul17:58
Yeah, no, I just spoke about the first slide and said, you know, this is
the status of it and we said we would talk at 10:30. So. Yes. So I'll make
the intro and then she's probably going to be the sort of coordinator or
the project lead to help provide some structure.
Cash18:15
Awesome.
Paul18:15
And do some detailed planning and then we'll have to work with her to get
that going. She's very driven as well because she's very method. She's very
familiar with their Honeywell IT and uat. So let me do this. Let me talk to
Paul right now.
Cash18:33
And then we have that call in 15. So you go talk to Paul and then we'll
connect after the poll. After the.
Paul18:38
Sounds good.
Cash18:40
Thanks for cash.
Paul18:41
Yes, 14 a bit fine.

it and say, you know, does it have a detailed hour by hour plan? Not necess=

have a huge readiness plan of, you know, a checklist of the hundred things =
you need to get done and by whom and by, you know, and when, which we don&#=

 into sit UAT readiness and gaps that we can close. The second piece is obv=

 need to run some reporting on that and add missing columns again. And that=
 may be some. Now the question is, if they do this in smartsheets, do we st=
