Global Project Testing Coordination And Readiness

# Meeting Summary =
=E2=80=93 June 20, 2025

## Attendees & Logistics
- **Date:** June 20, 2025
- **Time:** 10:33 AM
- **Participants:** 11 (including Jeff, Paul, Sheila, =
Vicky, Jessica, Bill, Sukai Crook [organizer], Mac P Connolly [guest], =
Rakesh Hariharan [guest], external attendees)
- **Location:** Video =
conferencing platform; participants joining from various global regions =
including North America, Ireland, and Asia.

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. **Project Readiness and Test Preparation**

#### **Status Update**
- Daily meetings have resulted in significant progress since the previous =
sync on Friday.
- **Critical and Adjacent Apps Identified:** All core =
applications and those requiring adjacent testing for End-to-End (E2E) and =
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) are catalogued.
- **Business Testers:**=20
  - Approximately 200 business testers involved.
  - 198 roles identified; =
some perform multiple functions.
  - About 98 unique testers spread across =
20 sub-functions.
- **Test Scripts:**
  - 139 scripts are completed.
  - Additional scripts for ERP and supply chain are being finalized today =
and Monday.

#### **Key Risks and Issues**
- **Geographic Diversity of =
Testers:**=20
  - Need more testers from regions outside North America =
(especially for Solstice).
  - Finance function presents particular =
challenges in regional representation.
  - New joiners (e.g., Dublin-based =
financial analyst) identified as assets for regional testing and knowledge =
transfer.
  - Action identified: Bring in testers from plants, Asia, =
Ireland, etc., and escalate requests to functional leaders (e.g., Finance =
via Tina).

- **Knowledge Transfer:** Clear recognition that UAT also =
serves as a mechanism for knowledge transfer, especially critical where =
there are new staff or region-specific nuances.

- **Escalations:**
  - For some applications (e.g., Edicom, certain tax applications in =
Romania, Germany, and Mexico), regional UAT testers have not been fully =
named due to unstaffed positions.
  - This gap is being addressed through =
leadership outreach and escalation (e.g., Ben Goldstein, Will Jay).

---

### 2. **Testing Approach and Scheduling**

#### **Testing Calendars**
- **System Integration Testing (SIT) & UAT:**=20
  - Detailed calendars =
have been socialized.
  - Next-level, granular schedules (with daily =
detail) will be published: SIT today, UAT on Monday.
- **UAT Phases:**=20
  - **UAT1:** Focuses on 80% of scripts, initial round including core =
business process validation and legal entity changes.
  - **UAT2:** Remaining ~20% of scripts and follow-up on defect resolution,=
 plus some activities requiring direct business user intervention (for =
example, report printing in Hyperion).
- **Early UAT Initiatives:**=20
  - Possibility for some regions to begin UAT as soon as SIT is complete, =
based on app/process readiness.

#### **Application Testing Details**
- All key and adjacent apps are mapped for testing readiness.
  - Gaps remain for specific regional tax and Edicom applications.
  - Existing QA environments and access are being utilized.

#### **Integration Testing**
- **Integration Points:** 76 identified; =
logical separation and bifurcation from previously shared systems (notably =
in ERP and integration with Honeywell=E2=80=99s environment).
- **Automation:** Large proportion of scripts (especially in ERP/supply =
chain) are executed via automation (Tosca).
- **Manual Testing:** =
Remainder=E2=80=94primarily finance and specific process flows=E2=80=94will=
 be hands-on, keyboard-driven by testers.

---

### 3. **Defect Management =
and Execution Tracking**

#### **Tracking and Reporting**
- **Twice Daily Reports:** Each day, morning and evening, teams will =
provide updates on:
  - Script plan vs. completion
  - Delays (by cause: =
defects, non-approvals, at risk)
  - Execution status (planned, completed, =
open issues)
- **Defect Capture:**
  - For automated scenarios (e.g., ERP =
LAS), defects managed via Tosca with direct reporting.
  - Manual defects (esp. in finance/processes) to be captured through =
separate reporting, with consideration for =E2=80=9Chands-on-keys=E2=80=9D =
involvement.
- **Defect Management Dashboard:** Dashboards will =
differentiate open issues by severity, stream/workstream, and process area.

#### **Automation vs. Manual Testing=E2=80=94Clarification and Framing**
- **Discussion of UAT Framing:**
  - UAT activity is a mix of regression =
testing, user acceptance, and output verification.
  - Jeff emphasized the =
need to clarify:
    - What is being changed and tested via automation =
(logical separation, integration).
    - What is truly UAT (hands-on, =
business validation).
    - What aspects (e.g., ADP payroll) need to be =
"bucketized" in reporting.
  - Requested that reporting and communication =
break out automated testing and hands-on user validation clearly, with =
specific buckets for:
    - Automated integration testing
    - Manual end-to-end/business process testing (especially in Finance, =
ISC, Commercial)
    - Payroll/ADP testing
- **Numbers Provided:** 26 out =
of 51 ERP scenarios are automated.

---

### 4. **Communication Strategy =
and Stakeholder Engagement**

#### **Strategy Overview**
- **Communication Launch:** Strategy is rolling out the same day (June 20, =
2025) with a blend of live and email-driven communications.
- **Objectives:**
  - Ensure "who, what, when, why, and how" are =
consistently communicated.
  - Set clear expectations and identify =
challenges early.
  - Prevent information gaps, with a preference for =
over-communication.
- **Tools and Logistics:**
  - Bridge lines and all =
necessary comms links/tools are in place for UAT starting next week.
  - Daily touchpoints planned (calls, emails, updates).

#### **Stakeholder Engagement**
- **VP Workshop:**=20
  - Next round of comms to business leaders and VPs, likely at next =
Wednesday=E2=80=99s (June 25, 2025) V workshop.
  - Vicky/Jennifer to =
coordinate timing and inclusion of UAT comms in agenda.

---

## Action Items

1. **Regional Tester Coverage:**=20
   - Complete identification of business testers by geography and =
sub-function, with a focus on non-North American regions (Asia, Ireland, =
plant-level).
   - Escalate gaps to respective functional leaders (Tina for=
 Finance).

2. **Test Script Finalization:**=20
   - ERP and supply chain =
scripts to be finalized by Monday (June 23, 2025).
   - Address gaps in =
Edicom/tax app regional testers=E2=80=94coordinate with Ben Goldstein, Will=
 Jay.

3. **UAT Framing and Reporting:**
   - Revise UAT status and defect =
reporting to clearly separate:
     - Automated integration tests (ERP LAS)
     - Manual, business-driven end-to-end tests (especially Finance, ISC, =
Commercial)
     - Payroll/ADP tests
   - Report must enable pinpointing =
delays/gaps by stream/test type.

4. **Early SIT/UAT Schedules:**
   - Publish granular SIT and UAT calendars for team consumption (SIT: =
today; UAT: June 23).

5. **Communication Plan Execution:**
   - Begin live and email communication today, including UAT kickoff =
notifications.
   - Prepare materials for presentation at the next VP =
Workshop on June 25, 2025.

6. **Defect Management Integration:**
   - Incorporate ADP/payroll defect reporting into overarching dashboard to=
 prevent scope gaps.

---

## Follow-up Points / Next Meetings

- **Offline Conversations:** Several team members, including Paul and Jeff,=
 to continue discussions on website team and HR topics.
- **Data on Tester Distribution:** Provide Jeff (and Tina) with data on =
current tester distribution ASAP; Jeff will advocate for regional =
participation as needed.
- **Communication with Business Leadership:** =
Ensure UAT communication and strategy are added to next Wednesday=E2=80=99s=
 VP workshop agenda.
- **Frequency of Syncs:** Maintain high meeting =
cadence as SIT/UAT begins; daily scrum calls planned from next week.

Transcript:
0:01
There we go. No, it's happened to Paul one too many times,=
 so we don't want to keep doing that.

0:07
We've seen this deck all week, =
so probably any of us could do it. Absolutely, absolutely.

0:16
You always do it with the smile on your face, though, Paul. So there's that=
.

0:20
I tried.

0:20
I don't know.

0:23
The alternative is not good.

0:24
So.

0:27
Enjoy the journey, right?

0:28
Yeah, exactly.

0:30
I think half of my calls have been with Paul this morning. Yeah, I went =
back to Paul. All good.

0:40
All right. What did you leave? Was he still =
on the call when you hung up?

0:44
He was, but he saw that I dropped, so =
he knows he needs to get here.

0:49
Okay.

0:53
I can ping him real quick.

0:55
Yeah, that'd be great.

0:56
Let's all pay him at the same time.

0:59
I was literally about to offer that an HR thing I needed to talk to =
him about, so he was very aware.

1:06
He's coming, he's coming.

1:07
Okay.

1:08
This is important to him.

1:10
Yeah.

1:13
Okay. There he is. Hey, Jeff, you unmute.

1:17
Unmuted it all. Unmuted me?=
 Yeah, I was on with the. With the. The website team.

1:22
Yes, yes. I'm sorry, I had to.

1:24
That's another very energetic =
conversation.

1:27
I've heard that. So I might be talking to you offline =
on that one and you a call. I am presenting with Sheila to the EDP in a =
minute, so I'm gonna have to drop. But Jeff, I've met with this team every =
single day, so we've made a lot of progress and I'm going to let them give =
you an update on what we have done thus far and then I'll connect with you =
offline.

1:45
So with that, I had a couple questions too, guys. Just ping =
me later.

1:51
Yeah, I'll ping you when I'm in the car. Perfect, guys, =
talk to you later.

1:54
Thanks. Okay, Jeff. All right, so again, we'll =
talk through these couple of salient points on each slide. We'll walk you =
through what we've done to date and how we're tracking to it. And then of =
course, you know, follow ups and any questions, we'll talk through each of =
these. So we'll walk through the readiness summary, review the. The testing=
 calendar we have to date and talk you through that, review the trackers we=
 have and the dashboards, walk you through that. And then the communication=
 strategy and plan that Vicky will walk us through. So with that, Jeff, =
overall status, I think yeoman's effort really, since our last conversation=
 on Friday, quite a bit of heavy lifting. You mostly in terms of =
coordinating all of the data and information we have and packaging it well.=
 So success story thus far we've identified the critical apps and the =
adjacent apps that need to be tested as part of the end to end process and =
UAT testing. We've got close to 200 business testers across all of these =
sub function and process areas. Almost 198 unique business testers. So some=
 of them are doing a couple of more things, but really about 98 unique =
business testers across 20 sub functions. And to date we've got 139 test =
scripts. We have a couple of more areas where we are finalizing the test =
scripts and we'll walk you through those. Those are today and Monday. We'll=
 walk you through those areas.

3:25
So for the testers, one of the things =
that I would like to know is like what number, what percentage of those =
testers are in the parameter.

3:36
Okay.

3:39
We'Re gonna have to do a =
little more work on that. We have started taking some of that information =
down because I do see that as a risk. But we will work through that today =
into Monday and get that answer.

3:50
Yeah, I mean either my question. UAT=
 is also knowledge transfer. Right. And yeah, so, so, so let's, let's see =
where we are. And then, you know, the, I, I may add an ask. I will likely =
add an ask which would be for those business testers to identify somebody =
in the perimeter who can, you know, can go along with them to make sure =
that we're getting some Solstice eyes on this because they're the ones that=
 are going to be need to live with this.

4:26
Yeah, we got that from a few=
 people. I think the biggest function we're going to have some struggles =
with that on is finance just being.

4:33
No, I know, I know. But then, but=
 then if that's the case and we have a real gap, then that becomes a follow=
 up. Will Jack and Tina to say, do you want to bring some people in from =
the plant to put this forward? You know, I met a new senior financial =
analyst in Dublin, you know, two days ago. That's, that's just joined. Hey,=
 right. We don't need to be locked in North America. It's pulling some =
folks from Asia, pulling some folks from Ireland. They're, they're anxious =
to get involved. So I, I do want, I went for each of the, each, each of the=
, the critical apps. I want there to be, you know, some participation of =
Solstice employees. So if it's all Honeywell, all corporate like then we =
got more work to do and I want to put more on the central team. I'll Ask =
the functional leaders to go figure that out. Okay, thank you. Back to you.

5:34
Yeah, no, we'll take that certainly. And I think there are a few =
cases you'll see that, that we have encountered that where they are =
providing brand new joiners and so on the one end we identify it as a risk =
that KT needs to happen, but on the flip side, the point you're making is =
valid and we'll track that and get back to you. So overall then we've got =
detailed testing calendar. We're socializing that today for SIT and then =
UAT early next week. We've got the communication strategy, we're starting =
that today. And as well as the mos for SIT and uat, the execution of that =
will start on Monday with the daily scrum calls early next week. We'll also=
 look at all of the logistics finalization for Morse planes and work =
through all of the communication for that. And then finally the status =
reporting, we'll talk through the execution tracking as well as the defect =
management. So you've seen this calendar, a version of this we showed and =
socialized. I think the key takeaways here are that, you know, there's been=
 quite a few channels of conversations around can we start UAT early, at =
least in the regions. And what we've discussed with all of the application =
owners and the the IT function leads as well is where is that possible? =
Once SIT is over, there's going to be a handoff between the teams and the =
regional testing teams on what applications are really ready to start =
testing and what capability or what process areas and sub functions whose =
scripts they can run to start testing around the 7.2 time frame. So that =
still needs to be fleshed out a little bit. But I think that's the plan =
that there will be a handoff and where ready in each region to the point =
you made earlier. We'll pull in those regional testers and coordinate =
testing there for those areas that are ready.

7:42
What is the difference between UAT1 and UAT2? Is it a different set of apps=
 or is it just the second part of the apples for. So you're going to do =
UAT1, you're going to identify issues, you're going to fix them and then =
we're going to come back and confirm that UAT2 that those things are fixed =
or is UAT1 and UAT2 different apps?

8:05
Jessica, do you want to.

8:06
Yeah, I can take that. It's all the same apps, but a lot of the scripts =
they're going to test UAT one week and Then there's a couple components =
that are more business user focused. Like for example things Hyperion. =
There's some reports that they have to print out. So it's going to be the =
maybe 80%. This is rough numbers right now. 80% happening the week of UAT1 =
and then the week of UAT2 is the remaining 20ish percent slash any =
additional defect fixing. So they're going to do whatever they can remote =
but if there's something they need the end testers to hit a button or =
validate that the SDS printing out. That's what's going to happen the week =
during UAT2.

8:49
Okay, got it, thank you.

8:53
And so we do have a =
detailed calendar here and what you see is a daily calendar or this is more=
 a week on week but we do have a much more one double click into this =
further that we'll publish for SIT today and then UAT Monday.

9:12
Monday.

9:15
So overall in terms of the critical systems I think the key call out =
here is a couple of areas and you will see this in the BRV adjacent as well=
. So we're tracking well to everything in terms of the SIT and UAT testers =
named. There are a couple of areas where we're finalizing the test scripts =
I think for the ERP and supply chain today and then a couple of these into =
Monday. The one area I'd like to to note here is it alludes to the point of=
 having SolSystem for Edicom and some of the tax applications, particularly=
 what Jessica mentioned on the finance space. We've escalated that to Ben =
Goldstein. We're having conversations with Will Jay on identifying UAT =
testers in region because you know, for Edicom and some of the other tax =
apps that need testing in Romania, Germany, Mexico and the like, we need =
sources, regional testers there. And so the org isn't ready yet and names =
haven't, you know, there aren't people in seats. So that's something we're =
chasing.

10:16
But we have all the leaders and we can go ahead and get =
those things. So if you need any help. I was just with Ben in, in Ireland. =
So like I gotta you just like literally Wednesday night. Right. So couldn't=
 just talk with him then. But I will, you know I will make the point =
through Tina and Tina will drive it down for finance organization that =
finance is a big build back function. This is knowledge transfer. Plus you =
guys need to make sure that it's going to work and then we'll get that =
sorted. But so give me that data sooner rather than later around, you know,=
 the testers and where we need more solstice testers and I'll go work that.

11:00
Yeah, we'll get that today. But Jeff, kind of to that point it would=
 definitely be I think at this point helpful for you to whether it's an =
email or a conversation, when you see them, keep having those conversations=
 with these folks because one of the things that for at least me was =
discoverable this week is that some of these folks really didn't have as =
much information and knowledge on this. So just whenever you can share that=
 messaging.

11:25
Yep. Well then, okay.

11:27
Hey, question on like space=
 and Hyperion. So I know there's this one, you know the, for the =
consolidation. So this is the UAT testing pre August 1st is really going to=
 be around the legal entity changes. And then Rakesh, keep me honest here. =
The plan is then to kind of clone that into the solstice environment and =
that's where once the data starts flowing post 81, that's where they'll do =
the like mock close.

11:52
Correct, correct, correct. This is existing =
environment.

11:56
Okay. Okay.

11:59
And we do know that's later in the =
schedule. So we do need that up that upstream data to make Hyperion =
relevant. So.

12:06
Yeah. Okay. So kind of for them they've got sort of =
the, you know, simulation testing with the mock closes. This is kind of, =
for lack of a better word, sort of regression testing a bit. Is that a good=
 way to think about it?

12:19
Yeah, I would say so. Yeah, sure. And then =
similarly we've got a couple of slides in the readiness in terms of the all=
 the adjacent systems. So all the testers named, you know, they're using =
the existing access and the existing QA systems where possible. So that's =
all aligned and some of these are the ones that blacked out really are you =
know, workflows or tools that really don't have environment landscape and =
so they're not relevant for the this. So we've aligned all the schedule as =
well. The call out here again is on that tax application similarly to the =
ETICOM space. We've already spoken about it. That's the one area we need to=
 close the gap on coming into then the execution status. So what we'll do =
here Jeff, is every day, morning and evening end of day we will be =
publishing this report out on the total scripts. What is planned for the =
day, what's actually completed, what is delayed, what is at risk of not =
completing, what is delayed either due to defects or non approvals. And =
this is how we're going to track it and report out to UN leadership twice a=
 day, once in the morning on the plan and then end of day as a roundup of =
the activities completed.

13:40
So who will raise defects or script =
failures? How will that. I also there was some conversation that this was =
going to be automated with an AI tool and what the UAT business testers =
were really doing, validation of the end product, but not so much the =
validation of the individual steps. So help me understand day in the life =
of, you know, trade compliance. Six scripts. Somebody's doing trade =
compliance, somebody in the business. What are they doing? What are they =
seeing? How do we, how are we going to reflect their input? What does that =
look like?

14:28
Yeah, and Bill, are you on?

14:32
Yep, I'm here.

14:34
Do you want to.

14:35
Yeah. So we are using automation for a large =
percentage of the scripts that need to produce outputs with the new =
Solstice legal entity information. And it'll require less touches for =
keyboards for users and. But if anything fails along the way, you know, =
we'll track that, see if it's an integration point we'll. Or if there was =
an issue in SAP, an access issue, think of any number of things that caused=
 the failure, we remediate those and run again. But we also have scripts =
for the users to run sort of as you said in the day in their life. I'm =
creating a sales order for a customer and then I send it down for pick, =
pack and ship. And once we go that order to cash scenario all the way =
through. No processes are changing as part of this deployment, but the =
integration points are all being changed so that the Solstice AM business =
is its own space on CIP 900 no longer connected out to any other systems in=
 Honeywell and vice versa. The ones that were connected to CIP 900 being =
removed. So we have to check all of those 76 integration points that prior =
had shared information pathways that we've now bifurcated and let UOP have =
theirs, for instance, and Solstice has theirs. So that's kind of the way it=
 goes. We normally could turn around a fix pretty quickly unless it's a =
development issue, but we don't, we didn't do a lot of development on this =
other than the forms.

16:04
It might be helpful to kind of frame at the =
start of this. You know, again, back to my comment on what, what's, what's =
changing and therefore what's driving the testing. Right. So what's =
changing is there's some logical separation that's happening within the erp=
. So what, what we need to test there is we need to test all the =
integrations, how are we testing them? We're actually going to do it in =
automated testing is kind of, that's what I'm hearing. Right. The other =
thing that's changing is the legal entities are going live, assets and =
liabilities are being moved, employees are getting moved. So. And we got a =
new payroll provider. All right, so ADP is going to be tested, but you got =
to bring, we need to bring that into this MOS in terms of, you know, where,=
 where are we on the ADP testing? Right. Because otherwise we've got a =
blind spot in our conversation. So that's got to come in. I know HRIS is =
kind of doing it, it's more of a service. Then let's like we got to bring =
that into the same conversation. Okay, so, so that's how that one's going =
to happen. There's, you know, then there's, we have three people in new =
roles. So they're going to be tested through some end to end product =
scripts or end to end scripts that are kind of day in the line which are =
end to end processes that they're going to go and execute queue and then =
anything else we want to lay out there. But I think kind of framing that up=
 because I mean UATs are compassing a lot like some stuff that, that we're =
saying is UAT feels more like regression testing to me than UAT because if =
it's a user, they're not touching the keyboard. It doesn't feel like a user=
 acceptance test. It feels like maybe they're, they're giving some =
validation of data validation on the outputs. But I just think getting that=
 clear because there's a lot going here with 50 some apps and 98 testers =
and you know, all of these kind of pieces together. So some framing up =
front run how that's going to work. Except that that should also reflect in=
 the way that we, we come back with and validate the full report out on the=
 results. It's like, well, Jeff, remember, you know, we're doing the =
logical separation and the impact there is that we see 76 integrations. =
We're testing those with this automated testing app. We've completed, you =
know, 73 of them, three of them had defects. We're fixing those, we expect =
to get them back up and testing again. So we talk that in a bucket and then=
 we talk the end to end processes in a bucket and then we talk ADP in a =
bucket. Like let's bucketize this a little bit because I think if we try to=
 do it all with the same lens it's going to get confusing. Understood. Just=
, just. I mean you guys are closer to it but I just would offer that =
perspective based on, based on what I hear you and, and Bill. I, I was in =
the LAS workshop with Bill so I heard some of this, you know more detail =
last week. But let's just think about what's the best way to find me this =
and help to explain because in my view, you know we're testing the focus on=
 testing the things that are changing and then essentially validating the =
things that aren't changing. Still work with regression testing or some =
other types of automated testing.

19:36
No good points. I mean we need to =
have it. If everything on this page looks good and ADP is not here, we'll =
get ourselves in trouble.

19:44
Right. So we need, I mean the most =
important thing is that people are going to get paid right? I mean you want=
 hyper care issues Paul, that's where you'll have a lot of hyper care =
issues if people don't get their checks right. And it's going to be a =
little, it's going to be a little wonky too because you know, I mean this =
is more like change management stuff but people are going to get two W2s =
the going to get their ficus going to renew so there's almost like unknown =
issues thing a change communication thing that we need to have like you =
know F is going to start back up is essentially third just as if you. Well =
not on 8:1 but on 11:1 you know so it's, it'll be more condition for the =
new company to manage but you, you'll have those things as well. Okay, what=
 else did you want to.

20:34
Yeah so I think the other point is the defect=
 management dashboard again this I think the point you're making on ADP =
will have to incorporate the reports from them as well but again this, this=
 talks to the point on you know run these scripts with these are past. =
These are the open issues and across these four severities and actually =
double clicking into that to say across these end to end process areas or =
across these work streams. This is, these are the, the breakouts of that =
and how.

21:03
So the thing that's still not super clear to me is how much=
 of this is you're going to run this kind of AI automated testing and =
you're going to ask the business users to validate the output versus where =
the users are going to be hands on keys working through it and test break =
and for me those are, those are a bit of Apple's norm just Conversations =
because the former, the first one is essentially it's an extended sib =
because you're getting some validation of the business eyes on the output. =
The output makes sense and maybe that's where you get into some of these =
reporting and other things associated with that. But it really feels more =
like an extended sip. And what I think about more as UAT is the send in =
process mapping. So I'll just leave you with that diversion thought as you =
guys think about how you want to present this to Suhai and myself in a way =
that's kind of clear of the action because on the first one, other than =
there is a defect with the result, you're not going to expect that the end =
users are going to go in the snow and raise a bunch of defects on the end =
to end stuff. Are we expecting that the users are going to go in the cell =
and raise their own defects or are they going to send an email to their IT =
partner? Or there's going to be. So it's a sales sheet or.

22:27
Yeah, so. So on that. So on that point, Jeff. So the portion of ERP =
majority of that will be on in Tosca. So the execution, the automation and =
the scripts there, the 51 or so odd scripts within the ERP port that deals =
with most of supply chain and ordered cash, all of those. And Bill, you can=
 add color to this here. So those are all going to be automated and in =
Tosca. And so the defect management tracking will also be in tosca. So we =
will get reports out of there that track all of that. The finance portion =
of it is to the point you just made earlier, it's all manual. So it is =
actually people on keyboard, right, running the end to end scenarios and =
the functional scenarios and scripts and capturing that. So this =
essentially then becomes an aggregated view of it. And to your point, we =
will take that back.

23:25
I think you're mixing apples and oranges in =
this basket. I would just, rather than say overall I would bifurcate this =
and maybe it's really, really we're doing three UAPs, we're doing a, a =
largely automated UAT on the ERP LAS piece. We're doing a heavily finance =
focus, but not just finance because I'm sure there's got to be some ISC and=
 commercial folks in there, right? Doing more end to end, end to end =
process testing and then we're doing adp. And maybe that's not the right =
way to break. I think you guys got to come in. But I wouldn't combine =
apples and oranges into like 104 r ch because it's not going to drive the =
action. Right. Because my first question is going to be, you're going to be=
 like, oh, we're, you know, we're 30% behind. And I'm going to be like, =
well, where are we behind? Like, oh, well, you know, all the automated =
testing is done, the finance is behind. Well, then I'm just going to go be =
on finance. Right. So are they just bifurcating and from the beginning, =
because it is very much Apple Stores between automated testing and where =
you actually got. People have to go in, they got login hands on keys, they =
got to process through all that. I'm not going to be prescriptive on that. =
It's just my point of view. I'd ask you guys to think about that. What's =
going to be the best way to communicate this.

24:51
Noted. So we'll take that action, idea them and.

24:55
Come back to you with that.

24:57
Okay.

24:59
26 of the 51 scenarios are =
automated. Just as if you want a specific number.

25:05
Yeah.

25:06
Okay, so. And then we'll turn it over to you, Vicky, to talk through our =
communication strategy and plan and how we're kicking that off.

25:17
Okay. And I'm going to try and do the. This in a:30 so we can still end on =
time because I know everybody has a meeting to get to. Jeff, this is really=
 just a strategy overlook. We have a detailed plan behind each one of this.

25:31
This is just to let you know.

25:32
That we have a holistic view of=
 what we're doing. Our communication is actually, as mentioned earlier, is =
actually going to start today. We are having live sessions as well as email=
 going out. In terms of the kickoff for the uat, we've got bridge lines and=
 everything set up for next week in terms of moving forward for =
communication. So everybody's on track. This was, this strategy is intended=
 to make sure that everybody knows who, what, when, why and how and what =
the purpose is so that all expectations are set up front, we can identify =
any challenges that we have moving forward. Wanted to also make sure that =
they had any tools, any links and everything that specifically necessary =
for us to have a successful UAT process. So this is the overall strategy of=
.

26:19
When are you going to share this? Like either an offset or are we =
going to share it in the V workshop on Wednesday? When, when are we going =
to walk the VPs through this?

26:30
We can just tell us what date we'll be=
 there exactly.

26:36
The next window is really in the, in the plenary or,=
 or, you know, I mean, Jennifer, I'll let you figure out where you want to =
sign in.

26:43
Yeah, but we should include it in the.

26:46
We have UAT on the Wednesday call.

26:48
So we can add this to it.

26:50
Yeah, yeah.

26:52
The next slide, just to give you a quick overview, is =
that we do have a process identified for our calls, our emails, what we're =
going to include, timing, daily funds, etc.

27:02
Etc.

27:02
So just wanted to let you know that all of these details are identified. =
We're putting things in place to move us forward to ensure that everybody =
stays aligned. And I want to over communicate, not under communicate. I =
want them to say I heard so much about it that I'm sick of it, rather than =
saying I've never heard about it at all. So if they don't want, they don't =
want to like me because they hurt too much of me. I'm all good with that. =
That's what I want.

27:28
All right, guys, this looks a lot, a lot better.=
 Christina, Mickey, Jessica, thanks for, you know, agreeing to be deputized=
, stepping in to, to get this sorted. So I appreciate that this is really =
important. All right, guys, thanks. Let's keep up this, keep up this =
frequency as we get into the next few weeks there. All right, everyone, =
have a great weekend. That it.

All right, so again, we&#x27;ll talk through these couple of salient points=
 on each slide. We&#x27;ll walk you through what we&#x27;ve done to date =
and how we&#x27;re tracking to it. And then of course, you know, follow ups=
 and any questions, we&#x27;ll talk through each of these. So we&#x27;ll =
walk through the readiness summary, review the. The testing calendar we =
have to date and talk you through that, review the trackers we have and the=
 dashboards, walk you through that. And then the communication strategy and=
 plan that Vicky will walk us through. So with that, Jeff, overall status, =
I think yeoman&#x27;s effort really, since our last conversation on Friday,=
 quite a bit of heavy lifting. You mostly in terms of coordinating all of =
the data and information we have and packaging it well. So success story =
thus far we&#x27;ve identified the critical apps and the adjacent apps that=
 need to be tested as part of the end to end process and UAT testing. =
We&#x27;ve got close to 200 business testers across all of these sub =
function and process areas. Almost 198 unique business testers. So some of =
them are doing a couple of more things, but really about 98 unique business=
 testers across 20 sub functions. And to date we&#x27;ve got 139 test =
scripts. We have a couple of more areas where we are finalizing the test =
scripts and we&#x27;ll walk you through those. Those are today and Monday. =
We&#x27;ll walk you through those areas.</div></div><div =

for those business testers to identify somebody in the perimeter who can, =

6">No, I know, I know. But then, but then if that&#x27;s the case and we =
have a real gap, then that becomes a follow up. Will Jack and Tina to say, =
do you want to bring some people in from the plant to put this forward? You=
 know, I met a new senior financial analyst in Dublin, you know, two days =
ago. That&#x27;s, that&#x27;s just joined. Hey, right. We don&#x27;t need =
to be locked in North America. It&#x27;s pulling some folks from Asia, =
pulling some folks from Ireland. They&#x27;re, they&#x27;re anxious to get =
involved. So I, I do want, I went for each of the, each, each of the, the =
critical apps. I want there to be, you know, some participation of Solstice=
 employees. So if it&#x27;s all Honeywell, all corporate like then we got =
more work to do and I want to put more on the central team. I&#x27;ll Ask =
the functional leaders to go figure that out. Okay, thank you. Back to you.=

that, that we have encountered that where they are providing brand new =
joiners and so on the one end we identify it as a risk that KT needs to =
happen, but on the flip side, the point you&#x27;re making is valid and =
we&#x27;ll track that and get back to you. So overall then we&#x27;ve got =
detailed testing calendar. We&#x27;re socializing that today for SIT and =
then UAT early next week. We&#x27;ve got the communication strategy, =
we&#x27;re starting that today. And as well as the mos for SIT and uat, the=
 execution of that will start on Monday with the daily scrum calls early =
next week. We&#x27;ll also look at all of the logistics finalization for =
Morse planes and work through all of the communication for that. And then =
finally the status reporting, we&#x27;ll talk through the execution =
tracking as well as the defect management. So you&#x27;ve seen this =
calendar, a version of this we showed and socialized. I think the key =
takeaways here are that, you know, there&#x27;s been quite a few channels =
of conversations around can we start UAT early, at least in the regions. =
And what we&#x27;ve discussed with all of the application owners and the =
the IT function leads as well is where is that possible? Once SIT is over, =
there&#x27;s going to be a handoff between the teams and the regional =
testing teams on what applications are really ready to start testing and =
what capability or what process areas and sub functions whose scripts they =
can run to start testing around the 7.2 time frame. So that still needs to =
be fleshed out a little bit. But I think that&#x27;s the plan that there =
will be a handoff and where ready in each region to the point you made =
earlier. We&#x27;ll pull in those regional testers and coordinate testing =
there for those areas that are ready.</div></div><div =

Goldstein. We&#x27;re having conversations with Will Jay on identifying UAT=

using automation for a large percentage of the scripts that need to produce=
 outputs with the new Solstice legal entity information. And it&#x27;ll =
require less touches for keyboards for users and. But if anything fails =
along the way, you know, we&#x27;ll track that, see if it&#x27;s an =
integration point we&#x27;ll. Or if there was an issue in SAP, an access =
issue, think of any number of things that caused the failure, we remediate =
those and run again. But we also have scripts for the users to run sort of =
as you said in the day in their life. I&#x27;m creating a sales order for a=
 customer and then I send it down for pick, pack and ship. And once we go =
that order to cash scenario all the way through. No processes are changing =
as part of this deployment, but the integration points are all being =
changed so that the Solstice AM business is its own space on CIP 900 no =
longer connected out to any other systems in Honeywell and vice versa. The =
ones that were connected to CIP 900 being removed. So we have to check all =
of those 76 integration points that prior had shared information pathways =
that we&#x27;ve now bifurcated and let UOP have theirs, for instance, and =
Solstice has theirs. So that&#x27;s kind of the way it goes. We normally =
could turn around a fix pretty quickly unless it&#x27;s a development issue=

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">It might be helpful =
to kind of frame at the start of this. You know, again, back to my comment =
on what, what&#x27;s, what&#x27;s changing and therefore what&#x27;s =
driving the testing. Right. So what&#x27;s changing is there&#x27;s some =
logical separation that&#x27;s happening within the erp. So what, what we =
need to test there is we need to test all the integrations, how are we =
testing them? We&#x27;re actually going to do it in automated testing is =
kind of, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hearing. Right. The other thing =
that&#x27;s changing is the legal entities are going live, assets and =
liabilities are being moved, employees are getting moved. So. And we got a =
new payroll provider. All right, so ADP is going to be tested, but you got =
to bring, we need to bring that into this MOS in terms of, you know, where,=
 where are we on the ADP testing? Right. Because otherwise we&#x27;ve got a=
 blind spot in our conversation. So that&#x27;s got to come in. I know HRIS=
 is kind of doing it, it&#x27;s more of a service. Then let&#x27;s like we =
got to bring that into the same conversation. Okay, so, so that&#x27;s how =
that one&#x27;s going to happen. There&#x27;s, you know, then there&#x27;s,=
 we have three people in new roles. So they&#x27;re going to be tested =
through some end to end product scripts or end to end scripts that are kind=
 of day in the line which are end to end processes that they&#x27;re going =
to go and execute queue and then anything else we want to lay out there. =
But I think kind of framing that up because I mean UATs are compassing a =
lot like some stuff that, that we&#x27;re saying is UAT feels more like =
regression testing to me than UAT because if it&#x27;s a user, they&#x27;re=
 not touching the keyboard. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a user acceptance =
test. It feels like maybe they&#x27;re, they&#x27;re giving some validation=
 of data validation on the outputs. But I just think getting that clear =
because there&#x27;s a lot going here with 50 some apps and 98 testers and =
you know, all of these kind of pieces together. So some framing up front =
run how that&#x27;s going to work. Except that that should also reflect in =
the way that we, we come back with and validate the full report out on the =
results. It&#x27;s like, well, Jeff, remember, you know, we&#x27;re doing =
the logical separation and the impact there is that we see 76 integrations.=
 We&#x27;re testing those with this automated testing app. We&#x27;ve =
completed, you know, 73 of them, three of them had defects. We&#x27;re =
fixing those, we expect to get them back up and testing again. So we talk =
that in a bucket and then we talk the end to end processes in a bucket and =
then we talk ADP in a bucket. Like let&#x27;s bucketize this a little bit =
because I think if we try to do it all with the same lens it&#x27;s going =
to get confusing. Understood. Just, just. I mean you guys are closer to it =
but I just would offer that perspective based on, based on what I hear you =
and, and Bill. I, I was in the LAS workshop with Bill so I heard some of =
this, you know more detail last week. But let&#x27;s just think about =
what&#x27;s the best way to find me this and help to explain because in my =
view, you know we&#x27;re testing the focus on testing the things that are =
changing and then essentially validating the things that aren&#x27;t =
changing. Still work with regression testing or some other types of =
automated testing.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px=

that&#x27;s still not super clear to me is how much of this is you&#x27;re =
going to run this kind of AI automated testing and you&#x27;re going to ask=
 the business users to validate the output versus where the users are going=
 to be hands on keys working through it and test break and for me those are=

former, the first one is essentially it&#x27;s an extended sib because =
you&#x27;re getting some validation of the business eyes on the output. The=
 output makes sense and maybe that&#x27;s where you get into some of these =
reporting and other things associated with that. But it really feels more =
like an extended sip. And what I think about more as UAT is the send in =
process mapping. So I&#x27;ll just leave you with that diversion thought as=
 you guys think about how you want to present this to Suhai and myself in a=
 way that&#x27;s kind of clear of the action because on the first one, =
other than there is a defect with the result, you&#x27;re not going to =
expect that the end users are going to go in the snow and raise a bunch of =
defects on the end to end stuff. Are we expecting that the users are going =
to go in the cell and raise their own defects or are they going to send an =
