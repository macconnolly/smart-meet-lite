Meeting Summary

*Date:* June 12, 2025
*Attendees:* Rakesh, Mac, Justin (joined mid-way), references to Jeff,
Paul, Pierce, Sriram, Audrey, Srinivas, Gokul, and Harry
*Main Focus:* Preparing consolidated SIT/UAT status, defects, and
look-ahead dashboard/reporting for applications in advance of a critical
call with Jeff and team on June 13, 2025 (10:30 Eastern).
------------------------------
Attendee Introductions and Context

   - Rakesh opened the meeting, emphasizing the urgency of compiling
   multiple data points and dashboards to support a request (from Jeff) due
   the next day.
   - The objective is to produce a comprehensive SIT and UAT status
   overview, both overall and by application, including defect tracking and=
 a
   30-day UAT look ahead.

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *Dashboard and Reporting Requirements*a. SIT and
UAT Status

   - Immediate need for overall SIT status and by application.
   - UAT status also required, even if some data are incomplete (noted that
   for most applications, UAT has not started).
   - The team acknowledged gaps in UAT status data. Many applications
   haven=E2=80=99t started UAT; SIT completion info is also scattered.

b. Data Sources and Challenges

   - Multiple trackers exist (e.g., =E2=80=9Csystems tracker,=E2=80=9D Smar=
tsheet, Excel
   spreadsheets, and files from Audrey and Sriram).
   - Existing trackers are often incomplete or inconsistent (e.g., missing
   system IDs or mapping issues between system names and IDs).
   - Data about SIT completion is partial; much is based on anecdotal
   comments from recent calls.
   - Some files received only recently (access granted on the morning of
   June 12), further adding to the challenge.
   - There is a need to reconcile application names and IDs for dashboard
   purposes, even if Jeff=E2=80=99s team is less concerned with IDs.

c. Defect Tracking

   - Key requirement: For each application, provide number of defects by
   type/category (four categories called out, e.g., SEP 1-4).
   - Rakesh suggested adding columns to existing trackers for defect counts
   and types.
   - Query about the possibility of leveraging defect tracking data from
   Jira, if available.

d. UAT 30-Day Look Ahead

   - Jeff requested a 30-day look ahead for UAT: indicating which apps are
   starting UAT, projected dates, teams in place, and readiness.
   - Discussion about the best format for this (tabular vs. Gantt view).
   - Suggestion to leverage existing =E2=80=9Cgo-live=E2=80=9D or planning =
calendars
   (referenced kickoff decks, historic tables, and even a "heat map" type o=
f
   tracker).

e. Output Formats and Tools

   - For the immediate delivery (June 13), Rakesh prioritized a simple
   Excel summary (due to Smartsheet licensing/access issues).
   - Pivot tables and summary charts suggested for clarity.
   - The presented data must be sufficient for Jeff to understand and react
   to, but doesn=E2=80=99t need to be final/perfect. Future enhancements ca=
n move to
   Smartsheet or Capital Edge dashboards, and eventually Power BI.

2. *Responsibilities and Coordination*a. Data Collection and Cleanup

   - Mac was asked to focus the day on cleaning up the data and pulling
   together as much available information as possible into a reporting form=
at.
   - Justin was assigned to start structuring summary tables/views based on
   the best available data.
   - Rakesh agreed to consolidate information from various sources and push
   to refine open data points: especially key dates, defect counts, and
   application readiness.

b. Reaching Out for Data Gaps

   - Key risk: lack of up-to-date or complete data on certain applications.
   - Specific action to connect with Srinivas (Srinivas D) for up-to-date
   defect tracking (potentially via Jira) and to clarify how best to displa=
y
   defect data.
   - Also agreed to reach out to Gokul and Harry Tong, as well as reference
   materials received by Audrey, Sriram, and Pierce for additional detail.

c. Meeting Coordination

   - Follow-up call scheduled with Paul at 10:30 Eastern the same day (June
   12).
   - Functional alignment call with HR team at 11:00 AM.
   - The primary target is to have a draft dashboard/report ready for
   Jeff=E2=80=99s call on June 13 at 10:30 or 10:00 Eastern (uncertainty ov=
er exact
   time; agenda not yet distributed).

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Compile SIT and UAT Status (by Application and Overall):*
   - Mac to consolidate available systems data into a cleaned reporting
      file (Excel), leveraging multiple trackers and manually
reconciling system
      names/IDs as needed.
      - Rakesh to consolidate data from functional calls and existing
      trackers for as many applications as possible.
   2.

   *Defect Data:*
   - Mac or Justin to create fields/columns for defect number and category
      in the tracker.
      - Connect with Srinivas to clarify defect tracking process=E2=80=94es=
pecially
      from Jira=E2=80=94and request a report/export if available.
      - Rakesh to forward summary requirements (Jeff/Paul=E2=80=99s bullet =
points)
      to Srinivas and request best path forward for defect and readiness da=
ta.
   3.

   *30-Day UAT Look Ahead:*
   - Create a summary (preferably both table and Gantt-view) showing UAT
      planned start dates for all applications.
      - Mark applications with confirmed testing teams assigned/readiness
      where available.
      - Rakesh to search historical kickoff/presentation decks for suitable
      view as a starting point/template.
   4.

   *Coordinate with Additional Stakeholders:*
   - Reach out to Gokul and Harry Tong for insights into defect tracking
      and start/end date management.
      - Reference and incorporate material from Audrey (already tracking
      some key data).
      - Confirm who outside current call is maintaining =E2=80=9Cheat map=
=E2=80=9D style
      visual trackers.
   5.

   *Dashboard Construction & Delivery:*
   - Justin to take initial pass at constructing summary tables and basic
      dashboard in Excel.
      - Ensure output allows for both summary and application-level =E2=80=
=9Cdrill
      down=E2=80=9D.
      - Prepare to deliver at least draft table/pivot/chart views for Jeff
      by June 13.
   6.

   *Meetings & Follow-ups:*
   - Paul call confirmed for 10:30 Eastern on June 12 (Rakesh will attend).
      - 11:00 AM HR alignment call to continue data
      collection/reconciliation.
      - Prepare for Friday=E2=80=99s (June 13) meeting with Jeff and team
      (10:00=E2=80=9310:30 Eastern).

------------------------------
Follow-up Points

   - *Paul Call:* Rakesh to discuss risks and reporting approach with Paul
   at 10:30 Eastern, June 12.
   - *Srinivas Contact:* Immediate follow-up for defect and status data;
   subsequent clarification or data pulls as required.
   - *Data Gathering:* Ongoing effort through the rest of June 12 to
   consolidate, clean, and fill gaps; additional follow-ups might be schedu=
led
   if data remains incomplete.
   - *Jeff Meeting:* Ensure all key output (status table, defect summary,
   UAT look ahead) is ready by morning of June 13.
   - *Transition to Dynamic Reporting:* Once static Excel summary is
   accepted, roadmap to transition reporting to Smartsheet, Capital Edge, o=
r
   Power BI to begin.

------------------------------
Other Notes

   - The team is encouraged not to delay waiting for =E2=80=9Cperfection=E2=
=80=9D=E2=80=94all
   progress and clarity in reports are valuable ahead of Friday=E2=80=99s c=
ritical
   stakeholder review.
   - Any blockers, questions, or missing data should be flagged up quickly
   for escalation or stakeholder outreach.
   - All team members should be ready to adjust approach as new data comes
   in or if priority shifts during Paul or Jeff=E2=80=99s feedback sessions=
.

Justin3:15
Hey, Rakesh.
Mac3:17
Hey.
Justin3:18
Hey.
Mac3:19
All right, so there's a lot there. So we need to get a lot of it going. And
this is why I was insisting on this dashboard. So. All right, let's open
up. So you tell me where we are with this stuff, because I need you to get
me all this stuff today. So where are we. So status. Where would I be able
to get the SIT status overall and by application? Forget the Capital Edge
dashboard. How can we roll the marble and get this in a report on a
dashboard?
Justin3:49
Get it from the. Let me send you the link. The systems tracker. Okay, it's
on. Let me send you the link. It's in the.
Mac4:02
Okay.
Justin4:03
Honeywell side.
Mac4:11
Hey, Justin. All right, thanks for getting pulled into this. So one of the
things that. So, Justin. So let me. I mean, you're seeing this email. I'm
just going to forward this. Not the link, but just the email. Well, you can
see the email anyway, so what we're looking to do for Jeff tomorrow is get
an SIT status. He says sit, but really UAT as well. But a status overall
and by application. So where. And you are going to send me the link to it.
So I want to make sure that from Smartsheets, if we have an app inventory
plan, that we can pull the SIT status and display it somewhere. So, Mac, I
will stop sharing. Why don't you share what you have and show us.
Justin5:31
So this is not a smartsheet yet, but this has all of the data. It's
filtered for HR right now. System name, ID, owner, KT status, KT start and
end dates, UAT status, which is largely blank, but we could calculate it.
Mac5:57
I mean, uat, we should have it. As for the applications they've given us,
we should. We should have a view into it. Right. And I'm going to give you
something that Audrey. Do you have the link to the email that Audrey sent
or not? Not. Do you have a link to the file that Audrey sent?
Justin6:21
No, I don't think so. Let me see.
Mac6:24
I. I sent you a link and hold on here for supply chain. This is a link.
Justin6:35
Oh, y. Yesterday.
Mac6:39
Yes.
Justin6:41
Yes. They gave me access to that this morning. Let me open it.
Mac6:45
Okay. Oh, this one goes back to the same key systems. Never mind. This is
this. But. So Bill has been updated by Sriram. Not this. Okay, let's see
what other link. Hold on. There was a link I gave you and I'm.
Justin7:09
There's Athens UAT readiness cracker, day one. Here, it's this one.
Mac7:13
Right, right, right.
Justin7:16
Here, I've got it.
Mac7:17
Up.
Justin7:17
Let me share my other screen.
Mac7:19
Okay. Okay, this one. So what we can do is for at least for these, we
should be able to legal entity config. Okay. So this doesn't.
Justin7:43
And again, they suffer. This suffers from the same issue as the other one
where it's missing the system.
Mac7:50
Yeah, but you don't need to. You can get the name. These are same names,
right? You can look up. You know, Black Line is Black Line. You can get an
app ID name. They don't care about app IDs. So.
Justin8:01
Yeah, but I mean, we, if we're creating a dashboard, have to care about app
IDs. Understood. I spent two hours yesterday trying to decode what these
meant, where they tracked back to Understood.
Mac8:13
So the lookups against here say legal entity config. Right? It's on the
erp. Cash app is the same. We. We have an ID for the Cash app. Fscm, we got
one Edicom and Invoicing, we got one Tax. Where we have one Wakiva, we have
it Hyperion, we've got two of them. Hyperion HFM and Hyperion Planning. The
next one below that, you've got an app ID for Blackline. You got an app ID
for Lease accelerator, you've got one for kofax. You have concur. Time and
expense. So You've got app IDs against this. You just need to look up the
names. Not literally look up, but yes. No, my point is, so for these, we
have status and these tell you are the scripts ready, are the access
confirmed? We don't have a. This is my biggest problem is there isn't and
Pierce is not here. So outside this, let's set up a call with Paul to
discuss this because I want to bring up all these risks. But outside this
and Mac, just letting you know, you may need to spend a lot of time on this
today just to clean this up or at least get it into a reporting format for
Jeff. But I want to make sure, based on your smartsheets, can we. Or the
Excel you showed me before, can we run some dashboards or any simple report
that tells them, you know, how many are completed, how many are not.
Justin9:56
Completed.
Mac9:57
With uat sit, UAT is not even starting. Right.
Justin10:07
Like the gap that we have is the data. Like the gap that we have is folks
to tell us if si. Like in a lot of the calls yesterday, maybe a couple of
the finance and a couple of the ISC apps, someone said out loud, yeah, it's
done with Sit, but I think that that's the gap. Right. So from this we
could probably tell where SIT is for these apps. This is the best data that
we have. And then for the other ones that's the gap is the. We can put
together a dashboard but we don't have the data to support it.
Mac10:48
So can we do this? This is why I know we set up the follow up call. So
let's. Can we connect with Srinivas? Can you set up a call with Srinivas or
just ping him and say include, you know, forward you know, Jeff's email
bullet points and say we're looking to get this. Can you give us a view of
this? Right. Or what would be the best way to display this? The next part
of this is getting it in your tracker and saying are there defects? Are
there no defects? Right. So at defects maybe we create a column that says
number of defects and type. Alright, so maybe it's a SEP one, SEP two, you
know, just. He called out four categories. So just call it as you know, you
know, category one, you know, one through four as a drop down. Right. So
let's see if we can get. Or if they have things like in Jira already that
they can pull reports out of, then we should start having that. So this is
where.
Justin11:54
All right, so yeah, when's the Jeff call?
Mac11:57
Say that again.
Justin11:57
When is the Jeff call?
Mac11:59
I think you have the forward, the Sukai call at whatever time tomorrow.
Justin12:03
Yeah, okay.
Mac12:07
10 Eastern, something like that. 10 30.
Justin12:09
Yeah, but I thought I saw. I'm looking for the email with that agenda,
right, like the one. That one doesn't have the agenda.
Mac12:19
No, he just. The email he just sent you has the original invite plus what
he's looking to do. There is no agenda in Sukai's meeting.
Justin12:29
Yeah, okay, I see. So I'm gonna ping these to Shrinivas.
Mac12:40
Yeah, so ping what? Ping the bullet points.
Justin12:43
Yeah, say what's the 1 through 1.
Mac12:46
Through 5 and say here's what you know, Paul and Jeff want. How can I get
this? And is there ready, is there, can I use Jira? Is there something that
you guys are using in Jira or how can I get the latest on this? Because I'd
like to start displaying some dashboards that start talking about this is
the rudimentary stuff of how many things are in sit and I'll forward this
email to you, Justin, so you get a hang of, you know what, what we're
talking about here. So essentially, you know, SIT status overall and by app
and then the number of defects across the four tiers and then a 30 day look
ahead on UAT what is starting when. So we should have a calendar view of
uat. So are we able to do something and let me.
Justin13:43
Let me see what is Shrinivas full name. I can't find him in teams.
Mac13:53
I got you.
Justin13:55
I'll send you his email. Well I see his email it says Shrinivas D. Yeah
Shriniv.
Mac14:04
So just click on his email and you'll get it. Shivas D click in here. I
don't know what his full name is. Just go. He goes by. So what I was going.
What was I going to show you in our kickoff deck under Athens BRV. Sorry
did Paul reply? Can meet at 10:30. Sorry, I do need to take. I do need to
take this call with Paul at 10:30. And so for. For the HR stuff Mac it's
very similar if you got that the sheet. Let's just go through the systems
and see if you know we've got three systems PeopleSoft, Honeywell, HCM and
ADP. So just put those three names on the list and we will and I'm going to
give that to you here. So PeopleSoft I will ICM and ADPM and ADP ADP ADP
payroll. Okay so let's just put these three as the BRV systems and then we
will have Jeff or others or you know speak to it. So similar to this it
shouldn't be an hour long call but. But I do want to show something here
BRV in one of the kickoff conversations I had. It's not the UAT approach is
it this? Where is it? Is it probably here Somewhere in here I had an
appendix like that had or either that or a graveyard slide that had a view
and I'm trying to get that view to see if we can. Okay, let's see who's
here. No, it's not that but I am looking for a view like that. Let's see if
it Is this a.
Justin16:59
View like what A view like.
Mac17:05
I'll show you again.
Justin17:06
Oh, sorry I was.
Mac17:08
No no, that's okay. So it UAT approach kickoff May 17. Let's see there are
too many of these things all name the same as well I was looking for. It's
not here as well but if you look at the oak UAT deck. Let's look at our ey
Oak might have been in here. Something like this would be you know planning
status. I think even if it's a table like this may be good enough for him.
I'm trying to see if.
Justin18:57
Ah.
Mac18:59
I'm unable to see that here Mac, but I thought I saw something in here. Oak
cut over planning. Let's see here. Hoping this slide is. This deck has some
of that, but probably not. I'm unable to show you what I'm looking at.
There was a bit of a gap view on. See if it's this. It's a bit of a Gantt
chart that showed a bit a calendar of all of the apps going live. So I'm
trying to look at that because I'm trying to address this question not to
keep you guys both on the.
Justin20:04
You're trying to address the question for Jeff.
Mac20:07
Correct this question on a 30 day look ahead for UAT, what is starting when
and is there a team in play? Are there teams in place ready for testing? We
may need to give him a Gantt view on this or say look ahead for uat at
least a table view on what is starting when. If we give a table. Let's do
this. I'm going to just brainstorm here with you both and then I'll forward
this to you. Justin and Justin, hopefully you have a bit of a bandwidth to
help us with some of this dashboard today.
Justin20:48
I think the Gant view we could start to do just from the projects. Right.
Mac20:52
Like the go live, this, this one table, overall dashboard view and also a
table view. Right. So I'm thinking on these that we get.
Justin21:23
So Justin, what we'll do is I'll start to consolidate and send you the data
that we have live and then we're going to have to use the stuff from the
smartsheet to fall back on.
Mac21:34
So can we use this from smartsheet like populate the smartsheet and then so
for let's say 82, 80, 84 apps.
Justin21:45
Sure. We, we would have a. We would have a starting point for your
smartsheet.
Mac21:53
Okay. Or Excel. What if you have an Excel for tomorrow? I'm not looking for
perfection. He just needs to be happy that we've got a dashboard view that
we can then build on on top of Smartsheets or Capital Edge later on once we
get this stuff ready. But at least for overall, can we do some sort of a
pivot table or chart that from an Excel for tomorrow for the 84. So we
would need what sit start, end and status. Status is, you know, complete,
not complete, on, in progress, something to that effect.
Justin22:40
And here, Justin, I'm gonna send you a link to the live file that we have
on the Honeywell side with a lot of that data.
Mac22:50
And then if you want by application It's a table view. So if he wants and
he likes to double click so it may be easier to generate the table view and
then do a dashboard view on top of that.
Justin23:03
Yeah, I agree.
Mac23:05
So table view of 84 apps with the right columns. It's what you're already
tracking. Set, start ending, UAT maybe kt, UAT start maybe we, you know, we
put things are in progress for most of the kt, right. And we don't have a
completion because they're in sit. We say they're in progress. We can come
back maybe later and say here's what it is for, you know, maybe some is na,
some is not, you know, risk or something. Right. And then an overall
dashboard view again tell me guys, push back on me, see if this makes
sense. It doesn't.
Justin23:58
No, it does.
Mac24:00
I want to get something out to him so he can at least we can react and say
so for defects. What I need you to do is connect with Srinivas because he's
got most of the applications in ERP on where they are tracking defects. If
JIRA can we get export we then need to talk about if not, what's the best
place by that I mean like if they automatically have, if they have some
automated thing in JIRA where they maintain the defects etc. It's just a
daily report out of JIRA that we can get. I just painted and that's
correspond to this, right? If not the 30 day look ahead what is testing?
I'm looking at this as a, again a table that says, you know how many apps
are again the table. If this same table should give us a report that we can
run on UAT coming up within, you know, some date range, does that make
sense? So use that same table because we know UAT's and coming up the stock
end and status. Hopefully 99% or 100% would say not started. But if you run
a report that says here's a UAT coming up within the next 30 days or create
a report that says give me UAT within the next 30 days, you may have a
lookup or it comes into a dashboard. Eventually we'll do this as a
dashboard, but we can at least say here's a link, you know, and if you
double click into that number it takes you into a different, you know,
again power BI will help so much in this but for now a static one that says
I've got 30 apps coming up for UAT over the next 30 days, whatever the
number is based on this.
Justin26:34
Okay, yeah, that sounds Good. So I'm going to try and get some data from
Srinivas. Justin, I just put the link to the Excel that we have in here. It
depends if you want to build in Excel or in smartsheet. Probably in Excel,
because I don't know how easy it will be to add columns to manipulate that
data for me without a license for Smartsheet. Yeah, we can run Excel. Okay.
So I think that where we could probably use your help is with taking a pass
at some of these summary views. And I'm going to go chase down some of the
data and then consolidate. We have data in various places from these
functional alignment calls that we've had, like true sit, UAT dates, et
cetera. But this is the baseline that I just sent you for what we have. And
then I'm going to start to pull in the real information for like SAT start,
satend, UAT start, UAT end status, et cetera, wherever possible, and try
and get this defect data from Srinivas. So if you can take a pass at just
summary tables, I will start to consolidate the data and try and pull some
things in. And then we can connect. We have this functional alignment with
HR at 11, and then after that we can connect and maybe just work through
it. Live and work together.

The other thing, Mac, is we may want to also reach out to Gokul and Harry
just to make some. They're aware that in fact, if you want to forward
Jeff's list and say this is what Jeff and Paul are asking or Sukhai are
asking tomorrow. Is there a way to get defects based on this?
Justin28:27
Yeah, defects. And I mean, the start and end dates, like, are they tracking
that already?
Mac28:34
Yeah, if they say that's being tracked in the. If it's not at an app level,
but it's somewhere else, then yeah, where is it?
Justin28:41
And can we get who was maintaining that? That heat map looking one that you
sent me?
Mac28:48
Audrey gave me that because Shrinivas is maintaining that.
Justin28:51
Oh, Shrinivas is. Okay.
Mac28:53
Yeah. So if you have access to that.
Justin28:55
I do. Yeah. Audrey gave it to me.
Mac28:57
Yeah. So maybe reference that with him. So.
Justin29:00
Exactly. So send it to. I. I talked to Shrinivas about that. And then
forward the email to Gokul. And who was the other person?
Mac29:10
Gokul and Harry. Tom.
Justin29:12
Yeah. Oh, Harry Tong.
Mac29:13
Yeah.
Justin29:13
Okay, so I've been pinging with Shiny Boss. He's going to help and then
I'll go Gokul and Harry Tong as well.
Mac29:20
Okay, cool. Thanks, Justin. Ping ping again. Thanks for, you know, getting
dragged in. Into this, but, yeah, nothing fancy. I think we just need to be
able to show something with him that we can start creating and making it
dynamic in the trackers. So ping me for any questions, clarifications, and
then we'll. I'd like to set up some time with Paul later this morning to
just talk through some of that, but, yeah, thank you both.
Justin29:57
Thank you so much.

>Attendees:</strong> Rakesh, Mac, Justin (joined mid-way), references to Je=
ff, Paul, Pierce, Sriram, Audrey, Srinivas, Gokul, and Harry<br><strong sty=
le=3D"font-weight:bold">Main Focus:</strong> Preparing consolidated SIT/UAT=
 status, defects, and look-ahead dashboard/reporting for applications in ad=
vance of a critical call with Jeff and team on June 13, 2025 (10:30 Eastern=
).</p>
<hr>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:2rem">Attendee Intr=
oductions and Context</h2><ul>
<li>Rakesh opened the meeting, emphasizing the urgency of compiling multipl=
e data points and dashboards to support a request (from Jeff) due the next =
day.</li>
<li>The objective is to produce a comprehensive SIT and UAT status overview=
, both overall and by application, including defect tracking and a 30-day U=
AT look ahead.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:2rem">Main Topics D=
iscussed</h2><h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75re=
m">1. <strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Dashboard and Reporting Requiremen=
ts</strong></h3><h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5=
rem">a. SIT and UAT Status</h4><ul>
<li>Immediate need for overall SIT status and by application.</li>
<li>UAT status also required, even if some data are incomplete (noted that =
for most applications, UAT has not started).</li>
<li>The team acknowledged gaps in UAT status data. Many applications haven=
=E2=80=99t started UAT; SIT completion info is also scattered.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">b. Data Sou=
rces and Challenges</h4><ul>
<li>Multiple trackers exist (e.g., =E2=80=9Csystems tracker,=E2=80=9D Smart=
sheet, Excel spreadsheets, and files from Audrey and Sriram).</li>
<li>Existing trackers are often incomplete or inconsistent (e.g., missing s=
ystem IDs or mapping issues between system names and IDs).</li>
<li>Data about SIT completion is partial; much is based on anecdotal commen=
ts from recent calls.</li>
<li>Some files received only recently (access granted on the morning of Jun=
e 12), further adding to the challenge.</li>
<li>There is a need to reconcile application names and IDs for dashboard pu=
rposes, even if Jeff=E2=80=99s team is less concerned with IDs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">c. Defect T=
racking</h4><ul>
<li>Key requirement: For each application, provide number of defects by typ=
e/category (four categories called out, e.g., SEP 1-4).</li>
<li>Rakesh suggested adding columns to existing trackers for defect counts =
and types.</li>
<li>Query about the possibility of leveraging defect tracking data from Jir=
a, if available.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">d. UAT 30-D=
ay Look Ahead</h4><ul>
<li>Jeff requested a 30-day look ahead for UAT: indicating which apps are s=
tarting UAT, projected dates, teams in place, and readiness.</li>
<li>Discussion about the best format for this (tabular vs. Gantt view).</li=
>
<li>Suggestion to leverage existing =E2=80=9Cgo-live=E2=80=9D or planning c=
alendars (referenced kickoff decks, historic tables, and even a &quot;heat =
map&quot; type of tracker).</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">e. Output F=
ormats and Tools</h4><ul>
<li>For the immediate delivery (June 13), Rakesh prioritized a simple Excel=
 summary (due to Smartsheet licensing/access issues).</li>
<li>Pivot tables and summary charts suggested for clarity.</li>
<li>The presented data must be sufficient for Jeff to understand and react =
to, but doesn=E2=80=99t need to be final/perfect. Future enhancements can m=
ove to Smartsheet or Capital Edge dashboards, and eventually Power BI.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">2. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Responsibilities and Coordination</strong></h3>=
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">a. Data Col=
lection and Cleanup</h4><ul>
<li>Mac was asked to focus the day on cleaning up the data and pulling toge=
ther as much available information as possible into a reporting format.</li=
>
<li>Justin was assigned to start structuring summary tables/views based on =
the best available data.</li>
<li>Rakesh agreed to consolidate information from various sources and push =
to refine open data points: especially key dates, defect counts, and applic=
ation readiness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">b. Reaching=
 Out for Data Gaps</h4><ul>
<li>Key risk: lack of up-to-date or complete data on certain applications.<=
/li>
<li>Specific action to connect with Srinivas (Srinivas D) for up-to-date de=
fect tracking (potentially via Jira) and to clarify how best to display def=
ect data.</li>
<li>Also agreed to reach out to Gokul and Harry Tong, as well as reference =
materials received by Audrey, Sriram, and Pierce for additional detail.</li=
>
</ul>
<h4 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.5rem">c. Meeting =
Coordination</h4><ul>
<li>Follow-up call scheduled with Paul at 10:30 Eastern the same day (June =
12).</li>
<li>Functional alignment call with HR team at 11:00 AM.</li>
<li>The primary target is to have a draft dashboard/report ready for Jeff=
=E2=80=99s call on June 13 at 10:30 or 10:00 Eastern (uncertainty over exac=
t time; agenda not yet distributed).</li>

t, what&#39;s the best place by that I mean like if they automatically have=
, if they have some automated thing in JIRA where they maintain the defects=
 etc. It&#39;s just a daily report out of JIRA that we can get. I just pain=
ted and that&#39;s correspond to this, right? If not the 30 day look ahead =
what is testing? I&#39;m looking at this as a, again a table that says, you=
 know how many apps are again the table. If this same table should give us =
a report that we can run on UAT coming up within, you know, some date range=
, does that make sense? So use that same table because we know UAT&#39;s an=
d coming up the stock end and status. Hopefully 99% or 100% would say not s=
tarted. But if you run a report that says here&#39;s a UAT coming up within=
 the next 30 days or create a report that says give me UAT within the next =
30 days, you may have a lookup or it comes into a dashboard. Eventually we&=
#39;ll do this as a dashboard, but we can at least say here&#39;s a link, y=
ou know, and if you double click into that number it takes you into a diffe=
rent, you know, again power BI will help so much in this but for now a stat=

easy it will be to add columns to manipulate that data for me without a lic=

 could probably use your help is with taking a pass at some of these summar=

lidate. We have data in various places from these functional alignment call=

baseline that I just sent you for what we have. And then I&#39;m going to s=
tart to pull in the real information for like SAT start, satend, UAT start,=
 UAT end status, et cetera, wherever possible, and try and get this defect =
data from Srinivas. So if you can take a pass at just summary tables, I wil=
l start to consolidate the data and try and pull some things in. And then w=
e can connect. We have this functional alignment with HR at 11, and then af=
