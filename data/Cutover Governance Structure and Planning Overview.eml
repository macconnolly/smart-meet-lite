------------------------------
Preface & Objectives

   - The session focused on restructuring and organizing the project=E2=80=
=99s
   cutover processes.
   - Key leaders were involved to drive clarity, alignment, and smooth
   handover of responsibilities.
   - The aim was to agree on goals, deliverables, and criteria for success
   heading towards the legal entity split (A1/Day 1/BRV) and to establish
   actionable structures for moving forward.

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Cutover Governance and Team Structure

   - Rob presented slides outlining cutover governance, prompting feedback
   for comprehensive alignment.
   - The cutover structure consists of both global leadership and
   process/domain-specific leads:
      - *Steven S.* as overall cutover lead, with *Rob L.* supporting.
      - End-to-End (E2E) process leads for Order to Cash (Q2C), Procure to
      Pay (P2P =E2=80=93 Direct/Indirect), Intercompany, Logistics & Planni=
ng,
Record to
      Report (R2R), and Hire to Retire (H2R).
      - Functional teams span IT, ISC, Finance, Legal, Trade Compliance,
      and Communications.
   - Emphasis on cross-functional collaboration and clarity in points of
   contact.

2. Roles, Representation, and Workstream Leads

   - Discussion on naming conventions and ensuring balanced representation
   for key streams (AI vs. S&D), particularly in logistics and planning.
   - Agreed to have both *Martin* and *Mark* lead logistics, with
   consideration for adding *Michael Oakes* for planning.
   - Adjustments in leads reflected, e.g., Mihela T. (Sales side/OTC),
   addition of Otelia as alternate.
   - Clarity sought for additional names/specialists that may need
   inclusion, with ongoing opportunity to update the structure.

3. Meeting Cadence, Calendar Alignment & Escalation Channels

   - Current meeting structure reviewed (Friday direct meeting, RAIL call).
   - Proposal: Establish a regular weekly checkpoint, preferably Mondays,
   for progress review, metric tracking, and issue escalation.
   - Dialogue around overlap with existing touchpoints (e.g., with Rajeev
   on Tuesdays for indirect, Fridays for procurement) to minimize redundanc=
y.
   - Agreed to trial the Monday meeting, reassess after one week, and
   potentially consolidate with currently running meetings if possible and
   effective.
   - Mondays offer pre-week alignment; Fridays close out the week's work.

4. Jurisdiction & Regional Functional Involvement

   - Cutover processes largely managed centrally for order-to-cash and
   related streams.
   - Regions (APAC, EMEA, Americas) may require additional representation
   for on-the-ground escalation:
      - *Tracy (APAC)* for mining/logistics.
      - *Andre (EMEA)* for S&D supply chain.
      - *Francisco/Chris Barovi (Finance/EMEA)* for financial
      infrastructure and indirect POS readiness.
   - Action to further review if LATAM is sufficiently represented and
   clarify local roles as needed.
   - Ongoing review to determine which processes are globally managed and
   where local point people are necessary.

5. Defining Deliverables: =E2=80=9CWhat Does Good Look Like?=E2=80=9D

   - High-level discussion on critical deliverables and artifacts for
   cutover success:
      - *Hypercare*: Plan, governance, and comms channels ready before
      go-live/Day 1.
      - *Cutover Workplans*: Developed per category/scenario (SOs, POs,
      STOs), incorporating key milestones and regional/jurisdictional
specifics.
      - *KPIs*: Clearly defined metrics to monitor before, during, and
      after cutover (e.g., open/intercompany sales orders, vendor conversio=
ns).
   - Timeline milestones reviewed (from images):
      - Milestones and activities mapped from May through August 1, 2025.
      - Deadlines for plan finalization, KPI definition, workplan drafting,
      hypercare leadership, and go-live dates.

6. Key Metrics & Tracking Tools

   - Agreement to draft a KPI/metrics template (area, metric, importance,
   data source, owner) for standardized tracking, visibility, and issue
   flagging.
   - Noted: tracking must be transparent, accessible, and actionable,
   feeding directly into the weekly checkpoint.
   - A dashboard concept proposed to centralize status across
   milestones/workstreams, to drive the Monday meeting=E2=80=99s focus.

7. Engagement with IT & UAT Testing

   - Discussion around current/planned engagement with IT:
      - Noted that IT has been responsive, but emphasis on =E2=80=9Ctrust b=
ut
      verify=E2=80=9D going forward.
      - UAT sessions scheduled for June; questions raised about scope and
      value given limited SAP changes other than legal entity mapping.
      - Concern about SAP instance support duration (current support
      assured for 18 months post-spin, but risks remain).
   - Planned meeting with IT PMO on Thursday to review stream coordination
   and invite planning leads for better integration.

8. Upcoming Workshops & Next Steps

   - Regional LES readiness workshops scheduled as follows:
      - *APAC*: June 12=E2=80=9313, 2025
      - *EMEA*: June 17=E2=80=9318, 2025
      - *Americas*: June 23=E2=80=9324, 2025
   - Workshops will have a cutover planning component, including one-page
   country summaries with open order data and status.
   - Appointees for workshops already identified; indirect participation
   will be coordinated as needed, with remote as default unless travel is
   justified due to collaboration needs.
   - Workshop deliverable: summary of open orders and general approach by
   category for each country with relevant legal entity changes.

------------------------------
ImagesImage 1: LES Cutover Governance Model

   - Organizational chart outlining roles from global oversight (LES SMO,
   Jeff H., Evan S., Jordan M.) down through process leads (Steven S., Rob =
L.,
   etc.) for each workstream and cutover function.
   - Highlights both confirmed leads and areas where roles are TBD.
   - Structure ensures visible accountability and cross-functional
   responsibility for all aspects of cutover, including IT, Finance, Legal,
   and Trade Compliance.

Image 2: Team Roles & Responsibilities

   - Hierarchical structure from Global LES SMO to Area/Country teams.
   - Clearly defines main responsibilities at each layer (e.g., timeline
   definition, critical issue resolution, execution at local/site level).
   - Emphasizes the need to free up bandwidth by setting unambiguous
   ownership and communication flow.

Image 3: Cutover Planning Key Dates (Laptop)

   - Visual timeline tracking cutover activities from May through July.
   - Activities include kickoff, drafting approaches, scheduling cadence,
   defining KPIs, developing templates/workplans, and confirming hypercare
   governance.
   - Each activity tied to responsible owners and status markers
   ("Complete", "On Track").
   - Context: presented from a home office setup, signaling remote
   collaboration.

Image 4: Cutover Planning Project Timeline

   - More detailed Gantt-style timeline mapping specific activities (A=E2=
=80=93N)
   and their due dates, owners, and current status.
   - Visual aid for tracking progress, accountability, and flagging issues
   ahead of key milestones like go-live (August 1, 2025).
   - Embedded in virtual meeting context (video participants shown),
   underscoring collaborative review.

=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Rob0:02
Okay, let's get rolling.
Stephen0:07
So maybe a little preface. Rob, if you want to start sharing, wanted to get
the key leaders engaged. We're working cut over processes. I have to
applaud the team for some fantastic work to date. I think everyone realized
early on that this was going to be a very heavy lift to do it well, to
avoid risks. And by and large, we're at the point now where we've got some
general strategies, we got to work, a little bit of timing type stuff, but
we got an overall view of what kind of needs to be done. We wanted to use
this opportunity to maybe reset a little bit and start getting us a little
more structured. And what I'm hoping maybe we can get out of this meeting
is, I would say, some agreement on what does good look like by a one, you
know, what deliverables we need to get in place to be successful. I want to
get this kind of out of. I want to get this program as we go kind of more
into your hands and help us all, again, paint the picture of what good is
going to look like and then give folks some independence to start driving
towards that. I think if we, particularly if this team's all on the same
page of how we move forward, we can start moving forward, I think, in a
more smooth, structured fashion as opposed to whack a mole as we go
forward. So with that, Rob can put together some slides on maybe some
governance as we move forward and want to get your. Your thoughts. This
meeting. Success is successful. You know, we should come up with items that
you guys all agree are the right is the right approach and the right things
that we should be working on. You know, not a. Not an ad hoc request. So
please be vocal, speak up of what you think you need to be successful and
solstice ultimately successful. All right, Rob, you want to take it over?
Rob2:29
Yeah. And I think just to reiterate Stephen's point, you know, the goal
here is to solicit some feedback if you see something that's not captured
or not representative of, you know, how we think, the way the work gets
done. You know, please, please feel free to interrupt and jump in and add
some context. But I think at a high level, you know, when we think of our
cutover work stream, there's obviously going to be some activities that are
going to be occurring at Hard Spin. But, you know, our primary focus, we
think of the vast majority of activities that are occurring under LES are
going to be our activities that are required for our countries that are
going live or have legal entity changes on A1, on our BRV or legal entity
go live dates. So the way that we've largely been working, a lot of the
processes to date that we've tried to capture here, you know, our open
sales orders, or more broadly our order to cash approach, our procure to
pay approach from both a direct and indirect lens, our intercompany or SCO
open orders. I think we'll probably need a little bit of refinement about
how we think about production logistics and planning. That group together,
that kind of broken out record to report and hire to retire. I think the
last two processes I think are going to be operating a little bit more
independently as opposed to kind of the very heavy cross functional nature
that we've all seen in our workshops and other calls for many of these
processes. So R2, R and H2 record to report and hire to retire will be a
little bit more functional, driven within finance, controllership and HR
for those two end to end processes respectively. But I think the way that
we're thinking through this is, you know, at this point, Steven is our
overall cutover lead and then we have individuals that help coordinate and
manage from an end to end process perspective. Those are the names that you
see at the top. You'll see that we then have, you know, a functional lead
going across each of these work streams will be the point of contact to
help coordinate to make sure that, you know, for example, units for AR
would be the point of contact to make sure that our approaches across these
end to end processes are viable or documented and supported by current
plans and operations. So I'll kind of pause here to see if there's any
initial questions, thoughts, feedback on, you know, the way the team wants
to think about kind of structuring the work.
Stephen5:26
Yeah, I think the one we've got, the production logistics and planning, I
think we should just call that, I don't know. Martin and Mark, your
thoughts? But I'm thinking just logistics. And one thing we noted last week
is we have to be careful. Probably because I'm most familiar with the
folks. Right. There's a lot of the people we have engaged are AIs heavy, I
would say. So I'm looking through these leaders. We got to make sure that
we've got good representation for both AIs and S& D. So I guess Martin and
Mark, I'm kind of leaning towards. I think we should have both your names
in the logistics front, but open.
Jason6:12
To your thoughts for me, makes sense because Mark knows his business and I
know mine, so makes sense to have Both, in my opinion. Unless Mark things
different.
Rob6:23
No, no, I agree.
Neil6:26
Are we going to have a separate column for planning?
Stephen6:32
Maybe it should be. Well, let's call it. Maybe it's intercompany, STL and
planning. Maybe that's where we rename it. It's probably a better way to
frame it.
Rob6:41
Something.
Stephen6:41
It's the same people. Yeah.
Martin6:47
Similarly, I would put Michael Oakes there then.
Rob6:51
Yeah, yeah.
Stephen6:54
And then I think Mike Lingle, I guess I'm gonna know you. I think Michael
Oakes sent this for this to you. Is that right?
Martin7:02
Yeah, I'm covering for him today.
Stephen7:05
Okay. I think with that we got the top column square and I think you.
Neil7:14
Can put Mihela on the sales order site with the first column on the left.
Or Otelia probably as well. Or maybe one of the two on the first column on
the left. OTC sales app.
Rob7:34
Sorry, go ahead.
Stephen7:35
Yeah, I pick one.
Neil7:37
One or the other separately anyway. And the ar. I think it's okay to put
Mihaila T. Yeah.
Stephen7:59
Okay.
Rob8:03
Yeah, I think just maybe to Stephen, your point, if there's other folks so
that we're representing kind of both parts of the parts of the business
that we want to add here, maybe feel free to share that as a, you know, as
a follow up, you know, to continue it, you know, update this further as
needed. Okay. So I think piece two is just thinking a little bit about, you
know, how we want to structure, you know, our discussions. I think that,
you know, to take it. If you look on Friday, we already have, you know, a
so and STO or I'm really kind of thinking that as kind of our, you know,
order to cash and our inner company rail session that can also be used for
any other issues, etc. From you know, order to cash or. Or intercompany
perspective. We've now added Anna and team to the direct Friday meeting. I
think that this probably needs to be expanded to an hour and then we have a
standing rail call that also has cross functional input that if we ever
have any broader updates that we can use from that perspective, I do think
that we still need to have a once a week call once. And this is the call
you see in red there on Wednesday. I don't think it needs to be Wednesday.
I almost wonder if Mondays, if we wanted to use like a time like this going
forward to be a once a week check in to talk through, you know, where are
we across some of our key milestones, you know, do we have processes
defined? Do we where, you know, different updates on work Plan development.
I think as we get into issues that need to be escalated, I think it can be
the primary escalation channel across our end to end processes for open
issues. So wanted to get the team's feedback from a timing perspective on
this time. Worked for a weekly touchpoint with this team.
Stephen10:31
And kind of think about it again. This is brainstorming meaningful folks.
So please share your thoughts. We should I think with my name is at Rajeev
because the other piece of the MoS that you're probably not even aware of,
Rob, is Rajeev also has various report outs for these folks. Right. So we
got to make sure we get these. We gotta make sure thing language. And do
you think it makes.
Rob10:59
Sorry. God. All these.
Stephen11:07
Who'S wearing deuce duplicate meetings?
Mark11:09
Yeah, Rob, I vote for Mondays. I'm good for Mondays. We got Rajiv on
Tuesdays. We got the tie out with direct and indirect on Fridays. I think
with. With Mondays if we start ahead of time, we. We tie out end of the
week. I close the week on Friday with Daniel and dj. So I think that would
work.
Rob11:29
Okay.
Stephen11:30
And I'm getting your thoughts here, right? I mean do we combine your
Tuesday meeting with Rajeev, Right. Do we try to make this all together or
do you think that.
Mark11:42
Ok, so let me actually check. So we've had traditionally every Tuesday a
review for indirect with Rajiv that also ties covers indirect productivity
pipeline and anything that's transition related. So we can pull if needed.
But I'm okay to also report out on Fridays is where we have the actions
right aligned with direct and indirect all of procurement together. And
today I think on Mondays we can tie out with the wider audience if there's
any IAC related topics. If there's maintenance, I don't have a day without
half of it at least going to solstice. So I'm good either way.
Stephen12:25
Yeah.
Mark12:27
Hey, another the meeting you're referencing with Rajiv, is that the Spinco
indirect execution progress? No, that's on top of that. That's our
traditional. Yes, we have. That's what I thought because I was seeing the
other one on Thursday.
Rob12:40
Okay.
Mark12:42
Yeah, that's bonus.
Martin12:48
Steven, the question, I guess, does this would this process cover the scope
of things like the transition of the ERP or S&P or UAT testing for that
reporting all those types of things. Should we be including that in this
umbrella or those are related to legal entity split?
Stephen13:12
My answer would be some of that. I think ERP cutover. I think we got to
stay abreast of Pretty closely. But I don't know if it's.
Rob13:26
Something.
Stephen13:26
That we create another meeting for. Right. I think we got to stay in tune
there. But UAT as it relates to Cutover, certainly. Right. I think that
makes sense.
Mark13:40
I pull in it for all of these conversations because. Yeah, I think they're
at the core of a fac. They're a facilitator across the board. Right. For
all of. For all of them. Because first comes the legal setup. Right, Rob?
And that's what we're mirroring ourselves. First comes the legal setup, and
then the systems and processes need to reflect those changes. That's how it
should be. And then it makes that happen. Or at least for me, there are.
And we have Joe. I think we just need to add Rahul Kulkarni maybe for our
ERP piece, because that's very important and we should be okay.
Neil14:17
Well, I think ERP may be Rahul, but I think Pierce is there on this call,
Rakesh is there on this call. They're covering it PMO across the domains
for it. So I would definitely include their names here.
Rob14:32
Yeah, yeah. I think just at a high level, I think the focus would obviously
be, you know, kind of the process leads, but I think we. We would include
it. We would include probably one person from controllership and probably
Eric from. So there would be some functional representation as well. Well,
maybe my suggestion would be. Cause I understand that there's also follow
ups with Rajeev and we want to try to minimize meetings. Maybe I'll propose
we have this meeting next week just as we try to, you know, make sure that
we have all of our structure and dates in place. And then next week, if we
find it productive and helpful, great, we continue it. And if we feel
comfortable that we're able to kind of drop off and it makes more sense to
just manage through the existing Rajeev touch points. That works. Maybe
that'd be my suggestion.
Stephen15:42
Yeah. I'm sending a note to Rajeev now to see if me and him can get
together and just, you know, look at the different pieces of the MOS's and
see what we can do to bring them together.
Rob15:56
Perfect.
Stephen15:57
Hopefully we get that done this week. Meeting set next week.
Rob16:05
And then I think so anyways. I think those are the key pieces of this
slide. You'll note that we do have this. And this is not a discussion for
today, it's more of an FYI. We do have. You know, as we get closer to 81,
eventually we're going to need to have some Ramped up cadence where we're
actually managing the execution of our cutover plans. You know where
there's going to be activities and understand a lot of this will be it
driven but activities that are going to need to be designated as occurring,
you know, hour by hour leading up to a one it's going to be a cross
functional. A cross functional effort and obviously after eight one that
will develop into hypercare. So I think the current thought from the team
is you know we're going to need to have you know a regional touch point as
we you know come up in that those weeks leading up to cutover to help
manage the actual execution. I think there's some more thinking and thought
that needs to go in there but just wanted to give the team a heads up.
That's, that's what that gray middle row is that we hadn't haven't spoken
about. And Steven, maybe quick question. If we did end up needing like a
regional point of contact, you know, for you know, for APAC or you know to
help manage, you know, the actual cross functional execution itself, do we
think that there's ISC resources that you know, an ISC resource for APAC
for example or one for EMEA that would be best to help manage that cross
functionally. As we think about the actual X over cut over execution. I
think maybe part of it's IC and part of its it but I'm just trying to think
through that piece.
Stephen17:58
Yeah, I'm looking through the top categories now. I mean I think and team
speak up but I think from order to cash perspective that's very well
centrally managed. I don't see a regional by regional anything similarly
with. Yeah, that's correct.
Martin18:20
Yes. But I would say like Tracy now is. Isn't she kind of leading all of
mining and logistics for apac? So wouldn't she be someone we want to keep
involved to kind of be a lead if we need to have escalations or what have
you.
Stephen18:40
Looking to Martin and Mark?
Rob18:41
I don't know. I. I think so. I don't think you'd want to. Yeah. Take her
out of it.
Martin18:52
And then in emea I and I think Andre is going to be a key piece of most of
the impact is going to be on S and D in emea.
Stephen19:05
Right.
Martin19:05
And he is the key leader for EMEA supply chain. So planning. I think those
two individuals need to be heavily involved.
Rob19:17
And Sorry, what was the spelling for the first name.
Martin19:22
For Tracy?
Rob19:23
Oh sorry Tracy.
Martin19:24
Now you're right, you're right there on the. Sorry you're on amia. It's
just Andre.
Rob19:28
Okay.
Martin19:32
Apac, I think, I think Tracy.
Rob19:42
But anyway, I don't think we need to. I think there's probably more
discussion here, but just trying to give the team some visibility and see
if there was any thoughts on how we're thinking through. You know, for some
processes, if they're totally globally managed, you know, we may say, hey,
we don't, we don't really need to have kind of designated leads where in
other cases, if it's a little bit more, you know, heavier portion of work
is done in, done in region or in country, we may want to think about how we
have that designated. But maybe, maybe we can put some thought into that
and we can try to talk about that next week.
Mark20:19
Rob, what about finance?
Rob20:24
So these, these are just intended to be the end to end processes, I think
already within just the general LES structure. And Francisco, keep me
honest here, but we do have global and regional functional points of
contact.
Mark20:43
I was asking strictly. Yeah, I was, I was asking from a regional finance
step perspective because at least in the indirect workshop, Chris Barovi
was quite vocal in terms of getting her involved as well or anything that
covers our area or at least to have a regional finance. And that's for two
standpoints. One is also maintenance of the funding elements, cost centers,
network IDs, project IDs as needed because that's been one of our key value
modes and it was strictly for the MOs around the maintenance on the finance
hierarchy infrastructure. Right. And also of course the billing tax model
that we're going to follow. But we don't have clarity today how we're going
to manage some transactions.
Rob21:25
Got it. And you mind pinging that name to me, Anna?
Mark21:31
Sure.
Rob21:32
Thank you, but no, that is helpful. I think a little more work to be done
on this front, but the end goal will to be to make sure that, you know, for
each, for each process just aligning on is it largely centrally managed or
are we going to have some designated point of contacts? Okay, I think the
last thing, I'm.
Stephen22:04
Sorry, we bring Chris in. Is she, I mean, is Selza impacted by this
whatsoever?
Mark22:12
To be careful, she only asked and raised this. When it comes to the
indirect POS in terms of readiness, transition and cost center hierarchy
measures and approvals, she raised some concerns that those might actually
be caught in the middle. Theoretically. ZELTA is not under a name and reuse
scenario. They're not affected by the changes. We're running due diligence
to make sure that's the Case she was more concerned on being involved in a
couple of build back tools that are used in the P2P scenario that are
critical for sites like, like expediting payments, posting outside of the
PO process, that kind of stuff that directly impacts them.
Rob22:55
Okay.
Stephen23:02
Okay. Well I guess while we're here, anything anyone else think that
specifically some different regions are underrepresented?
Jason23:17
I suppose we don't have any real concern. Or is does LATAM come under the
Americas for you guys the way you're viewing this?
Rob23:24
Yeah.
Jason23:25
Okay.
Stephen23:31
It's the plural Americas even though it's in the U.S. believe there's only
one. There's two couple.
Rob23:43
All right.
Stephen23:46
Okay.
Rob23:47
Yeah, I'll share these out too. So folks, have other thoughts.
Stephen23:53
So I think this is what we were thinking of in terms of again I think
trying to get high level. What does good look like when we're all prepared.
And so Rob took some time here to kind of brainstorm of what do the
artifacts look like if we are doing the right thing here. So I'll kind of
back up. Let's start at. I think I. Oh no, that's B. I'm sorry, let's go
backwards. We'll go to starting in N.
Rob24:34
You.
Stephen24:34
Know we're going to want operate, we're going to want hypercare. Right.
What's the hypercare plan look like as well as communications what needs to
be set up that is hopefully a given. You have the actual cutover dates.
Rob24:54
You.
Stephen24:54
Know to have the hypercarrier structure in place finalizing hypercare
governance. Different communication channels for hyper care needs now
getting to I.
Rob25:07
Right.
Stephen25:07
So this is all stuff that would hopefully be done before July cutover work
plans developed. What do you think that looks like, Rob?
Rob25:23
So I think, I think the idea is that you know like step one is aligning on
like our approach. Like I think of the two first inputs are aligning on our
approach by category for SO POS and stos and our T minus schedule to give
us our key dates. I think we have the T minus schedule confirmed for direct
PO and for sos and I think it's still pending or at least we need to
finalize it for indirect and SEOs. So I think that's one input and the
second that I think we're nearly the way there is just making sure that
we're clear based on the different scenario types what our path forward is.
So I think those are kind of the two inputs. I think then our you know, I
think intended plan was for this week to set up some calls with it. With
cx, with Procurement, with Finance, with treasury and try to populate what
we think the key milestones are. You know again this is not going to be
region specific in order to effectuate, effectuate cutover. So that's going
to be things like you know, inventory all list of customers with open
orders, determine those that will be in transit on D terms that will
require orders to be pre generated. It may be cleaning up order backlogs.
You know, so kind of the key milestones and some of these just from our
discussions, you know, we've taken a crack at trying to define and I'm
hoping by end of this week we can have a view by function of you know,
what, what are the key key milestones from a cutover perspective. And again
understanding a lot of work is being done from an IT perspective so we'll
need to stay close to them. So that was kind of our. You see that six, six
date and again I think that may be a little ambitious but that was to kind
of get the key milestones. And then after that I think there's going to be
you know, between end of this week and end of this month, right between our
BRB meeting on 6 26. I think we'd like to get that more reviewed with a
jurisdictional lens. You know, where do we have F gas issues in Canada
versus you know, additional import considerations in India and those get
customized. So I think hopefully there's not an overwhelming amount of
customer of jurisdiction customization. But I think at a high level that
was was the thought to start kind of these process cutover plans at a
global level and then you know, to the extent for example that we do have
an order to cash person in country or an order to cash person in region
getting their feedback on where customization is needed. But again
certainly open to feedback from the team. That's kind of processes we've
seen work before. If there's further adjustment to Honeywell structure that
you think would be more productive, you know, definitely open to the
feedback.
Stephen28:56
Right. And then bringing us kind of into now ish we've got defined key KPIs
now in my view this is right. I mean okay, let's go to stos. Right. So
there's going to be a number of old legal entity sales orders in transit
that might be a key KPI that we need to track to make sure that we're
getting this you know, burned down indirect side. I'm not sure it's, it's
how many vendors are properly have properly. How many vendors have properly
Set us up in their system.
Rob29:43
Right.
Stephen29:43
How many have we converted? What are like, you know, there's a lot of data
that we need to collect to make sure that we're on track for this cutover.
These should be self developed and things that you guys need, I would say
in addition to that. Right. We know how these programs go. People are going
to want to see the data. So not just, you know, keeping that like in a
shared location so we know that we're on track or off track. So there'd be
KPIs, I think leading into cutover and then there's probably key KPIs after
cutover that we want to make sure we're tracking to make sure that they're
burning down at a appreciable level.
Martin30:32
Yeah. Do you want to have like a. Someone just create a template that we
can put our metrics in there, make it, make it simple and.
Rob30:44
Yeah, we can, we can do that. We'll create a template and can share it with
this team for folks to propose metrics.
Stephen30:50
Yeah, it's probably like area metric. Why is it important? And then maybe
even a link, right. A link to where others can get it and see it. Maybe
that's the best way to do it. Something owner. That makes sense. I mean,
Anna, you're probably thinking something similar that you need for
indirect. Right? See status. I mean you're going to be cleaning up indirect
invoices and crap ahead of time.
Mark31:28
Yeah, well, 90% everything that is in the current ERP stays there. Right.
We're just going to get them updated to the new legal entities. But that's
84% of the vault volumes, which are very high. But yes, okay, we'll have,
we'll have cleanup and then we'll have execution and key deliverables are
probably going to be actions. We're also tracking it between soft spin and
day one as well because there's a lot of. For indirect. There's going to be
a heavy amount of activities that will be pushed out into hard spin, not
soft spin.
Stephen32:00
Yeah.
Mark32:01
And that's on account of many decisions that will need to be taken in the
meantime with data we don't have today.
Stephen32:10
Anything else team. So we tried. Rob, primarily Rob tried thinking through
and laying this all out there so that we know where we're going. Any other
big key deliverables that you think need to be done for us to be successful
that maybe are not being captured here because the hope is we get aligned
and you know, the team can just go would be the hope.
Jason32:45
Not That I can think the only question I got Steven, probably not even
better to is how engaged are we with it and all these pieces and everything
that we've done so far that's been done so far.
Stephen33:01
Not horribly. It's actually when we ask they're actually fairly responsive
and have a decent plan.
Martin33:10
So related to that, Steven Martin, I know sri, I'm on hold but he's, he's
working to set up a call this Thursday with the IT PMO because there are a
lot of different work streams coming at us at this point and I asked him to
invite all the planning leads, Mark and Martin CX so that we can kind of
hear how do we get a little more organized Because I feel like we're okay.
Jason33:33
It's kind of where my brain is at, Jason.
Stephen33:36
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Martin33:38
So I would say yeah.
Stephen33:40
In terms of the homage Trust but verify. It's been a lot of trust, not a
lot of verify.
Jason33:49
No, it's only because they're also arranging, aren't they? They've got, I
can't remember the title of it Jason, you responded to it but they've got
various UAT or looking to schedule numerous UAT sessions at some point in
June but also looking to have a workshop in person also in New Jersey in
June. So they reached out looking for people to, you know, to be put
forward for that. Which indicated to me that if we're looking at that UAT
starting to test that UAT point in June, then there's a lot of work to be
done and probably from the outputs of that a lot of findings to be found.
Martin34:31
Yeah, potentially I'm hopeful that this is kind of testing for testing's
sake because we have to, we're not fundamentally changing SAP right in the
back end so that it's tied to legal NC correctly. So I, I would think there
wouldn't be a lot of things uncovered but that's probably.
Jason34:48
We can hope Jason.
Rob34:49
I'm with you. I'm with you.
Mark34:54
The only thing I'm worried about is about the SAP's well the instances
future. Right. Because my understanding is it's going out of support next
year.
Jason35:03
Well, we were told 18 months and one of the earlier calls we were told that
they will continue supporting post 18 months post spin because we raised
that same concern. I'm still concerned Even it being 18 months out from
there but it doesn't take away the concern.
Stephen35:20
It just affirms 18 months is not enough. But no, it's definitely on the
radar. It was discussed back in November, December Strategy is kind of
where it's at today from that.
Rob35:38
Okay.
Stephen35:40
All right. So this will be kind of our guiding light, I think, as we go.
Jason35:44
Forward.
Rob35:50
I think, and hopefully. So I think the idea then would be like if we look
at these as kind of our, our key, our key activities and these activities
are going to largely occur across work stream or across our end to end
process. I think the idea would be, you know, and again, format still being
finalized, but whether we have some sort of dashboard that we can use on
this Monday call. Right. We're like these, for example, are some of these
milestones across the top. Right. And again, this is illustrative. Don't
over read into it. But I think the idea is, you know, the primary focus on
those Monday touch points, you know, can then be, you know, by each of our
processes. Where do we need help? What are the key issues? Is there a
meeting that, you know, needs to be scheduled that's having trouble, that
we're having trouble finalizing that will help, you know, with some key
decisions. So, you know, we'll, we'll share out a proposed draft view of
this later this week. But I think the idea is that, you know, whatever
these items are that we kind of align on, you know, here, right. We, we
tried to, you know, keep that to the focus of our discussion in our, in our
Monday touch points, but. Well, again assuming that we keep them for now,
understanding Steven, pending the feedback we get from Rajeev that may be
looped in or coordinated with existing calls. I think just the last thing
to give folks a heads up on is there is a regional workshop that is being
scheduled for APAC next week as well as AMEA in America's for later in the
month. These workshops are going to have a cutover component to them.
They're LES workshops and they're essentially gonna, they're the readiness
sessions that are being done in advance of the BRB meeting on June 26. So
the APAC workshop is, let's see, I have the dates here. The APAC workshop
is the 12th and 13th. The EMEA workshop is the 17th and the 18th. In the
Americas workshop is the 23rd and the 24th. So I think just in the near
term, one thing that you know, that we're going to do, there's essentially
going to be a, you know, a packet of slides that the LES team is putting
together for every country. I think they're the select countries where we
have a rename and reuse country like so say for example for, you know,
Japan, right In, in apac. We've been asked to pull together a one page
summary on cutover for each country and I think, I think my thought process
and open to feedback from this team would be. It's. It's a summary of open.
You know we, we take the, the open order data that we have. I mean I can
just reach out to Prefa or Daniel or Jason and just try to get the number
of open orders for these specific countries. I can put it in a simple Excel
file to pre populate but we've been asked to have to ensure that we can at
least have a high level summary of from a cutover perspective. You know
where, where do we see the open orders? You know just so that the t. The.
The cross functional teams in those les workshops can get a sense of what's
the general approach by category and, and do we see a big cutover lift in
this country.
Stephen39:55
Let's try out with schedule time meet you and Neil, talk that over.
Rob40:00
Okay.
Stephen40:01
We've got appointees for these workshops. I think Neil's the stucky for the
APAC one or really there's hardly any content to speak of. Amaya is going
to be. I think that was. Is that Mahala Shuram? Do you remember?
Rob40:18
Nope.
Stephen40:18
Shrimp is off. We had folks for Ameya pinpointed already which sounds like
it's gonna be a huge push on Ireland entity anyway. Yeah, I don't know why
they're even having the meeting to be honest.
Rob40:35
Then yeah, is the big one.
Mark40:38
If you need any face to face participation, please give us a heads up. Rob,
just. I want to make sure if indirect is needed I can pull my team members
in ahead of time. Because we struggled for the indirect workshop to have it
face to face. We ended up doing it remotely which turned out fine. But.
Rob40:58
Yeah, well like I think from a location perspective, I think the operating
assumption. Unless this team. And please let me. If anyone thinks it makes
sense to travel for these workshops, you know, let me know and you know we
can. You know me, Stephen, Evan can coordinate I assume the, I think the,
the prime. So the, the primary one that would be difficult is obviously is
obviously apac just because that will go from time zone wise it will be
something like 8pm into you know Eastern time. It's like 8pm to to 5am so.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well yeah, so we'll. I'll coordinate with Stephen, you
and Neil on that but I think for now the request is going to be let's. I'll
follow up with the relevant team members and it'll be a data request. It
helps us to be very simple. Just open orders by category. But. But, yeah,
we'll circle back to the team after we learn on that.

height:1.6">So maybe a little preface. Rob, if you want to start sharing, w=
anted to get the key leaders engaged. We&#39;re working cut over processes.=
 I have to applaud the team for some fantastic work to date. I think everyo=
ne realized early on that this was going to be a very heavy lift to do it w=
ell, to avoid risks. And by and large, we&#39;re at the point now where we&=
#39;ve got some general strategies, we got to work, a little bit of timing =
type stuff, but we got an overall view of what kind of needs to be done. We=
 wanted to use this opportunity to maybe reset a little bit and start getti=
ng us a little more structured. And what I&#39;m hoping maybe we can get ou=
t of this meeting is, I would say, some agreement on what does good look li=
ke by a one, you know, what deliverables we need to get in place to be succ=
essful. I want to get this kind of out of. I want to get this program as we=
 go kind of more into your hands and help us all, again, paint the picture =
of what good is going to look like and then give folks some independence to=
 start driving towards that. I think if we, particularly if this team&#39;s=
 all on the same page of how we move forward, we can start moving forward, =
I think, in a more smooth, structured fashion as opposed to whack a mole as=
 we go forward. So with that, Rob can put together some slides on maybe som=
e governance as we move forward and want to get your. Your thoughts. This m=
eeting. Success is successful. You know, we should come up with items that =
you guys all agree are the right is the right approach and the right things=
 that we should be working on. You know, not a. Not an ad hoc request. So p=
lease be vocal, speak up of what you think you need to be successful and so=
lstice ultimately successful. All right, Rob, you want to take it over?</di=

an></div><div style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Yeah. =
And I think just to reiterate Stephen&#39;s point, you know, the goal here =
is to solicit some feedback if you see something that&#39;s not captured or=
 not representative of, you know, how we think, the way the work gets done.=
 You know, please, please feel free to interrupt and jump in and add some c=
ontext. But I think at a high level, you know, when we think of our cutover=
 work stream, there&#39;s obviously going to be some activities that are go=
ing to be occurring at Hard Spin. But, you know, our primary focus, we thin=
k of the vast majority of activities that are occurring under LES are going=
 to be our activities that are required for our countries that are going li=
ve or have legal entity changes on A1, on our BRV or legal entity go live d=
ates. So the way that we&#39;ve largely been working, a lot of the processe=
s to date that we&#39;ve tried to capture here, you know, our open sales or=
ders, or more broadly our order to cash approach, our procure to pay approa=
ch from both a direct and indirect lens, our intercompany or SCO open order=
s. I think we&#39;ll probably need a little bit of refinement about how we =
think about production logistics and planning. That group together, that ki=
nd of broken out record to report and hire to retire. I think the last two =
processes I think are going to be operating a little bit more independently=
 as opposed to kind of the very heavy cross functional nature that we&#39;v=
e all seen in our workshops and other calls for many of these processes. So=
 R2, R and H2 record to report and hire to retire will be a little bit more=
 functional, driven within finance, controllership and HR for those two end=
 to end processes respectively. But I think the way that we&#39;re thinking=
 through this is, you know, at this point, Steven is our overall cutover le=
ad and then we have individuals that help coordinate and manage from an end=
 to end process perspective. Those are the names that you see at the top. Y=
ou&#39;ll see that we then have, you know, a functional lead going across e=
ach of these work streams will be the point of contact to help coordinate t=
o make sure that, you know, for example, units for AR would be the point of=
 contact to make sure that our approaches across these end to end processes=
 are viable or documented and supported by current plans and operations. So=
 I&#39;ll kind of pause here to see if there&#39;s any initial questions, t=
houghts, feedback on, you know, the way the team wants to think about kind =
of structuring the work.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;paddin=

ah, I think just maybe to Stephen, your point, if there&#39;s other folks s=
o that we&#39;re representing kind of both parts of the parts of the busine=
ss that we want to add here, maybe feel free to share that as a, you know, =
as a follow up, you know, to continue it, you know, update this further as =
needed. Okay. So I think piece two is just thinking a little bit about, you=
 know, how we want to structure, you know, our discussions. I think that, y=
ou know, to take it. If you look on Friday, we already have, you know, a so=
 and STO or I&#39;m really kind of thinking that as kind of our, you know, =
order to cash and our inner company rail session that can also be used for =
any other issues, etc. From you know, order to cash or. Or intercompany per=
spective. We&#39;ve now added Anna and team to the direct Friday meeting. I=
 think that this probably needs to be expanded to an hour and then we have =
a standing rail call that also has cross functional input that if we ever h=
ave any broader updates that we can use from that perspective, I do think t=
hat we still need to have a once a week call once. And this is the call you=
 see in red there on Wednesday. I don&#39;t think it needs to be Wednesday.=
 I almost wonder if Mondays, if we wanted to use like a time like this goin=
g forward to be a once a week check in to talk through, you know, where are=
 we across some of our key milestones, you know, do we have processes defin=
ed? Do we where, you know, different updates on work Plan development. I th=
ink as we get into issues that need to be escalated, I think it can be the =
primary escalation channel across our end to end processes for open issues.=
 So wanted to get the team&#39;s feedback from a timing perspective on this=
 time. Worked for a weekly touchpoint with this team.</div></div><div style=

 so anyways. I think those are the key pieces of this slide. You&#39;ll not=

re of an FYI. We do have. You know, as we get closer to 81, eventually we&#=
39;re going to need to have some Ramped up cadence where we&#39;re actually=
 managing the execution of our cutover plans. You know where there&#39;s go=
ing to be activities and understand a lot of this will be it driven but act=
ivities that are going to need to be designated as occurring, you know, hou=
r by hour leading up to a one it&#39;s going to be a cross functional. A cr=
oss functional effort and obviously after eight one that will develop into =
hypercare. So I think the current thought from the team is you know we&#39;=
re going to need to have you know a regional touch point as we you know com=
e up in that those weeks leading up to cutover to help manage the actual ex=
ecution. I think there&#39;s some more thinking and thought that needs to g=

9;s what that gray middle row is that we hadn&#39;t haven&#39;t spoken abou=
t. And Steven, maybe quick question. If we did end up needing like a region=
al point of contact, you know, for you know, for APAC or you know to help m=
anage, you know, the actual cross functional execution itself, do we think =
that there&#39;s ISC resources that you know, an ISC resource for APAC for =
example or one for EMEA that would be best to help manage that cross functi=
onally. As we think about the actual X over cut over execution. I think may=
be part of it&#39;s IC and part of its it but I&#39;m just trying to think =

5569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">So I think, I think the idea is that y=
ou know like step one is aligning on like our approach. Like I think of the=
 two first inputs are aligning on our approach by category for SO POS and s=
tos and our T minus schedule to give us our key dates. I think we have the =
T minus schedule confirmed for direct PO and for sos and I think it&#39;s s=
till pending or at least we need to finalize it for indirect and SEOs. So I=
 think that&#39;s one input and the second that I think we&#39;re nearly th=
e way there is just making sure that we&#39;re clear based on the different=
 scenario types what our path forward is. So I think those are kind of the =
two inputs. I think then our you know, I think intended plan was for this w=
eek to set up some calls with it. With cx, with Procurement, with Finance, =
with treasury and try to populate what we think the key milestones are. You=
 know again this is not going to be region specific in order to effectuate,=
 effectuate cutover. So that&#39;s going to be things like you know, invent=
ory all list of customers with open orders, determine those that will be in=
 transit on D terms that will require orders to be pre generated. It may be=
 cleaning up order backlogs. You know, so kind of the key milestones and so=
me of these just from our discussions, you know, we&#39;ve taken a crack at=
 trying to define and I&#39;m hoping by end of this week we can have a view=
 by function of you know, what, what are the key key milestones from a cuto=
ver perspective. And again understanding a lot of work is being done from a=
n IT perspective so we&#39;ll need to stay close to them. So that was kind =
of our. You see that six, six date and again I think that may be a little a=
mbitious but that was to kind of get the key milestones. And then after tha=
t I think there&#39;s going to be you know, between end of this week and en=
d of this month, right between our BRB meeting on 6 26. I think we&#39;d li=
ke to get that more reviewed with a jurisdictional lens. You know, where do=
 we have F gas issues in Canada versus you know, additional import consider=
ations in India and those get customized. So I think hopefully there&#39;s =
not an overwhelming amount of customer of jurisdiction customization. But I=
 think at a high level that was was the thought to start kind of these proc=
ess cutover plans at a global level and then you know, to the extent for ex=
ample that we do have an order to cash person in country or an order to cas=
h person in region getting their feedback on where customization is needed.=
 But again certainly open to feedback from the team. That&#39;s kind of pro=
cesses we&#39;ve seen work before. If there&#39;s further adjustment to Hon=
eywell structure that you think would be more productive, you know, definit=
ely open to the feedback.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;paddi=

 look at these as kind of our, our key, our key activities and these activi=
ties are going to largely occur across work stream or across our end to end=
 process. I think the idea would be, you know, and again, format still bein=
g finalized, but whether we have some sort of dashboard that we can use on =
this Monday call. Right. We&#39;re like these, for example, are some of the=
se milestones across the top. Right. And again, this is illustrative. Don&#=
39;t over read into it. But I think the idea is, you know, the primary focu=
s on those Monday touch points, you know, can then be, you know, by each of=
 our processes. Where do we need help? What are the key issues? Is there a =
meeting that, you know, needs to be scheduled that&#39;s having trouble, th=
at we&#39;re having trouble finalizing that will help, you know, with some =
key decisions. So, you know, we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll share out a proposed draf=
t view of this later this week. But I think the idea is that, you know, wha=
tever these items are that we kind of align on, you know, here, right. We, =
we tried to, you know, keep that to the focus of our discussion in our, in =
our Monday touch points, but. Well, again assuming that we keep them for no=
w, understanding Steven, pending the feedback we get from Rajeev that may b=
e looped in or coordinated with existing calls. I think just the last thing=
 to give folks a heads up on is there is a regional workshop that is being =
scheduled for APAC next week as well as AMEA in America&#39;s for later in =
the month. These workshops are going to have a cutover component to them. T=
hey&#39;re LES workshops and they&#39;re essentially gonna, they&#39;re the=
 readiness sessions that are being done in advance of the BRB meeting on Ju=
ne 26. So the APAC workshop is, let&#39;s see, I have the dates here. The A=
PAC workshop is the 12th and 13th. The EMEA workshop is the 17th and the 18=
th. In the Americas workshop is the 23rd and the 24th. So I think just in t=
he near term, one thing that you know, that we&#39;re going to do, there&#3=
9;s essentially going to be a, you know, a packet of slides that the LES te=
am is putting together for every country. I think they&#39;re the select co=
untries where we have a rename and reuse country like so say for example fo=
r, you know, Japan, right In, in apac. We&#39;ve been asked to pull togethe=
r a one page summary on cutover for each country and I think, I think my th=
ought process and open to feedback from this team would be. It&#39;s. It&#3=
9;s a summary of open. You know we, we take the, the open order data that w=
e have. I mean I can just reach out to Prefa or Daniel or Jason and just tr=
y to get the number of open orders for these specific countries. I can put =
it in a simple Excel file to pre populate but we&#39;ve been asked to have =
to ensure that we can at least have a high level summary of from a cutover =
perspective. You know where, where do we see the open orders? You know just=
 so that the t. The. The cross functional teams in those les workshops can =
get a sense of what&#39;s the general approach by category and, and do we s=
ee a big cutover lift in this country.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bott=

Well yeah, so we&#39;ll. I&#39;ll coordinate with Stephen, you and Neil on =
that but I think for now the request is going to be let&#39;s. I&#39;ll fol=
