Data Consolidation Testing and Coordination Updates

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Data Consolidation and Scheduling Updates
- The team is working on consolidating dispersed data into a single, =
concise location for easier tracking and reporting, especially for the =
upcoming call with Jeff.
- While daily plans are built, some hourly =
scheduling details still need to be updated and formatted.
- The goal is to make it easy for everyone, especially Finance (due to =
overlapping functions), to view all information in one spot.
- The consolidation is expected to be completed on June 20, 2025 ("today").
- There are internal discussions on distinguishing daily versus hourly =
plans for greater clarity.

### 2. Status of SIT and UAT Plans
- SIT (System Integration Testing) plans are to be finalized by June 20, =
2025, with all major details in place.
- UAT (User Acceptance Testing) =
plans, while previously listed as being completed by June 27, 2025, are now=
 targeted for completion by Monday, June 23, 2025.
    - Minor changes are =
expected even after "finalization" due to the dynamic nature of testing and=
 potential unforeseen changes.
- Discussions highlight the need for clear =
communication around deadlines and details, avoiding open-ended dates to =
maintain accountability.

### 3. Communication and Status Reporting
- The communication plan will no longer emphasize email as the central =
strategy to avoid misrepresentation of the team=E2=80=99s methods.
- Status reporting is being adjusted from "draft" to "dashboard developed" =
to present a more finalized appearance and avoid unnecessary concerns.
- Team is coordinating wording adjustments in documentation to clarify =
project status.

### 4. Logistics for On-Site Work
- On-site logistics (e.g=
., access, lunch, parking) need to be finalized; Pierce is responsible for =
confirming these items upon his return.
- There was debate about =
appropriate finalization dates, settling on June 24-25, 2025, to ensure =
everything is ready for on-site activities and access before testing begins=
.

### 5. APAC and EMEA Testing Handoff
- The team is aligned and ready for=
 APAC and EMEA regions to begin testing.
- Handoff to these regions is =
targeted for July 1 or 2, 2025, with final confirmation and coordination =
pending.
- Benny is being contacted to provide support for engaging the =
EMEA team.

## Key Dates & Deadlines

| Item                   | Original =
Date    | Revised Date           |
|------------------------|--------------=
----|------------------------|
| SIT Plan Finalization  | June 20, 2025    =
| =E2=80=94 (still today)        |
| UAT Plan Finalization  | June 27, 2025=
    | June 23, 2025 (Monday) |
| On-site Logistics      | June 27, 2025    =
| June 24-25, 2025       |
| APAC/EMEA Handoff      | Not specified    | =
July 1-2, 2025         |

## Action Items & Follow-Ups

- **Data Consolidation:** Jessica to complete data consolidation and =
formatting for Jeff=E2=80=99s call on June 20, 2025.
- **Plan Differentiation:** Clarify and visually separate daily and hourly =
schedules.
- **Documentation Updates:** Adjust wording to reflect schedule =
clarity and avoid terms that suggest open-endedness or draft status.
- **UAT Timeline Clarification:** Clearly communicate that UAT will be =
finalized by June 23, 2025; ensure changes in date across all references.
- **On-site Logistics:** Pierce to finalize all logistics upon return; push=
 finalization to June 24-25, 2025.
- **APAC/EMEA Coordination:** Determine =
and communicate exact handoff date for testing; Benny to aid in =
coordination.
- **Status Reporting Adjustment:** Shift from reporting =
=E2=80=9Cdraft=E2=80=9D status to =E2=80=9Cdashboard developed=E2=80=9D to =
avoid concerns.

## Additional Points

- The team acknowledges that minor =
adjustments may occur after finalization, but major open items must be =
resolved and plans in place before the next project milestones.
- Strong emphasis on clarity, accountability, and unified documentation for=
 all involved parties.

Going to pull his into here. He =
has his own day by day. So we have the data. It's just more call formatting=
 to put it all into one concise spot.

0:12
Okay, I just, yeah, I, I hear =
the concern.

0:17
I understand. I will try to have this ready for the Jeff=
 call so we can say that it's done. But because it all wasn't in one =
concise spot, we didn't want to confidently say that it's done yet because =
if I showed him this, obviously it doesn't.

0:30
Have everything in it.

0:31
So I will try to have it done. If it is not done, my focus is fit =
because obviously that starts next week. So the information's out there. =
It's just not all in one concise spot. So it's really more of a =
consolidation effort. If it's not, then can we make a distinction between =
the daily and hourly? And so we do have the daily plan built. We're just =
updating some of the hourly scheduling. Yeah, we can absolutely do that. =
And if, if need be, I can flash mini bosses and just say drop them =
combining into one easier tracking. That's really like more where we're at =
with this. So it's not that it's not done, it's just the concise having =
everything in one spot to make it easier to track. Because, you know, our =
concern really is finance because finance is going to have some overlapping=
 functions. We want to make sure that everybody can see everything in the =
same spot. So yeah, we can flash this. This is on this slide that Rakesh =
was showing and I can flash this if we need to, but I'll try to have Trini =
Vas in here. But it's more of a consolidation effort at this point. So it =
will be done today and we can show this if we need to, but a little bit =
more of what's called formatting work needs to be accomplished.

1:45
Okay. Yeah, let's not flash anything we don't feel is done. So yes, as much=
 as you can do, Jessica would be much appreciated. And if we can discrete, =
if we can differentiate between, like I think Bill said that between daily =
and. Because I think in his mind when I read that, I was thinking rsit, =
higher level plans are done. They are. Now you're going hour by hour, =
you're doing that third level of detail. So making sure you have that =
differentiation with cash when you say that, I think that's going to be =
good. And then I think he's going to have the same comment on the 7th. Why =
is it, I mean, why is the UAT calendar not done until the 27th. Like why do=
 we need seven more days to do something we knew was coming? So explain to =
me that one as well.

2:30
It will be done before then. So what we'll do =
after this is we'll finesse the wording to make that a little bit clearer =
so it doesn't seem like it's as open ended as it seems right now. Does that=
, does that make sense?

2:43
So what. Yeah. What is left? What is left to =
do for the uat?

2:49
Srinivas your file. When do you think UAT will be =
done? Done? I know on the talk yesterday you had a couple more things you =
need to update. Can you ask your answer?

3:04
I'm sorry, could you repeat =
that question?

3:07
Your hourly schedule for due 18. When do you think =
that will be complete? I'm sorry, my apologies. Sid, I.

3:18
No today.

3:20
Okay. All right, so send me over again. I know you sent it to me =
yesterday. Send me over over again where you are. I will pull everything =
that I can before the Jeff call. So in a better state. And we need to just =
clean up the timeline. Rakesh on here. And a little bit of wording to say =
that it's the detailed hourly that we still have open a little bit open =
ended. And the timeline for sit will be today. And the UAT, because you =
said you'll have it completed for UAT today as well. Right?

4:00
UAT might take a couple of hours more, but sit. I'll ensure that you have =
that 500 code number.

4:06
Okay, so put UAT Monday because whenever I can =
update it over the weekend. Perfect.

4:13
Everything needs to be done done=
 by Monday. We can't have another seven days for anything. Everything done =
done. And it means it's going to change. We all know that somebody could be=
 sick, something. So these minor changes are going to happen up until the =
day. Even when we're doing uat, things are going to adjust. So I'm not too =
worried about the changing. What I'm worried about is saying we don't have =
a plan. And so we need to have both, you know, sit. Finalized, finalized =
today. UAT finalized, finalized on Monday. There will be minor changes. He =
understands that. I understand that. Okay, so communication plan. Take off =
the via email because before she even gets started tell the storyline. It =
sounds like our whole strategy is via email. So take just the via email =
after that piece. UAT finalization for that next one will change that date.=
 So both of those dates will be Monday.

5:04
And also mine. Two dates =
changed. Yeah, there you go. Sorry, I just want to make sure we capture =
that there too.

5:09
Perfect. And then the draft status reporting. I would=
 just say status reporting dashboard developed. Like, we don't take off to =
a draft because you're already going to trigger his. Wait a minute. Why are=
 we at draft P. So this is good. Okay, so then if you go to the second. So =
give me one second. We should remove the graph then.

5:29
Yes.

5:29
It's an hourly detail. Calendar developed. SID calendar finalized.

5:35
Okay.

5:36
Yep. Before.

5:36
Before we leave this slide, though, one =
quick one.

5:39
So logistics for on site.

5:40
Can that be 627 or =
segregation would be saying that should be 623 also.

5:46
So logistics for on site. I agree, but that was the same thing. It's just. =
Yes, it's just that one is. What are we trying to communicate there, guys? =
Is it a repeat? It's just on site.

6:00
This is making sure that we have =
lunch, that people can get in. The cars are done. All of that's done. =
That's what we're gonna have Pierce to finalize when he comes back. Yeah, =
can we go to the 24th? Because the only thing is I don't know exactly what =
Pierce did, and I've tried connecting in with.

6:17
Yeah, I think that's fine. 25th, because that's more logistics. Yeah, I =
think that's good. We just want to make sure we.

6:24
Get everybody in the building. Yep.

6:26
No, I'm not sitting on a parking.

6:28
Lot doing our testing.

6:30
It has to be done. It has to be done. =
But. Okay, so sit at the top. Let's just change those dates to make sure =
they align at this slide. So that's fine. No, if you go to that second =
slide. So top portion, change that to the 23rd.

6:53
The other thing I want to call out here is our team is aligned that we can =
have APAC and EMEA start testing. So what we're going to do is we're going =
to have a handoff, if you will, on the July 1st or 2nd. We got to figure =
that out explicitly with the APAC and Maya team. I did Paying Benny just to=
 see if he can help support us in getting NMA Elite.
