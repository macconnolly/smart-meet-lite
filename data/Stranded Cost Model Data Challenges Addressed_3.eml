Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 2, 2025Attendees

   - Matt
   - Corey

Main Topics Discussed1. *Status of Stranded Cost Model*

   - There was confusion regarding the current state of the stranded cost
   model.
   - Arpit provided inconsistent feedback: at one point stating the data
   was adequate but needed revalidation; at another, suggesting a full rebu=
ild
   from scratch was necessary.
   - Matt is tasked with presenting a status view and action plan for the
   stranded cost model, especially identifying gaps and tasks over the next
   three weeks.
   - The base calculation:
      - Starts with corporate allocations (~$52M to Athens, net of TSA).
      - TSA costs are projected for a 6-month period, as expected.
      - Incorporates mitigations from procurement, particularly on licenses
      and contracts.
      - Year One Stranded Cost =3D Allocation =E2=80=93 TSA =E2=80=93 Procu=
rement Mitigations.
      - Example: CCX receives $2.3M annually in allocations; various
      software costs and AI tools are itemized separately.
   - Procurement possesses a presentation (deck) and potentially updated
   contract data that should be reviewed.

2. *Data Challenges and Ownership*

   - Internal and external labor data is particularly lacking:
      - Athens (10% of Honeywell revenue) is assumed to require 10% of
      headcount (~200 people).
      - Uncertainty around the fate of this headcount post-Day One, and how
      much is reallocated.
      - Sourcing this data: HR=E2=80=99s census may be available, but acces=
s is
      restricted; possible HR point of contact mentioned (Arpit J from HR
      Workshop).
      - No standardized process for collecting labor data at the required
      granularity; suggestion to create a data request template.
   - For contracts and licenses, procurement=E2=80=99s data is more complet=
e, but
   needs updating/validation.
   - Hardware build-back costs are less relevant, but stranded capacity on
   servers/firewalls (left behind by Athens) is a concern.
   - Specific functional data owners identified through a whiteboard
   exercise:
      - Labor: Suresh / Siraj
      - Hardware: DCN and DMA workstreams
      - Licensing: Andrew/internal stakeholders
      - Contracts: Procurement

3. *Approach to Data Collection and Model Development*

   - Need to establish a comprehensive view showing what data is available
   vs. missing (=E2=80=9Cwhere we are, where are the gaps=E2=80=9D), pillar=
 by pillar (labor,
   hardware, licenses, contracts).
   - For each app (~300 in total), consider breakdown by TSA disposition:
   live without TSA, under TSA, build-back, etc.
   - Plan to create a view with a clear data gathering plan for each
   combination (app x pillar).
   - Labor data for TSA apps is incomplete and has taken weeks to obtain;
   similar challenges expected for non-TSA apps.
   - Multiple data owners exist; some only have view into subsets of the
   estate.
   - Risk highlighted: likelihood of not obtaining all required data for
   build-back/live without apps within three weeks is low.

4. *Communication and Leadership Frustrations*

   - General dissatisfaction with the lack of actionable direction from
   Rakesh and =E2=80=9Cthe Professor=E2=80=9D (nickname): provides conceptu=
al, high-level
   guidance but little tactical support.
   - Guidance has been abstract and =E2=80=9Cacademic,=E2=80=9D creating co=
nfusion and lack
   of progress for team members.
   - Recommendation/learning: Develop something tangible (even if flawed)
   to drive feedback/concrete direction, rather than waiting for direction.
   - Previous team member (Aaron Juradovic) struggled similarly with
   turning conceptual conversations into deliverables; this has negatively
   affected team members=E2=80=99 perception.

5. *Upcoming In-Person Meetings/Coordination*

   - Discussion on site visits to New York last week and plans this week:
      - Rakesh is in Dallas, Sean in Houston; all plan to travel to
      Charlotte together Tuesday evening.
      - Wednesday=E2=80=93Thursday: planned to work from Honeywell office i=
n
      Charlotte.
      - Lane may be on-site; clarification needed whether at EY or
      Honeywell office.
      - Matt and Corey weighing whether in-person presence in Charlotte
      would expedite alignment and unblock data gathering.

Action Items

   1.

   *Stranded Cost Model View*
   - Matt to build a detailed view/table summarizing for each pillar and
      app disposition:
         - What data is available?
         - What=E2=80=99s missing?
         - Who owns/help collect each data piece?
         - Immediate focus on labor data.
      2.

   *Data Ownership/Collection*
   - Matt/Corey to approach identified data owners (Siraj/Suresh for labor,
      DCN/DMA for hardware, Andrew for licensing, procurement for
contracts) with
      specific, templated data requests.
      - Continuous follow-ups, escalating through Sakai if needed.
   3.

   *Procurement Contract Review*
   - Validate and update contract data with procurement; sync with latest
      deck.
   4.

   *Labor Data Path Forward*
   - Clarify with HR (possibly via Arpit J from HR Workshop) on accessing
      census/headcount data; determine if standardized format can be used f=
or
      suborganization-level reporting.
   5.

   *Schedule Meeting with Rakesh*
   - Review data gaps and get his validation, particularly for labor pillar=
.
   6.

   *Charlotte In-Person Alignment*
   - Consider traveling to Charlotte to directly resolve issues with key
      stakeholders in person (Rakesh, Sean, Lane).
      - Ping Lane about office location for joint working sessions.
   7.

   *Prepare Discussion Inputs*
   - Rather than waiting for further high-level direction, develop draft
      deliverables/views to provide a basis for feedback and force actionab=
le
      discussion.

Follow-Up Points & Next Steps

   - *Check with Lane* about his location/offices in Charlotte for
   coordination.
   - *Touch base with Rakesh* after initial draft of the data view/table is
   ready for feedback.
   - *Monitor progress* on data requests, especially for labor, and
   escalate delays as needed.
   - *Plan for additional escalation* if data owners do not respond within
   the needed timeline.
   - *Assess necessity of continuous in-person presence* based on this
   week=E2=80=99s outcome in Charlotte.

------------------------------

*Risks*

   - Major risk flagged: Labor (internal/external) data for build-back/live
   without applications may not be obtained in the three-week window.
   - Systemic frustration over lack of actionable guidance from senior
   leadership; this could impede progress if not managed by taking the
   initiative.

------------------------------

*Miscellaneous*

   - Lessons shared from previous projects: better to present even
   incomplete work for feedback rather than spinning in ambiguity.
   - Support offered among team members for ongoing brainstorming and
   stress management.

------------------------------

*End of Summary*
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Corey0:00
Thing to discuss. I would be. Would be happy to. Otherwise, I think we can
drop off.
Matt0:07
Okay.
Corey0:12
Okay, thanks, guys. Bye. Bye. Have a good day. All right, bye. All right,
well, yeah, I got a bit of a download from Arpit, as you said earlier.
Matt0:35
Yeah, any. What was his. What was his download? Sometimes I have a hard
time understanding Arpit, so same. I'm so glad it's not just me.
Corey0:49
I have to ask him to repeat himself like half the time. I. I hardly
understand him.
Matt0:53
Okay.
Corey0:53
And talks really fast and I like, I still. I got a download from him, but
like, I don't know, like I, I gave him like a, A list of details, current
status when I left and you know, like, what the next steps were. And it
feels like it was just, you know, at least from like the data gathering on
the, on the TSA and standalone part that nothing really got, nothing really
progressed. So I'm still trying to like, figure that out and see what,
what's left and what, what actually got filled out and whatever. So. Still
trying to understand that this morning.
Matt1:37
Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. And I think that I am somewhat on the hook to provide
a, like a view for the plan for the stranded cost model. So for that, I
mean, from Arpit, it's. It's hard for me to understand where that is at
because he's said to me both that the data that's in the model right now is
fine, it just needs to be revalidated. And then he also said at one point
that it needs to be totally scrapped. The model is good and we kind of need
to start from scratch with pulling in the data. And so that is, I guess my
big fundamental question there is like, where is the stranded cost model
at? Like, the question from Rakesh is like, where are the gaps? And then
what do we need to do over the next three weeks to close that out? Like,
what do we need to drive? Like, what is the game plan? And I really don't
know. I can get there, but I just need a better understanding of what's
been done and what we have and what we don't have, and then I can go. Chase=
.
Corey2:52
Sure, let me pull it up. I'm still trying to get back into work mode this
morning, so give me a minute to pull up the model, refresh my mind on
what's been done on this. So the couple iterations that we've done on the
stranded model, we started with the base of what is the allocation? No,
that's tsa. So the base, the basis of it is basically if we Take corporate
allocations, which is 52 million. This is what corporate allocates to
Athens minus TSAs. That gets you like a day one stranded cost. And our
model shows that, but it shows the TTSA costs for six months, which is what
the anticipated duration is. And then it also adds in some of the
assumptions around what procurement was able to, is able to mitigate, you
know, as far as, you know, licensing and contracts and things like that. So
at a high level, it's what we, what we start with minus TSAs and any
procurement mitigated items gives you your year one stranded cost. And so
what this includes is it starts with whatever the allocation is per tower
and takes out any mitigations they're assuming that will happen in the
first year. So if I take CCX for example, corporate allocates them to 2.3
million annually in costs. And we have, you know, based on the different
applications, if it's Salesforce or other, we have some information on what
the, what, what the Athens cost is. And so for the, for the TSA period, you
know, the TSA mitigation is, you know, we're, we're charging, Honeywell
will charge back Athens this amount for the tsa. And there's also, you
know, some software, software costs in here that are mitigations as well.
So like this one. Let's see. I don't know exactly what the 5000 is, but
it's, I guess, yeah, red. Okay, so that's like the AI tool, I think. But
so, yeah, so basically it's the allocation minus any data we have on
contracts from the work stream and the current TSA assumption what will be
compelled back to Athens. And so we have this input here. We have some
assumptions for those based on what procurement has provided. And you know,
that's what, that's what's getting our strand of cost. So I guess like
that's our current state. Our next step would be to, you know, look, look
at this again with procurement. So maybe with Android Mu, we look back at
the data that we use to, to get here. So there are, they have a deck where
they have this information. And so it may have been updated or there may be
a new status for these. So we need to go look, look again at what these are
and make sure that we have the right data or if there's been any updates in
what they have provided originally on contracts.
Matt7:07
Yeah, so contracts, that's great. A little bit less worried about contracts
because the data is there. The one that I guess stuck out at me was the
internal and external labor. Yeah, like there's the, there's these five
pillars. Right. It's like labor, internal and external contracts, licenses
and I don't know, depreciation or something else. Right. Like, and labor
was the one that stuck out at me because I'm not sure how much data is
there. Do you know that they have?
Corey7:48
Yeah, like the whole concept with internal labor is that with Athens being
4 billion in revenue or 10% of revenue, they would also need to account for
10% of the Honeywell corporate IT headcount. And 10%, that is about 200, a
little over 200 people. And so what is going to happen with 200 people on
day one to mitigate the stranded cost for headcount? So obviously some
people are going to move to Athens, but not 200. So there's like there's
that piece and then there's a piece that will be reallocated to other
projects and things like that. So like we, I, I don't have like a good view
on what that is. We've talked about it a couple times, but I don't have
like a what, what exactly that's going to look like on day one. So that's
something that, yeah. For labor needs to be aligned on, with, with, with
Rakesh and, and the client.
Matt8:58
Who would you go to on the like, is there a census floating around? Like is
this like an HR question or is this going to be like a, like a per tower
question? Like for ccex, do you go to them and ask about their labor or do
you go to HR and say hey, can you pull the records for all of the people
assigned to this sub org and work it backwards that way? Or can you just
send out a data request to somebody like come up with a template and say,
hey, this is the information that we need like some sort of standardized
format for labor and just send it around?
Corey9:47
Yeah, I think the data from HR may be available. As far as like a census
goes, it's locked down pretty tightly. Yeah, I haven't seen it yet, but
Arpit J from HR Workshop may have more insight into the census, but I think
more it's, you know, let me, let me just get back to you on what, what we
talked about last, what I talked to Rakesh about last time. I need to go
back in my notes and see what we had kind of ended on. Not ended on, but
just what we had discussed last time because I'm, I know it's a question
mark that needs to be resolved, but I don't, can't Remember what we had
settled on or kind of talked about for the next step. So let me, let me
just get back to you on that one.
Matt10:47
So I'm gonna send you a picture because I was grilling him. We were in New
York last week and I was grilling him about this. Yeah, Rakesh.
Corey10:55
Oh yeah.
Matt10:56
So he didn't, I don't think he knows, honestly, like I don't think he knows
how to do it.
Corey11:02
Well. I mean I, I don't have an idea if he doesn't because I was, I was
gonna look up what he had told me.
Matt11:08
Like. Yeah, I don't think that he knows really where to get it. Like he was
kind of like vague. He was kind of vague in his explanation of it. He asked
for the view that I sent to you to sort of summarize like where we're at,
which is like for the different pillars, I guess, like labor, hardware,
software licensing. And I don't know what that last one is. What do we have
and what do we need? Like where are the gaps? He said, imagine there's 300
apps like 100 live without 100 TSA 70, build back 30. I don't know what the
last one is, but for each of those try to come up with like what do we have
and what do we need and what will we need? So the nas, we don't need that
data. Probably like there's not going to be hardware build back costs for
example, but we have the data for software build backs, we just need to
validate it and we still need labor internal and external for like the
build back app. So he was talking about doing it to like at the app level
basically like by the TSA disposition of the apps.
Corey12:26
Huh?
Matt12:29
Yeah, that was basically his suggestion.
Corey12:32
Okay, now if that's the case, I mean ideally with this stranded with a
standalone cost, we should have like you said, the build back, you know,
move as is costs with those by completing that exercise. We don't have that
yet but you know, the idea is that we do have it soon and so we could pump
those into the model and set it up where we can have those like line item
lab, you know, or just pull from the same source or something to get those
numbers so that for like build back apps or you know, app support and aqua
licensing, we should have that.
Matt13:19
Yeah. Did you see that picture I messaged you?
Corey13:24
The one from International Paper?
Matt13:28
No, I just sent it on teams. It's like a screenshot or it's a whiteboard
drawing.
Corey13:34
Oh, sorry, let me go back.
Matt13:35
No, you're good. Sorry I sent it directly to you.
Corey13:39
Oh, I was. Sorry. I had. My wires had crossed. It was something from
someone else that on stranded cost that I was against. Let me get back.
Yeah, let's see. Okay, here we go. Ah, okay.
Matt13:52
And he said from storage I guess is that person's name. Storage will
probably be able to get us the labor costs because they were doing is was
it just ccex. It was like one bucket. But it seemed like they had labor for
everything internal and external. And then I don't know what he wrote above
hardware software. I can't decipher it. D.C. v. Oh, I guess those are the
subwork streams. I guess they're like there's.
Corey14:30
I think it's DCN and DMA or like database management.
Matt14:34
Yeah. So he said go to those like work streams for. For the hardware
software data or hardware data. Go to DC and DMA for the hardware data. Go
to Siraj for labor and then Andrew and our internal folks for licensing and
whatever that last one is.
Corey15:06
Contract.
Matt15:07
Yeah, contract contracts. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Corey15:11
Okay. I mean and I guess like that.
Matt15:14
Would be the game plan.
Corey15:16
Okay. So for sure as right now he has provided a pretty messy view of
incomplete view of labor costs for tsa. There's some, there's some emails
going back and forth to like get that cleaned up because a lot of it is
like it's incomplete or not. Not accurate from what it seems.
Matt15:46
Doesn't make sense.
Corey15:47
So that TSA line for labor is. Okay, we could, we could say we almost have
that but we, we haven't gotten anything for build back and especially not
for live without because that's kind of been you know, separate from any
like Athens day one costing exercise. So those, those we need to request I
guess from, from Suresh on those.
Matt16:15
Okay.
Corey16:16
And for dcn for the hardware. DCN and database hardware costs. We do, you
know they're working on a view for TSA and I'm wondering why build back and
move as is our NA for hardware?
Matt16:41
I guess because it's gonna be Athens cost. Right?
Corey16:47
Yeah, right, right. Yeah.
Matt16:50
But it could leave something stranded like if there's a server or
something. Right. On the Honeywell side you do build back for an app and
then whatever server it was sitting on or like maybe like a firewall, like
a Palo Alto firewall or something.
Corey17:06
Right, right. If they're going to build their own and it's currently hosted
there, there's going to be excess capacity or something.
Matt17:13
Exactly.
Corey17:19
Yeah. So I mean we do have, we do have it, you know, so we have, we're
going to have the day one hosting costs or, you know, the hardware cost for
dcn. So we will have those as an input. But that's like from an Athens
perspective, I guess. For like if we. I'm just thinking through hardware.
So for just looking at servers, for example, and there's, you know, 100
servers right now it's support and 20 of those support Athens. And now
Athens isn't off of those. Like what, what's the cost of those, Those,
those annual servers. I, I don't know if we have that. I'm trying to think
if we've. Where we get that.
Matt18:12
Yeah. But I think like the first step is probably for me to just build this
view and then we can get the double clicks and come up with a true plan,
like for the underlying data here. So for each one of these, basically. So
for 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3. So there's gonna be like 12 lines. Right. For each
one of these boxes, it's like, what's the plan to get? So for labor? Lw.
Corey18:41
Yeah.
Matt18:41
Yeah. We need the data and what's the plan to get it?
Corey18:47
What's that, what's the column that says 300 on the left?
Matt18:51
Those. That's like he was like approximating the, like the count of apps.
Corey18:55
Oh, okay.
Matt18:57
He was saying like there's 300 apps, maybe 100 live without. He was just
making up numbers just to give it some meaning.
Corey19:02
Yeah, yeah, makes sense. Okay.
Matt19:04
And then I guess day one, pre day one. Day one, Day one. I don't know what
the implication of day one is or pre. Day one for this.
Corey19:20
Let's see. Sift. Labor, Day one. Labor. Yeah, I don't know. Okay. Yeah,
yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I think. Yeah, I'm with you here Getting,
getting this view together on what we need and where we're at with each of
them is that makes sense. And I'm trying to think. So like I showed on the,
on the model, we're using a baseline of those allocations. I'm guessing the
baseline would be replaced by all this data.
Matt20:08
Yep.
Corey20:11
And then.
Matt20:11
And I think that's what Arpit meant when he said scrap. It was replace the
baseline allocated estimates with this. We probably would like lock this
model, duplicate it and then track the variance against.
Corey20:29
Yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, I would imagine so. Yeah. Okay. Yeah,
yeah, I'm with you here. I, I think that makes sense to me.
Matt20:44
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at. So I'm going to try and put this view
together when I get some time today and then review with Rakesh and
hopefully he'll have some more like granular suggestions for the labor
piece. Especially if it is. I think that he was optimistic that Sarah C.
Whoever that guy is, would, yeah. Would have good data for us. But if he
doesn't.
Corey21:13
Oh man. So like he provided us some data on TSA only applications and it's,
it's, it's spotty and took weeks to get. And so we have to go back to him
and say not only do we need it for the TSA applications, clean up the TSA
applications, also we need the live without everything else.
Matt21:37
Yeah, right.
Corey21:38
And he, he's only, so he has a counterpart that's, you know, well, there's,
he's only over certain workshops streams like data and intelligence and
there's another one that he does not have insight into. He just has data
for certain work streams and so there's another person that we need to
contact for those. But judging by how long it took us it took him to get
the 70 applications for TSA and his work streams, it's going to take him a
bit longer to get us the other stuff. But I don't see, I don't see how else
we would get it. So I mean that's, I think that's the course of action. But
in three weeks, that's, that's a risk. It's a risk. Yeah. I'm not
optimistic that we'll get that. But you know, he's aware of that too. I
mean, he sees the data, he knows that we've been following up and asking
and asking and asking for this. So I think with, I know he's escalating to
Sakai on the data like he has been, she's reached out and, and kind of
pushed people before on these, on these topics. So I don't know if he's,
he's going to join today, but it would be good to get alignment or just,
you know, make sure we're all on the same page on the data collection.
Because I like, I've been pushing on this for a few weeks now and I was
hoping that we'd get some closure on some of these. This past week it
doesn't look like that happened. And so that's a big risk to not only
stranded, but you know, to these other more immediate deliverables of
standalone and TSA costing. So yeah, I think I'm stranded and we just need
to get Rakesh to kind of validate that, I guess.
Matt23:33
Okay. Yeah, sounds great.
Corey23:37
Cool. How was it? How was it last week in New York?
Matt23:40
It was good. It was good, I think. I don't know. It's just like I showed up
and it didn't seem like Rakesh had any idea what I was going to be doing.
So he was of coming up with it on the fly. But it sounds like it's going to
be pretty heavily involved with UAT and the BRV stuff until that ramps down
and then continuing to balance that with this.
Corey24:08
Yeah.
Matt24:09
Okay, so that's the plan.
Corey24:12
Yeah. And in full, I'll be brief here. I, I don't know if he's going to
join or not. But in full transparency, I think my experience with, with him
has been at the end of the day, he says stuff to me at least, and Aaron,
who was previous on the project, it seems like a lot is said but not a lot
of real guidance is given.
Matt24:40
Exactly.
Corey24:40
And so I end up spinning because he says stuff and I try to like figure out
what that means, but it doesn't really give me any real direction on what
to do next. Yes, it's high level conceptual instead of like actionable.
Matt24:55
Exactly. Like all of this was a very good, like conceptual lesson in how to
do costing, but none of it actually helped me get closer to what's the game
plan. Like I have no fucking clue. But the. I don't know. They call him the
professor, which I think is hilarious.
Corey25:13
Oh, is that his nickname?
Matt25:15
Yes, the Professor.
Corey25:18
Academic.
Matt25:19
Yeah.
Corey25:19
That makes a lot of sense. I think that's a consensus then because like I,
I feel like I work with them sometimes I leave more confused. Sometimes
it's like more convoluted than when I started.
Matt25:29
Yeah.
Corey25:30
But generally like we'll talk through something and nothing changes or
nothing. Like there's no progress on anything. It's just like hypothetical.
Matt25:41
Exactly. And I think I sort of. My lesson from last week was just like get
something down and then go to him and like, I have to create sort of my own
direction because involving him is just gonna slow me down and I'm gonna
get to the same end result anyway.
Corey25:59
Yeah, yeah. And I've honestly struggled with that on this project. Yeah.
It's looked poorly on me, which I'm like having a hard time with it,
honestly.
Matt26:13
So that's a, I mean, that's a good lesson. My last project was like that I
was working with Anthony Lockley. I don't know if you've worked with him,
but he's out of New York and it was the same thing. But Rakesh is pretty
mild mannered. Anthony is like a very explosive person and he said a lot of
words, but I ended up just spinning my wheels and I think that it reflected
poorly on me and that was a very good lesson in just like getting something
down or getting anything done. Like something is better than nothing and
even if it's totally wrong, it at least gives them something to look at and
like.
Corey26:51
Yeah, yeah. He. It's. Yeah. I think to that point, may. Anthony's the same
way. They need something to react to.
Matt26:57
Yeah.
Corey26:57
To give guidance on instead of like just in the clouds, like talking about
it. So if you have something it gives. It gives like something tangible to.
Matt27:05
Exactly. Yeah. Yep, exactly. Well, if you ever need someone to bounce ideas
off of or just talk things through, even if I'm not involved, please always
feel free to give me a call.
Corey27:16
Yeah, I appreciate that.
Matt27:18
Yeah. I'm here for you.
Corey27:20
Yeah. Thank you. And you know Aaron Juradovic, who was on the project, we
worked together a lot on costing and he got booted, I think, for this.
Right. Like, I don't think he or we were able to like you put you solidify
any conceptual ideas that, that we, we were given.
Matt27:45
Yeah.
Corey27:46
And move forward with it. So we ended up spinning for. For a few weeks and
that. That's where it landed him. So.
Matt27:54
Well, costing is hard.
Corey27:56
Sorry.
Matt27:57
Costing is hard in general.
Corey28:00
Yeah. So, yeah, just like. Yeah. Spitballing it or like talking about like
how it's done isn't going to help you. It needs to be like something on
paper and moving forward with it, making progress instead of just talking
about it. So.
Matt28:13
Yeah, like tactical. Like do this there, use this for that. Like, have you
tried this? And that and the other thing instead of pontificating. Are you
going to be in. Are you going to Charlotte this week?
Corey28:26
I haven't, you know, I, I've seen some chats on it, but I haven't spoken
with Rakesh since I've been back. I. As of right now, I'm not planning on
it, but that could certainly change today. Yeah. And if it sounds like I
may, I may have to. To get in front of him or whoever to make sure that,
you know, we're making progress on the other costing deliverables.
Matt28:54
Yeah. Corner them. So Rakesh is in Dallas today dealing with. We'll talk
about that in person. But he's in Dallas today and Sean is in Houston. And
so all three of us planned to arrive tomorrow evening and then spend
Wednesday and Thursday in the office at Honeywell.
Corey29:17
Got it. Okay.
Matt29:19
That was our plan for right now.
Corey29:21
Okay.
Matt29:21
But I think Lane is going to go and I'm not sure if he's. I don't think
he's going into the Honeywell office. I would ping Lane cuz he was pinging
me last night and I'm not sure if he's going into the Honeywell office or
the EY office. It sounded like he wanted to go into ey, so we could always
do like one day in UI and one day at Honeywell too.
Corey29:40
Yeah, okay.
Matt29:41
But if you want to get in front of them, that's where they're going to be.
Corey29:44
Yeah, I think that's, that's a good idea now and seeing if that makes sense
to him. But yeah, that, that, that, that certainly seems like that might
need to be the case. Yeah, I, I think if it's not, then it's going to
continue to be muddled and abstract.
Matt30:02
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Corey30:03
Okay, cool.
Matt30:04
Corey. Well, I'll let you go, but thank you so much for the rundown.
Corey30:08
Yeah, I'm glad we're on the same page with it. I know. I think we're both
confused a little bit, so.
Matt30:12
Yeah, yeah, we'll figure it out.
Corey30:14
All right. Yeah, that makes sense. All right, we'll touch base later, but
yeah, sounds good.
Matt30:18
Cool. Thanks, man. Welcome back. Take it easy.
Corey30:20
Yeah, thanks, Matt.
Matt30:21
Thanks.
Corey30:21
Bye.

ong></h3><ul>
<li>There was confusion regarding the current state of the stranded cost mo=
del.</li>
<li>Arpit provided inconsistent feedback: at one point stating the data was=
 adequate but needed revalidation; at another, suggesting a full rebuild fr=
om scratch was necessary.</li>
<li>Matt is tasked with presenting a status view and action plan for the st=
randed cost model, especially identifying gaps and tasks over the next thre=
e weeks.</li>
<li>The base calculation:<ul>
<li>Starts with corporate allocations (~$52M to Athens, net of TSA).</li>
<li>TSA costs are projected for a 6-month period, as expected.</li>
<li>Incorporates mitigations from procurement, particularly on licenses and=
 contracts.</li>
<li>Year One Stranded Cost =3D Allocation =E2=80=93 TSA =E2=80=93 Procureme=
nt Mitigations.</li>
<li>Example: CCX receives $2.3M annually in allocations; various software c=
osts and AI tools are itemized separately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procurement possesses a presentation (deck) and potentially updated con=
tract data that should be reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">2. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Data Challenges and Ownership</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Internal and external labor data is particularly lacking:<ul>
<li>Athens (10% of Honeywell revenue) is assumed to require 10% of headcoun=
t (~200 people).</li>
<li>Uncertainty around the fate of this headcount post-Day One, and how muc=
h is reallocated.</li>
<li>Sourcing this data: HR=E2=80=99s census may be available, but access is=
 restricted; possible HR point of contact mentioned (Arpit J from HR Worksh=
op).</li>
<li>No standardized process for collecting labor data at the required granu=
larity; suggestion to create a data request template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For contracts and licenses, procurement=E2=80=99s data is more complete=
, but needs updating/validation.</li>
<li>Hardware build-back costs are less relevant, but stranded capacity on s=
ervers/firewalls (left behind by Athens) is a concern.</li>
<li>Specific functional data owners identified through a whiteboard exercis=
e:<ul>
<li>Labor: Suresh / Siraj</li>
<li>Hardware: DCN and DMA workstreams</li>
<li>Licensing: Andrew/internal stakeholders</li>
<li>Contracts: Procurement</li>
</ul>

 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Approach to Data Collection and Model Developme=
nt</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Need to establish a comprehensive view showing what data is available v=
s. missing (=E2=80=9Cwhere we are, where are the gaps=E2=80=9D), pillar by =
pillar (labor, hardware, licenses, contracts).</li>
<li>For each app (~300 in total), consider breakdown by TSA disposition: li=
ve without TSA, under TSA, build-back, etc.</li>
<li>Plan to create a view with a clear data gathering plan for each combina=
tion (app x pillar).</li>
<li>Labor data for TSA apps is incomplete and has taken weeks to obtain; si=
milar challenges expected for non-TSA apps.</li>
<li>Multiple data owners exist; some only have view into subsets of the est=
ate.</li>
<li>Risk highlighted: likelihood of not obtaining all required data for bui=
ld-back/live without apps within three weeks is low.</li>
</ul>

<li>General dissatisfaction with the lack of actionable direction from Rake=

<li>Guidance has been abstract and =E2=80=9Cacademic,=E2=80=9D creating con=

 like it was just, you know, at least from like the data gathering on the, =
on the TSA and standalone part that nothing really got, nothing really prog=
ressed. So I&#39;m still trying to like, figure that out and see what, what=
&#39;s left and what, what actually got filled out and whatever. So. Still =
trying to understand that this morning.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bot=

I am somewhat on the hook to provide a, like a view for the plan for the st=
randed cost model. So for that, I mean, from Arpit, it&#39;s. It&#39;s hard=
 for me to understand where that is at because he&#39;s said to me both tha=
t the data that&#39;s in the model right now is fine, it just needs to be r=
evalidated. And then he also said at one point that it needs to be totally =
scrapped. The model is good and we kind of need to start from scratch with =
pulling in the data. And so that is, I guess my big fundamental question th=
ere is like, where is the stranded cost model at? Like, the question from R=
akesh is like, where are the gaps? And then what do we need to do over the =
next three weeks to close that out? Like, what do we need to drive? Like, w=
hat is the game plan? And I really don&#39;t know. I can get there, but I j=
ust need a better understanding of what&#39;s been done and what we have an=
d what we don&#39;t have, and then I can go. Chase.</div></div><div style=

yle=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Sure, let me pull it u=
p. I&#39;m still trying to get back into work mode this morning, so give me=
 a minute to pull up the model, refresh my mind on what&#39;s been done on =
this. So the couple iterations that we&#39;ve done on the stranded model, w=
e started with the base of what is the allocation? No, that&#39;s tsa. So t=
he base, the basis of it is basically if we Take corporate allocations, whi=
ch is 52 million. This is what corporate allocates to Athens minus TSAs. Th=
at gets you like a day one stranded cost. And our model shows that, but it =
shows the TTSA costs for six months, which is what the anticipated duration=
 is. And then it also adds in some of the assumptions around what procureme=
nt was able to, is able to mitigate, you know, as far as, you know, licensi=
ng and contracts and things like that. So at a high level, it&#39;s what we=
, what we start with minus TSAs and any procurement mitigated items gives y=
ou your year one stranded cost. And so what this includes is it starts with=
 whatever the allocation is per tower and takes out any mitigations they&#3=
9;re assuming that will happen in the first year. So if I take CCX for exam=
ple, corporate allocates them to 2.3 million annually in costs. And we have=
, you know, based on the different applications, if it&#39;s Salesforce or =
other, we have some information on what the, what, what the Athens cost is.=
 And so for the, for the TSA period, you know, the TSA mitigation is, you k=
now, we&#39;re, we&#39;re charging, Honeywell will charge back Athens this =
amount for the tsa. And there&#39;s also, you know, some software, software=
 costs in here that are mitigations as well. So like this one. Let&#39;s se=
e. I don&#39;t know exactly what the 5000 is, but it&#39;s, I guess, yeah, =
red. Okay, so that&#39;s like the AI tool, I think. But so, yeah, so basica=
lly it&#39;s the allocation minus any data we have on contracts from the wo=
rk stream and the current TSA assumption what will be compelled back to Ath=
ens. And so we have this input here. We have some assumptions for those bas=
ed on what procurement has provided. And you know, that&#39;s what, that&#3=
9;s what&#39;s getting our strand of cost. So I guess like that&#39;s our c=
urrent state. Our next step would be to, you know, look, look at this again=
 with procurement. So maybe with Android Mu, we look back at the data that =
we use to, to get here. So there are, they have a deck where they have this=
 information. And so it may have been updated or there may be a new status =
for these. So we need to go look, look again at what these are and make sur=
e that we have the right data or if there&#39;s been any updates in what th=
ey have provided originally on contracts.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-b=

 account for 10% of the Honeywell corporate IT headcount. And 10%, that is =
about 200, a little over 200 people. And so what is going to happen with 20=
0 people on day one to mitigate the stranded cost for headcount? So obvious=
ly some people are going to move to Athens, but not 200. So there&#39;s lik=
e there&#39;s that piece and then there&#39;s a piece that will be realloca=
ted to other projects and things like that. So like we, I, I don&#39;t have=
 like a good view on what that is. We&#39;ve talked about it a couple times=

one is, but for each of those try to come up with like what do we have and =
what do we need and what will we need? So the nas, we don&#39;t need that d=

r example, but we have the data for software build backs, we just need to v=
