*Cost Gathering and Application License Review Meeting*
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Review of Software Application Licenses & Costs

   -

   *ANSYS & Team Center:*
   - Uncertainty regarding usage extent for ANSYS modules.
      - Only required modules will be purchased (not all 30=E2=80=9350).
      - Cost details for both ANSYS and Team Center expected next week.
   -

   *Seal Licensing & Aspen Costs:*
   - Seal licensing costs are available today.
      - Aspen licenses being transferred for year one; subsequent years
      (2=E2=80=935) will incur annual fees.
      - Aspen cost information will also be provided today.
   -

   *Accolade Licensing:*
   - Initial cost to be provided; renewal initiated early to obtain
      Honeywell discount under TSA (Transition Service Agreement).
      - Without renewing, a separate provider/support would be needed in
      December, leading to organizational separation=E2=80=94which is not p=
referred
      currently.
      - Accolade's continued use is under evaluation; alternatives are
      being considered.
   -

   *Documentum:*
   - Costs are still being investigated; team has shared cabinets and data
      lists.
      - Documentum may remain under TSA, as its day-two status is uncertain
      and alternatives are being explored due to user dissatisfaction.
      - Potential transition and upgrade considerations if Documentum is
      retained, potentially needing a major migration sooner.
      - Gautam and Karen are the main contacts for Documentum cost
      information.
   -

   *Other Applications:*
   - Homegrown tools (e.g., Ballistics app) have no external licensing
      costs.
      - Confluence, Jira, and LabWorks: Costs and support status are being
      verified.
      - LabWorks consists of three separate instances on three servers;
      internal and possibly external/vendor support contracts
exist=E2=80=94this will be
      checked for costs.
      - PTC Creo licenses (~$50K each), with transition to SolidWorks
      planned after current licenses expire due to cost savings and
      simplification.

2. Data Entry, Inventory, and Coordination

   -

   *Data Sources & Validation:*
   - Cost data is pulled from an application inventory (possibly via
      volumetric data).
      - Need to validate quantities (e.g., for PTC Creo, three licenses
      required for day one).
      - Many fields are pre-populated; outstanding blanks or =E2=80=9CTBD=
=E2=80=9D fields
      will be filled or corrected as information is confirmed.
   -

   *Document Collaboration:*
   - Gary will directly populate the shared document with updated costs and
      license values.
      - Matt will send the document link and notes on the existing
      sorting/filters used.

3. Decision Points & Next Steps

   -

   *Application Dispositions:*
   - For tools where retention is uncertain (e.g., Accolade, Documentum),
      TSA will be used as a provisional status.
      - For TSA applications, current costs are prioritized; post-TSA costs
      are subject to change with potential solution swaps.
   -

   *Outstanding Actions:*
   - Gary to review and populate missing or uncertain cost/license fields
      in the shared document by today.
      - Confirm vendor support status and costs, especially for
      applications like LabWorks.
      - Continue evaluating alternative solutions for critical applications
      where user satisfaction is low.

------------------------------
Action Items & Follow-Ups

   1. *Gary* to complete and update the cost/licensing fields in the
   inventory document.
   2. *Matt* to send the link to the cost-tracking document (sorted by
   =E2=80=98final align day=E2=80=99 and filtered for business units as nee=
ded).
   3. *Documentum* cost and ownership (reach out to Gautam/Karen if needed)=
.
   4. *LabWorks* support contract verification.
   5. *Aspen and Seal* licensing costs to be provided to the team today.
   6. *Ongoing:* Continue data gathering for ANSYS and Team Center; revisit
   next week.
   7. *Strategic:* Assess and decide on long-term retention vs. replacement
   for Documentum and Accolade.

------------------------------
Additional Notes

   - Decision-making on several applications is still in process, with
   alternatives being actively considered.
   - Accurate and current cost data will drive further procurement and
   migration planning, especially for TSA and post-TSA scenarios.
   - Collaboration and ownership identified for follow-up on applications
   with missing or unclear data.
   - The meeting closed with confirmation on next steps and contact points
   for any issues with data collection.

Gary0:00
You are now connected. You can merge your calls when ready. And I'm not
sure yet. Yeah, I'm not sure if that person was just playing with it
because it was available to see what it did or if they were actually using
it, if they were using it to what extent. So there's still some data we're
gathering because, you know, there's the ansys has what, 30, 40, 50
modules, however many it is, and we don't want to buy them all. We only
want to buy the ones we actually need. It doesn't make sense for us to
purchase them all. We're doing the same thing with Team Center. So those
two, I probably won't have the cost nailed down for you till next week on
those two. The seal licensing I can get you today. I've got those.
Matt0:46
Okay.
Gary0:47
Yeah. And. And the aspen costs, I've got, you know, the aspen cost, it's
going to transfer the license to us for year one and then we just have have
annual license fees from year two, three, four, five. So I can get you that
today as well. Let me think. And the accolade I can get you. Because
accolade will be under tsa. I can get you the initial cost. They're making
us go ahead and renew the license for solstice early because to get the
Honeywell discount and get Honeywell tsa otherwise come December because of
the vendor, we would have to buy our own provider, own support and
basically be physically separated. And I don't know that we're ready for
that. So I'm still knowing accolade down as well now. The rest of them,
document them. We're just now getting into the costing with those guys.
We've shared a list of what we think are the cabinets, you know, and the
data that needs to be there. And, and again, you know, I think document
them is going to be TSA for a while because we're not sure we're going to
use it on day two. That's still up in there as well because some of these.
We're looking for alternative solutions. I can tell you. Accolade, we're
looking for an alternative solution. You know, Documentum, we're looking
for an alternative solution because the people don't like those solutions
for various reasons. And so. But I don't think they realize like in
Documentum how big of a transition that's going to be. But we'll get to
that as we're looking. So. But I can get you estimates on what it would be
at least through TSA and You know, I can get you a proposed cost post tsa,
but again, if we're switching the, if we're switching the solution out,
that won't be fully accurate.
Matt2:39
Yeah, understood, understood. And I'm sharing my screen here. So for the
TSA applications I have.
Gary2:46
For.
Matt2:49
For engineering, I have costs. The costs have been populated, I think by,
I'm trying to see who.
Gary2:56
Probably Doris's team.
Matt2:58
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we have some of these for the tsa. So let's see, we
have actually Documentum is the only one missing and I have a Gautam I
think is someone who, yes is responsible for this. That Kieran, I think
Karen's name is here perhaps.
Gary3:16
Yeah, Karen can help. Karen can help as well. Either one.
Matt3:21
Oh yeah. So yeah, Bars. I think Barth is on the email along with a guy
Gotham that is, you know, I'm trying to get their.
Gary3:28
Support and that's who we're working with to try to get costs too because
we're like I say, we're looking at what the cost is going to be on the
other side as well.
Matt3:37
Yeah, yeah.
Gary3:38
You know, because to be honest with you, document them. If we decide we're
going to keep it, we're going to probably push to go ahead and upgrade the
version to the latest and greatest and migrate it and maybe do it before
day one if we're, if we're going to keep it. But the reason we put it under
TSA is we're not sure we're keeping it. Yeah, that's why we put it under
tsa. So we still got some decisions to make.
Matt4:05
Yeah. And in that case, I mean a TBD is fine if we don't have like the cost
yet or if it's still okay. A decision to make for TSAs, you know, just like
the current cost is what we need. But for the.
Gary4:17
I can give you some of these now. So for for example, in ballistics I saw a
TBD somewhere.
Matt4:23
Yeah.
Gary4:24
The license cost on that 1, 0. Because that's a homegrown application.
Matt4:28
Okay. And so there's a couple, let's see. Zero.
Gary4:33
Yeah, yeah, that's zero. Let me see. Confluence and Jira, I can get for
you. Lab works. Yeah, go ahead.
Matt4:44
Yeah, just for context. So I think this data is pulled in from the
application inventory from volumetric data.
Gary4:53
Okay.
Matt4:54
So we have this data but I'm not sure exactly, you know what it means like
if it's license quantity is needed is three for PTC Creo.
Gary5:05
It is, that's correct. But PTC Creole is Only going to be for day one. Once
the license cost expire, we will have them migrated to SolidWorks. So
we're. Yeah, it's good. We're. We're moving everybody from PTC Creel to
SolidWorks. It's a lot cheaper and there's no reason to have a couple of
different solutions.
Matt5:24
Yeah, I gotcha. Okay. For these, I mean, I have, there's a, there's a
license quantity and a price. I don't. Is it 50k license? I'm not sure.
Gary5:33
Yeah, that's basically what it is.
Matt5:35
Okay.
Gary5:35
Which is crazy. I know.
Matt5:37
Yeah, That's a lot. That's a lot. But yeah, if that's the case, then great.
I mean, I can, it looks, you know, I can't do the math here, but if you,
if, if you can either confirm these values are correct and, you know, fill
in the blanks, that's awesome. It feels like a lot of these are in here and
then there's a few that are either unknown or, you know, zero. So.
Gary5:58
Okay, got it.
Matt6:01
Great. Yeah, I can. Yeah. And if you have, if you have some of these off
the top of your head, great. We can, we can walk through them. If not, you
know, I think you have the, this document. I'll just resend you the link
and if you can help us populate, that's great.
Gary6:17
Sure. Yeah, I'll go in there today and start populating.
Matt6:20
Okay, cool.
Gary6:21
It's probably easier for me to just go populate and send it to you to
populate. I can go ahead and populate it for you.
Matt6:26
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, you know the ins and outs a lot better
than I do, so. Okay, sounds like a plan. I appreciate your help, Gary. I'll
send, I'll send this the link over and kind of. Yeah, it's, it's the. I
have it sorted and it's probably going to keep the sort on here, but I have
it sorted by final align day. You know, day one, disposition as build back
or move as is.
Gary6:51
Okay.
Matt6:52
Like we talked about, all the TSAs I think are covered. And then I have.
And you tell me. I mean, I have these, I have it filtered by business
scope, but if I take out those, we have still quite a list of. Well, I
mean, Aspen is in here, so that's obviously that needs to be unfiltered, I
think. Right. So all these are build backs. And you know, you may know
better than I do, but we have like three here for lab works which are.
Gary7:20
Yeah, those are three different instances.
Matt7:22
Okay.
Gary7:22
Lab works. So we We've got. It's one application, but we've got three
different instances on three different servers. And yeah, those are
basically supported in house. But I, and I've got to check. I'm not sure
because Steve's been handling those, but I think some of those we've got
support contracts with the vendor, you know, some of them we don't. So I've
got to double check and see what the cost is.
Matt7:47
Okay. Alrighty.
Gary7:51
Yeah, Anything blank that I see, this blank that I know is going, I'll go
ahead and change for you too.
Matt7:56
Okay, awesome. Now? Yeah, so I think there's several in here. If these are,
you know, these are formulas coming in from, from the inventory. If you can
either, like for anything, that's. If you want to just copy the value or
write like matches.
Gary8:13
Right. I can do that.
Matt8:14
Yeah.
Gary8:14
In the blue. Yeah, I got it.
Matt8:16
Just to confirm those. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Alrighty. Gary, well, thank
you. I appreciate you doing that. I'll. I'll look for, you know, I'll keep
this tab open, but you know, if there's any issues getting any, any data,
let me know and we can chat about it again. But I'll.
Gary8:34
Okay, absolutely.
Matt8:36
Alrighty. Thank you, sir.
Gary8:37
Thank you. Have a good afternoon. Hey, Matt. Good to meet you. Nice to meet
you as well. Okay. You have a great day.
Matt8:43
Yeah.

go ahead and renew the license for solstice early because to get the Honeyw=

a that needs to be there. And, and again, you know, I think document them i=

 use it on day two. That&#39;s still up in there as well because some of th=
ese. We&#39;re looking for alternative solutions. I can tell you. Accolade,=
 we&#39;re looking for an alternative solution. You know, Documentum, we&#3=
9;re looking for an alternative solution because the people don&#39;t like =
those solutions for various reasons. And so. But I don&#39;t think they rea=
lize like in Documentum how big of a transition that&#39;s going to be. But=
 we&#39;ll get to that as we&#39;re looking. So. But I can get you estimate=
s on what it would be at least through TSA and You know, I can get you a pr=
oposed cost post tsa, but again, if we&#39;re switching the, if we&#39;re s=
witching the solution out, that won&#39;t be fully accurate.</div></div><di=
