You are now connected. You can merge your calls when ready. Hey, Will.

0:44
Hey, Max. How's it going, man?

0:46
Hey. How are you? Hey.

0:48
Pretty good. Pretty good. Just landed home.

0:50
Good. Did you. Where did =
you fly out of?

0:53
New Jersey. So I'm very glad I got out today.

0:56
Yeah. I'm impressed that you got out. It was a mess last Monday and =
Thursday when I was trying to go back.

1:07
Yeah.

1:08
I'm glad you got back. So tell me. I'm really curious. Tell me all about it=
.

1:15
This is something I've been working on for a while, and I was =
saying it's basically going to their dual practice, right? The same thing, =
basically. Do you remember Rom?

1:26
Yeah.

1:27
Yeah. There's, like, =
Kieran. That's where those guys went.

1:31
Yeah, I know. Kieran went.

1:34
Okay. So same practice. I think I've kind of joined them. And then I =
have the ability to consider breaking folks with. With me.

1:45
Yeah.

1:46
Basically, it's like a. Some think about it as kind of like a, you =
know, it's for a, you know, every voucher. Right. So it's just a matter of =
have a conversation, you know, ask you for. For, you know, what your =
current is. Right. And. Or what you're told to make and all that kind of =
stuff. Right. They'll definitely make sure to give you a, you know, a =
decent bump. Right. Versus what you have today.

2:17
Yeah.

2:17
And that's it. Who else?

2:20
Who else are you bringing? Andrew.

2:25
Andrew. I've been trying to talk to him. I haven't had a conversation with =
him. I'm pretty sure he's interested. I've talked about it before. Fairly =
new. Anish is definitely coming. I don't know if you know Anish.

2:40
Anish, yes.

2:43
Yeah, he's definitely coming. Let's say there's a couple =
others. Like, Jamie's gonna come, actually. Jamie Walker. Do you remember =
him?

2:53
Yeah, I was gonna. So that was on my list of questions I was =
gonna ask because I thought that he was going. You know what I'm talking =
about? Yeah, I was. I was gonna ask about Jamie, if he was gonna go. I mean=
, I. I like. I really like Kieran, and I was very happy that Kieran went.

3:25
Yeah.

3:26
And so it makes me happy that you're going because it's a =
move that I've thought about, like, I think, like, putting all of our cards=
 on the table. I've had an open line back to kpmg, where I came from, with =
Lane for a while.

3:49
Yeah. Oh, my God. Do you think I love Lane? Do you =
think he will come?

3:55
Yeah, Lane is great. I Mean, Lane's. The reason =
that I'm at UIP is because Lane went. And then I saw that he went. And we =
were in the same group at kpmg. We came up under the same people at kpmg. =
So we came up under the. Under the same DD people. They were all Lane. And =
the rest of our crew was from West Monroe. And we came up doing diligences =
to together. And so Wayne and I have been talking this week about going and=
 working on PMO for Honeywell or something. I think under you. I know, I =
know.

4:31
Yeah.

4:32
Yeah.

4:32
And I was just talking to him about it.

4:34
Yeah. Lane would go. I think, like, if you made the case for him. =
Lane would go. Because he's. Wayne is so good. Technically, he's so good.

4:45
Oh, my God, he's.

4:46
Yeah.

4:46
I'm like, so impressed with them.

4:48
So there were so many KPMG people like that that I came up with.

4:52
Are you serious? Oh, my gosh. I will take all of them.

4:56
Yeah. And that's why I liked Lane because he had the, like, the technical =
backing to. To go with it. And they were all like, West Monroe people. It =
was Lane. There's a guy in the Denver office named Rami, but anyone you can=
 find from West Monroe has that, like, technical background. But I mean, =
I'm sort of going on a tangent. I think I would go for sure.

5:26
Okay.

5:27
Because eyes great and I am. I mean, it wouldn't be the same without =
you. Like, you're one of the big reasons that I've stuck around here. Like,=
 because I have. I've loved what we do. And I think working on a Willcoy =
project is sort of an acquired taste. And once you get a taste for it, you =
either love it or you hate it. And I really loved it.

5:58
Oh, thanks.

6:01
And like, you're one of the big reasons, I think, that I stuck around.=
 And it would be really sad to me to be here if you weren't around, because=
 it's like you're one of the people that, like, kept me, like, going.

6:19
Yeah. I appreciate it.

6:21
Yeah. And so if. If you went to PwC.

6:28
Yeah.

6:29
I mean, it's like, if there was the ability to have a =
conversation with the BWC folks and be like, they will reach out.

6:37
Yeah. Kieran will call you.

6:39
Perfect.

6:40
Yeah. So the question =
right now is, like, more timing. Like, they're willing to, like, bring =
folks in. It's going to take me probably a little while to get there. Yeah,=
 I think so. I would say, like, so funny. I would say just talk to them if =
you can.

7:01
Yeah.

7:01
Okay. And the trip. Go from there. Okay.

7:04
Do you think it's worth going before or after August?

7:08
Why?

7:10
Bonus.

7:12
Definitely after you get your bonus. Right? I mean, like, =
whatever the bonus date is. I would say resign right after the bonus date.

7:18
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. That was my only question and is like.

7:25
Yeah, yeah.

7:25
Before. After that day.

7:30
No, that. That makes =
perfect sense.

7:32
Yeah. You should talk to Andrew. I would love.

7:37
I am talking to him. Yeah.

7:39
I talk to Kelly.

7:41
Really?

7:43
Kelly.

7:43
Okay. I love Kelly. I love Kelly.

7:45
Kelly is so good.

7:46
I would love to get Kelly. I would love.

7:48
Tell Kelly. Tell Kelly you can make the. For her. I was in an Uber with her=
 for two hours on Thursday, and she told me the same thing that I had =
experienced always. And that it's not a cultural fit, but she will make a =
really good consultant. And she was asking me what should I do with my life=
. And my appeal to her was, Kelly, you are so good at this. Like, don't. =
Don't throw it away because you've had, like, one bad manager or one bad =
project or one bad culture. Like, you're Anthony, really.

8:30
Okay.

8:30
She said that she leaves her with fear and anxiety. Okay. And so if you =
appeal to the Will give you stability. We'll give you.

8:42
Yeah.

8:43
Normal life. And you can, like. She wants a life outside of consulting, =
which is understandable for someone who is not good at making that for =
themselves. And if you appeal to that side, you could get Kelly because =
she's so good.

9:00
I know.

9:01
She's so smart. She's killer.

9:05
Yeah. Okay.

9:06
She's perfect. She's so good. Talk to her.

9:11
So talk to Andrew. Yeah, that's. Andrew's on my list to talk to him tonight=
, but I can't get him tonight. I think he's out partying in New York.

9:21
Is he back in New York?

9:23
He's in New York this week for some reason. =
That's all I know. Because he was trying to, like, come. Come out and come =
out of dinner. I was like, I'm just like, I'm trying to figure this out.

9:35
Yeah.

9:36
So there's some.

9:37
When did you find out?

9:38
What's that?

9:39
When did you find out?

9:42
There's some interesting =
situations happening right now. So I'll just say that, like, you know. You =
know, I'm gonna step aside. I would say don't tell PWC this either.

9:57
What should I do for the next three weeks?

10:02
I wouldn't. I would say =
just chill and don't worry about it because there's a guy.

10:08
That wants me to do commercial due diligence. With ssg.

10:15
Okay. My recommendation is, I think I will put you on top of the list, and =
Kieran will talk to you really soon. Take a week of vacation and figure =
this out.

10:27
Yeah.

10:29
They're literally trying to, like, you know, =
they're basically pushing. I was trying to, like, delay until I finish all =
my, like, discussions and stuff. They're basically like, look, like, you =
know, like, there's a timing factor I think they're struggling with. Like, =
look, we have time. We have ability to bring a team in. They're still =
working through my stuff. And so I was like, makes me.

11:00
This makes me so happy in the process.

11:02
Okay. I'm. I'm glad. I feel =
better as well, because I felt really like that was my toughest part about =
leaving, like, seeing this parent leave. I was like, yeah, I just feel like=
 there's other people. Right. It's like, be. It's tough to. To leave all =
the good people.

11:19
I saw Kieran leave, and it made me start thinking =
about it.

11:22
I know. Yeah. I actually started these conversations =
before Karen left. So I was. And yeah, when he left, I was like, kind of =
like, wink. I actually told him to talk to the head of the practice in PwC.=
 Right. Because he was asking me, what should he do, you know, because he =
wasn't going to make that lead this year.

11:41
Yeah.

11:42
And then I was like, look, you know, we know the same people. I was like, =
why don't you just call. Call Ron, call jj, have a conversation. I'm pretty=
 sure they'll bring you in. Right. That's what he did. And then when he =
left us, like, I didn't tell him. I was like, it's a small world. Maybe =
I'll see you around.

11:58
Kieran is so good, too. Like, I was so happy. I=
 was so happy when I saw that.

12:06
Yeah. So I will talk to. I mean, like=
, you know, if you can, like, it's. You know, I would say, look, I just =
started working with Blake. Like, I think he's, like, the best in the world=
. Right. Do you think. Do you think you'd be interested? Like, I can get =
into the. I know he's in the path to the next level. I can get him to the =
next level for sure. You think he's. You think he'd be interested?

12:30
Definitely.

12:30
I just don't know him.

12:31
That's why he's obviously.

12:33
Okay. Okay.

12:35
That's why you. And he loves you, because I was =
talking to him about you because he said, I've only worked on a Will =
project for, like, a week or two. And I was, I was grilling him about you. =
I was like, what do you think? Like, how's your, like, how's your Will, =
whatever? And he spoke so highly of you. He was like, will and I, we really=
 balance each other out because I'm so logical and so like planned, =
methodical thinking. And Will kind of goes in and he questions, have you =
thought about this? Have you thought about that? Have you thought about the=
 other thing? And I'm like, yeah, that's, that's what he does. And he spoke=
 so highly of you. And it made me really confident going to work for him =
and then you. So I haven't talked to him extensively about where he's at, =
like culturally, but I know that he has the same lines back to KTMG that I =
do and I know that it's been open in the same way that mine has. And so I'm=
 sure that with the right conversation, getting someone technical like that=
, like he knows modeling and costing and TSAs and everything pre day one. =
Like if you want someone who can do DD or do anything technical, that's =
your guy for sure. Or PMO or any of the bullshit, like nitty gritty day to =
day operations of things. Oh, the person that you call.

14:09
Yep.

14:09
Like pre day one planning. Yeah, exactly.

14:14
I think he's awesome. I'm =
looking forward to getting him.

14:17
Yeah.

14:18
And then I'll, I'll talk, I'll talk to Kelly if you know, I will not say =
anything about what you told me. I'll just. And see if she's interested.

14:26
Yeah. Just be like, hey, how, how's it going? Well, I mean, she has =
like an existential conversation with me the other day out of nowhere about=
 what should I do.
