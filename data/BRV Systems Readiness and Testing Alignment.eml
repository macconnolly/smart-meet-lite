Meeting Summary: IT & Functional Teams Alignment Session

*Date:* June 12, 2025
*Location:* Virtual / Hybrid (noted: Jeff, Sandra, Arpit, Srinivas, others)
*Purpose:* To review status and planning for systems and process readiness,
alignment, and testing related to BRV (Business Reorganization/Value
initiative) and upcoming 8/1 changes=E2=80=94especially HR/HCM, payroll, an=
d
supporting IT systems.
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Alignment Sessions and Background

   - *Kickoff Timeline:*
      - *Initial Kickoffs:* April and first week of May
      - *Broader Process Kickoff & UAT Sessions:* Mid-May
   - *Ongoing Work:* Since mid-May, focus has been on:
      - Assessing readiness of functions and systems for 8/1 changes.
      - Validating what systems are impacted and process changes required.
      - Confirming test dates, windows, entry/exit criteria, and workflow
      responsibilities.
      - Tracking test tools and ownership of test script/scenario
      definitions.
      - Planning logistics for business user testing (especially in
      HR/HCM), recognizing that HCM testing is less intensive than ERP/Fina=
nce
      scopes.

2. Scope of Impacted Systems

   - *Primary Systems Identified:*
      - *PeopleSoft*
      - *Honeywell HCM*
      - *ADP Payroll*
      - *SAP (data dependency)*
   - *Clarifications:*
      - HCM references corrected (no SCM mislabel).
      - Finance involvement needed for creating cost centers (tracking
      handled internally, owner in Finance: Michael Carvalho).
      - Coordination between Finance-created cost centers with HR/HCM
      mapping.

3. Current Status & Testing Plan

   - *Test Data & Setup:*
      - Each employee file (PFEP) will be mapped to future state cost
      centers (effective 8/1), loaded to Honeywell HCM QA, then sent
downstream.
      - All foundational data (cost centers) must be present in QA before
      loads.
      - Cost center setup requests (except for Saudi and UAE due to
      incorporation/bank account delays).
   - *Testing Activities Breakdown:*
      - *HCM (HR) Testing:* Load and validate employee transfer file in QA.
      Final master load for production shortly before 8/1.
      - *PeopleSoft:* Setup of new legal entities; no lower environment
      testing indicated.
      - *Payroll System (ADP & Celergo):* Payroll configuration for new
      legal entities, especially US, is complete in QA and tested.
      - *Manual Interface:* For non-automated ADP payroll feeds, countries
      will use a manual process (test plan included by ADP PMs).
      - *Testing Periods:*
         - *HCM QA Testing:* Planned for July, dependent on completion of
         data and mapping.
         - *Payroll Parallel Testing:* US to use June data for testing in
         July (not =E2=80=9Ctrue=E2=80=9D parallel for all geographies).
      - *Downstream/Bridge Testing:* No downstream impact expected per HR
      analysis=E2=80=94no structural reorg, only data changes.
      - *UAT Responsibilities:* IT supports technical loading and error
      correction; business (HR) and ADP vendors handle user acceptance and
      sign-off for respective areas.
   - *Testing Entry & Exit Criteria:* Not all typical ITSIT/UAT processes
   are relevant, as this is not a code/systems change but a data
   migration/activity.

4. Status of Country-Specific Activities

   - *Cost Center Setup:*
      - All countries submitted except Saudi and UAE (due to delays);
      Ireland set up but delayed for business reasons.
      - Ongoing coordination with Michael Carvalho (Finance).
   - *Payroll:*
      - US payroll config complete and tested; changes in QA ready for
      production migration.
      - For rest of world, manual feeds to ADP (testing under global/local
      ADP PMs).

5. Readiness Tracking and Reporting

   - *Upcoming Readout:*
      - *June 25, 2025 (6/25):* Full-day BRV workshop in Charlotte to
      provide a holistic readiness view; Jeff leading.
      - Alignment needed for presentation, standardized template across
      work streams.
      - Action to ensure non-ERP/HR testing/changes are appropriately
      represented.
   - *Team Coordination:*
      - Coordination with Rakesh, Arpit, and others to validate testing and
      readiness dates.
      - Communication of upcoming activities, status, and inclusion of all
      relevant stakeholders (e.g., Matt, Kelly, Sarah).
   - *Follow-up / Future Focus:*
      - 10/27 initiative is a separate topic to be handled after BRV is
      complete, with appropriate CAPG involvement.

Rakesh0:00
What we're trying to do is get alignment sessions going between the IT
teams and the functional teams. We had the kickoffs back in April. Well,
first week of May. We had the broader process kickoff and UAT sessions in
the middle of May. Since then, we've been working with each of the
functions to understand how ready they are, what do they need from it, how,
how ready are the systems? Where are we with, you know, having. Confirming
all the test dates in windows? Do we have entry and exit criterias? Hey,
Sandra, thanks for making it.
Sandra0:37
Hello.
Rakesh0:37
Welcome back.
Sandra0:39
Thank you.
Rakesh0:40
All right, so let me take a step back. So again, alignment calls between IT
and the functions. We kicked off in May. We had the middle of May
conversation around the process workshop. Since then we've been working
with each of the functions to say for all the systems impacted and all the
processes changing for 8.1, how ready are we? What does it need to do?
Where are we in terms of validating all of the systems and having owners
around it? Confirming all of the testing windows, the dates, the testing
tools if needed. Have we sorted out the entry exit criteria for these ruled
roles and responsibilities? And we'll have to see in the HR space, HCM
space, how applicable that is because I think they're all well defined. But
you know, what tools are we using, who's going to define any test scripts,
who's going to define the scenarios if needed, etc. How are we running the
tests, how are we managing defects, if any, you know, logistics and next
steps around, you know, what sort of testing will be needed, what sort of
business user testing are we signing up for, etc. Now, in the HCM space, it
may not be as intensive and as I guess intensive is in Word, as the case
may be in ERP or Finance scope, but this call was more of a working session
for this team to talk through some of these things and identify if there's
anything still pending for the systems, for the windows, for the owners,
etc. So let me pause there before we step into more details and work
through the sausage making here. See if. Jeff, Sandra, you had any comments
or thoughts or anything else you would like to discuss as part of this
conversation?
Jeff2:33
You know, I don't think I have anything else right now. Let's. I think we
just, let's go ahead and get into it and I'll probably have questions along
the way.
Sandra2:42
Okay, yeah. And just FYI, I am in Charlotte for a full week of HR workshops
and comp workshops.
Rakesh2:50
Okay.
Sandra2:50
I stepped out for this call, so if I don't have heavy lifting for the next
hour. I'll maybe stay for another five or 10 and then I'll contact with our
pit or Jeff, anything HCM specific, if that's okay.
Rakesh3:03
So perfect. So that's fine then if you want to go back to that folder here.
So it may not be that intensive as well. So I know we have Srinivas as
well. So from a systems perspective, I think what we're saying is, you
know, and Arpit, keep me honest here as well that you know, PeopleSoft will
be touched. Honeywell HCM would be touched. ADP payroll would be touched.
We have information or data we need from SAP. Are there other areas that
are going to be impacted by BRV that we need to start tracking and
understanding? You know, where readiness.
Sandra3:42
Is that Honeywell HCM or is SCM just a misspelling?
Rakesh3:46
No, no H. Hcm. Yeah, the second one is hcm. Yeah, it should be misspelled
no problem.
Sandra3:52
I just wanted to confirm. Yeah, I wasn't aware of. No H. Yeah, hcm. There
you go.
Rakesh3:57
And then it's Honeywell ADP payroll. You might have. Your keyboard might
have been off.
Sandra4:05
Now if we have to touch. We don't. But Finance has to create cost centers
for us. Are they tracking their own list of things they need to do?
Rakesh4:18
They are and we need validation and confirmation of that. I know Finance
had it in their list as one of the items Srinivas. Would you be able to
answer that? Would you know.
Srinivas4:33
Yeah, I think there is a person named called Michael. He's submitting all
of those requests.
Sandra4:37
Right, right.
Srinivas4:39
Once we have that list, I think we can share.
Arpit4:43
So from, yeah, from the system's perspective, I think EHM will be covered
by Finance. We just have to make sure.
Sandra4:49
That's fine.
Arpit4:50
It is in their inventory.
Sandra4:51
That's fine.
Arpit4:52
Yeah. And that's the starting point for the changes which will flow to HCM
and other systems.
Sandra4:58
Okay, great.
Rakesh5:00
Now from a testing perspective, Sandra, maybe, and maybe Arpit, you can
provide some info on this. Like where are we? Is there any SIT testing
periods or scenarios that are being run to make sure all of this is
working, whether it's a tabletop exercise or if there's actually true SIT
going on at this time for this?
Sandra5:25
No, not that I'm aware of, but ARPIC can answer after me. What I know we
have to do is load the employee file with the new cost centers aligned to
the new legal entities. Right. And all that foundation data needs to be set
up in QA of hcm.
Rakesh5:54
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Let's go. I apologize. Copilot messed up. Do you mind
repeating that, Sandra? You may. It might have put you in mute as well.
Sandra6:15
Hello?
Rakesh6:16
Yeah, sorry.
Sandra6:17
Okay. Okay. No, no, no. No worries. I didn't realize I was muted. So. Okay.
So the plan for every person file pfep, it lists each employee with the
future state call center with the effective date of 8:1. Right. And that is
our employee transfer file we have to load into QA of hcm. Honeywell hcm.
Right. It loads into the test environment. So all the foundation data needs
to be set up in QA with the call centers that Trini just commented. Michael
Carvalho. Right. Is currently submitting in EHM to get set up for us. Those
need to be created in QA as well. And the PFEP file will be loaded there
and sent to downstream systems recipients of employees and their cost
centers. So it goes to all downstream for them to test. That's just the
employee transfer piece of it. I'm not aware of any SIT or any other lower
environment that needs to be tested.
Rakesh7:26
Okay.
Arpit7:28
Yeah.
Sandra7:28
Now from a PeopleSoft perspective, I think the only thing is that the
illegal entities, the PeopleSoft companies. Companies need to be set up
with the new legal entities and they obviously there's a whole bridge
process between PeopleSoft and HCM, but I don't believe there's any lower
environment testing from a PeopleSoft perspective.
Rakesh7:49
Got it.
Arpit7:50
That is correct. So in short, there are two pieces where we will have
testing. Not really following the typical ITSIT UAT over there, but there
is going to be a testing. First the employee load, which Sandra just said.
Like we're going to load everything in QA and validate everything and then
same activity happens in prod when the time comes.
Rakesh8:11
When is the QA testing? Do you know? Is should be like July.
Sandra8:17
It should be the month of July, but we are still waiting on the data to be
completed.
Rakesh8:23
Okay.
Sandra8:24
The call center set up. Right. The employees need to be mapped to the cost
center. There's a whole pfep, the line by line mapping once the cost
centers are completed.
Rakesh8:35
And that we would get from Michael Carvalho as to the when that might be
complete.
Sandra8:39
Michael is creating the cost centers required in country by function. Then
HR owns mapping line by line. Right. People to cost center.
Jeff8:51
Yeah.
Rakesh8:52
Okay. And Arpit, maybe Mac and I will work with you on dates for those I
think because part of the thing that Jeff is starting, the other Jeff is
wanting to know is understanding all the test dates and readiness dates and
he wants us to Start tracking that for UAT right now. Certainly coming into
the 625 workshop, he wants a view of, you know, where we are across these.
So if we have dates for these and I think we have them in the track one, I
assume. In the track one I was going.
Srinivas9:25
Rakesh, I think for Michael's recent update to me, he did complete
submitting the requests, I believe so I think it.
Sandra9:34
Was for every country except for Saudi and UAE because we don't have
PeopleSoft company set up because of the incorporated delay and the bank
accounts and everything else. So I believe those two countries were being
replanned anyway.
Rakesh9:51
Okay.
Srinivas9:52
Including Ireland as well.
Sandra9:53
Right, right, right, right. We don't have an issue with Ireland. I think
Ireland's set up already. But I believe there was business reasons that was
getting delayed.
Rakesh10:04
Okay.
Arpit10:05
Yeah.
Rakesh10:05
All right, so we'll track that. Yeah.
Arpit10:07
In the track one, if you remember the evening, track one, track two calls,
I have an activity list. I will just run it by you again. It's a older
version, so probably the dates might have changed. But I see like for now I
have like initial HCM load for validation planned for 7, 1. I will
revalidate all the dates with you.
Sandra10:28
That was the plan. But we have to get realistic now and see where the data
is. So.
Arpit10:32
Yes, so that's on the employee like coset is getting created in EHM system,
employees getting mapped and that mapping file or whatever that table needs
to be updated or initial load. The employee master load in hcm. This is one
set of activity, Rakesh. The second set of activity is kind of activating
payroll for those new legal entities. That is on Prabhakar, the HR IT team
to configure those legal entities for activating the payroll. That has been
done for the us. For the US Yeah, that has been done and tested. They are.
And the changes are in qa. So whenever the Q like all other elements are
ready, the QA can be done and IT can move to production.
Rakesh11:28
And production would be eight, one.
Sandra11:31
Yes, yes.
Rakesh11:35
Okay.
Arpit11:36
I just have one last question for Sandra on testing. Sandra, like the
Celero or the rest of the world, payroll will have its own entire testing
and payroll parallel. There is going to be a, you know, there's a manual
feed we need to provide to adp. Like extract some employee information from
hcm, send that file to adp. Are we planning to test that manual process as
well? Like who's going to do it? Is it email or we place it in some folder.
Sandra12:09
It's part of the ADP Test plan. So that is the part of the process because
the Celergo connector. I don't know if you were on. There was a tech or IT
call yesterday with them.
Arpit12:22
Yeah, I was there.
Sandra12:23
Yeah. That planning is happening for 11:1 but the manual process to get it
to ADP is part of what each country's.
Arpit12:31
Right, Perfect.
Rakesh12:33
Yeah.
Arpit12:33
So that's part of. Got it. So if I pick up payrolls plan from William
Douglas, it will cover the manual testing as well.
Sandra12:43
I don't know if William Douglas has it. I think the ADP Will Harper. Right.
Is the global PM and then they have a PM for each country.
Arpit12:54
Okay.
Rakesh12:55
Okay.
Arpit12:55
So like if I have to pull up like overall dates for testing and provide it
to Rakesh and Mac. Sandra, will William have it or I'll have to reach out
to adp.
Sandra13:06
You can ask Will Douglas. He will probably know right. Where to go get it.
But just so you know, I don't know if he's managing the global plan. That's
an ADP plan.
Arpit13:16
Yeah.
Sandra13:16
I mean the plan is for July to be doing what they call parallel testing.
Even though it's not truly parallel. Us will be doing parallel testing in
Lyric. Right. From say like June data. They'll use June data for July
parallel. Okay. But I think Celergo is a slightly different process they
follow.
Rakesh13:38
Got it.
Sandra13:38
Yeah.
Arpit13:39
So I'll connect with William Douglas and share that information with Rakesh=
.
Rakesh13:44
Yep.
Arpit13:45
That's the payroll piece.
Sandra13:46
Yes.
Jeff13:48
Hey Arpit on. On that employee master load from a testing perspective.
Beyond testing the data updates in Honeywell hcm, are we anticipating a
testing plan to look at as well that PeopleSoft Bridge and some sample
testing I guess of downstream interfaces as well. Like what's. What's the
full scope of that test or is that up for discussion?
Sandra14:21
I would need the HR to speak to that.
Arpit14:26
Yeah, I will have to check but I don't think I've not heard that from
Rajni's team that there's going to be a downstream impact testing. They did
a downstream impact analysis and came back saying like there is no
downstream impact from the changes which HR is suggesting.
Sandra14:47
It's not a reorg. Right? Exactly. It's not a reorg. So there's no
structural as I would say. Right. Complex maybe as a rework would have been=
.
Jeff14:56
Got it. And then just my other question too. As we talk about like the
concept of uat, are you looking or are we looking to HR it to do user
acceptance testing or are there solstice. Is there a user base there that
we're planning to like double coordinate the testing. Like, is that an HR
function, an HR systems or an HR IT function as we consider uat.
Sandra15:21
I think it's it, which is why Rajani was concerned up front. Right. Because
of resources. She wanted to make sure. Right. They understood what the
change was because it requires IT support, because they have to load in the
QA and then it has to be pushed to downstreams.
Jeff15:37
And who does the testing and sign off there? Like does Raj and his team
sign off on the UAT or is that a business function?
Sandra15:43
That's probably, that's more than likely business.
Arpit15:47
So Jeff, right now the payroll piece of configuration, which I said is
already done in PeopleSoftware US, that is like an IT system change which
Rajni's team is involved in. Employee transfer is a business transaction.
So business will conduct that transaction and validate and sign off. No, it
like it will be involved if there is something which is not not working
correctly and to fix that. But it will not be coordinating or signing off
on that activity. The third piece is ADP for rest of the world. It is
following the entire implementation plan. So ADP vendor as IT is involved
along with HR business, Kellero, Zen's team.
Jeff16:31
Okay, got it. All right, that, that makes sense.
Rakesh16:35
Yeah, thanks for that clarification.
Sandra16:37
So, so, and just so you guys are aware, if it comes up, if it's questioned,
but the test file that will be sent is just that it's a point in time. We
know they're still onboarding people or trying to bring on additional
resources in those incremental hire roles. So there will have to be a final
file sent right at the end of July just prior to 8:1 to make sure we've
included all the right additional resources. We can't, we can't leave a man
behind, so to speak.
Jeff17:10
So the testing will be sometime in, I guess, early July presumably. Then
there'll be a final file that.
Sandra17:16
Will be like, yes, just before 8. 1. Because people could have moved, we
could have ads, you know, I don't know terms. Who knows.
Arpit17:31
Anything else?
Rakesh17:32
Yeah, no, I think, I think, I think this is a good spot. So now certainly
we spoke about, you know, some of the sign ops. And so again, I think, you
know, what I'm understanding is the testing is again, it's handled by
different teams here. We may need to understand with Rajni and her team,
you know, how those sign offs are happening and how they're reporting on
it. Certainly if anything that's in the ADP purview, if they're going to
handle it fully. We may just need an update. We will need an update from
them on how that is coming along and we'll just report out on it. I think
outside that and what we're.
Sandra18:11
Doing with with Rajini and team right with hrit this is. It's pretty
standard. I know they've not done it very often in HCM but the process of
transfers and you know mass load transfers, things like that happen. So
there is a you know, standard test plan process for approvals etc. So it
shouldn't be.
Rakesh18:31
It's not any reinventing.
Sandra18:33
It is not.
Jeff18:34
There's no code or systematic change. It's a data change, right? Pretty
much data change, yeah. And the exception being just it sounds like the
payroll piece of this. Right. Ensuring we've got payroll configuration for
us system and we're validating that and then the ADP piece of course seems
like maybe the larger right piece to this.
Rakesh18:56
Yep, got it. So and again this is all for 81 now certainly for 1027 there's
a whole slew of different and we that I think arit we should get from Cap G
in terms of all of that activity. Correct.
Arpit19:12
Yeah. My ace is suggestion is Rakesh if we start like we talk about that as
a separate topic because a lot of times we confuse the audience with two
systems. So we focus and get everything you need for BRV and the moment we
have everything for BRV I'll make sure we have the right people from CAPG
to talk about 1027 as well.
Rakesh19:32
Okay. Understood.
Arpit19:34
Yeah.
Rakesh19:34
So I think as a whole, I think from a systems perspective we have a V so we
we have action item to work with you Arpit to get that view from a from a
testing readiness perspective we'll also work with you to understand that I
don't know if we need anything else from a systems perspective Srinivas
Anything on the ERP side that we need to talk about here?
Srinivas20:00
The only one actually I think I'll have to go and check with Satish team
from EHM to SAP and the setup that what we have already in place IFI coe to
see if they have they were able to get all of those cost centers that were
submitted in EHM are configured approach for testing in SIT before giving
it to users. So let me do that.
Sandra20:27
Yeah.
Rakesh20:29
Okay. I and Srinivas I know Mac and I were connecting with you separately
on another ask so we can if we end this call early we'll try to connect
with you on that.
Srinivas20:39
Sorry for the Interruption. I think we need Bill there some majority of the
scope is Bill Faria. I want him to be on the call to us.
Rakesh20:52
Okay, we'll try to get a set up call but outside that I, I think we have
good information here. Again, as we said, it's not the typical ITSIT uat.
So some of the activities around entry exit criteria are probably not
relevant here. Some of the testing and logistics is probably not relevant
here as well. I think the rest of it is in terms of just tracking. So we
have action items. It's just tracking to readiness and, and then I think
some of this information will start reporting on and use for the 625 BRV
readout that Jeff is planning in Charlotte. So I think the invites would go
out for that, that's the full day workshop, etc. But I think more to come
on that from the pmo.
Sandra21:41
So Rakesh, can you guys include me on whatever your presentations look like
for this piece so. So I can be aware?
Rakesh21:48
Yes, absolutely. And I think it's a canned set of slides that different
work streams would do. There's a standard template they've done and there's
probably a line item for non ERP systems or HR here for it.
Sandra22:02
Because Matt and Kelly and Sarah will be in the room. So I want to make
sure they're aware also going in.
Rakesh22:08
Understood. Yes, we'll share that information ahead of I think by next week=
.
Sandra22:12
So thank you.
Rakesh22:13
Okay. I think we're in a good spot. So I don't have much more on this and
we'll give you back half an hour but no thanks Sandra for jumping in on
this.
Sandra22:25
No problem.
Rakesh22:27
Other things, Jeff or Srinivas, any other questions or clarifications you
needed?
Srinivas22:33
I think I'm good for now, Rakesh, thanks.
Rakesh22:35
Okay, so we'll send out the notes and action items again. Certainly. So.
Jeff22:39
Sounds good.
Rakesh22:41
All right, thank you all. Thank you.
Sandra22:43
Thank you everyone.

ack. So again, alignment calls between IT and the functions. We kicked off =
in May. We had the middle of May conversation around the process workshop. =
Since then we&#39;ve been working with each of the functions to say for all=
 the systems impacted and all the processes changing for 8.1, how ready are=
 we? What does it need to do? Where are we in terms of validating all of th=
e systems and having owners around it? Confirming all of the testing window=
s, the dates, the testing tools if needed. Have we sorted out the entry exi=
t criteria for these ruled roles and responsibilities? And we&#39;ll have t=
o see in the HR space, HCM space, how applicable that is because I think th=
ey&#39;re all well defined. But you know, what tools are we using, who&#39;=
s going to define any test scripts, who&#39;s going to define the scenarios=
 if needed, etc. How are we running the tests, how are we managing defects,=
 if any, you know, logistics and next steps around, you know, what sort of =
testing will be needed, what sort of business user testing are we signing u=
p for, etc. Now, in the HCM space, it may not be as intensive and as I gues=
s intensive is in Word, as the case may be in ERP or Finance scope, but thi=
s call was more of a working session for this team to talk through some of =
these things and identify if there&#39;s anything still pending for the sys=
tems, for the windows, for the owners, etc. So let me pause there before we=
 step into more details and work through the sausage making here. See if. J=
eff, Sandra, you had any comments or thoughts or anything else you would li=
ke to discuss as part of this conversation?</div></div><div style=3D"margin=
