Main Topics Discussed

   1.

   Site-Level Application Impact and Soft Spin Concerns
   - Questions were raised by site leads and IT/ISE operations directors
      regarding the effect of organizational changes, particularly "soft sp=
in,"
      on applications at the manufacturing site level.
      - The need for clarity was highlighted, especially with ongoing ERP
      changes and legal entity reorganizations.
      - The session aimed to align the team, update stakeholders, and
      identify what (if anything) needs user acceptance testing (UAT).
   2.

   ERP and Legal Entity Changes
   - ERP changes involve nine companies being renamed and reusing plants
      and addresses; relevant data (e.g., output forms, labels) will reflec=
t
      updated legal names and addresses.
      - The process and functional operation of ERP are not changing; only
      output information is being updated.
      - Discussion clarified that site-based apps are not currently
      impacted or in scope for label or major process changes.
   3.

   UAT Requirements and Label Testing
   - There is uncertainty and lack of clarity about responsibility and
      scope for UAT, particularly around labels.
      - The team discussed previous expectations that product labels would
      change, but this was updated: labels will remain unchanged due to lac=
k of
      branding, except where output forms (like invoices) must reflect new
      company names.
      - Action: Still a requirement to identify UAT testers for labels,
      despite indications that label changes are not happening immediately.
   4.

   Output Forms and Document Updates
   - Forms and outputs such as Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), Terms and
      Conditions (Ts & Cs), invoices, and possibly quotes will include upda=
ted
      company names.
      - No significant functional or server changes; focus is on
      display/data fields.
   5.

   Third-Party Systems and Additional Labeling Considerations
   - Not all labels come from SAP; for example, in the Spectra business,
      labels for fiber products are generated by the external "Pack
Out" system.
      - Some labels use only the name =E2=80=9CHoneywell=E2=80=9D in generi=
c fonts without
      specific branding.
      - There are regulatory and international shipping label requirements
      that may not be fully addressed yet.
   6.

   Strategic and Legal Considerations for Branding/Labeling
   - Discussion around consistent labeling strategy post-separation: some
      products may display =E2=80=9CHoneywell,=E2=80=9D others =E2=80=9CSol=
stice,=E2=80=9D potentially causing
      inconsistency.
      - Product management and branding teams may need to consult on a
      unified labeling strategy.
      - Direction from the separation management team is that labeling is
      not a "day one" requirement (can be managed post-2026 and after compa=
ny
      separation in November 2027), unless there are regulatory or
legal mandates
      to change labels immediately.

Action Items & Follow-Ups

   - Identify and assign UAT testers for label validation, even if label
   changes are deferred.
   - Clarify requests for label testing by specifying site, software, and
   what exactly needs to be tested.
   - Share the updated guidance regarding what documents need name/address
   changes and which do not.
   - Establish a process to manage post-separation labeling consistency
   with input from product management and branding.
   - Validate regulatory/legal requirements for label changes in
   international markets to ensure compliance.

Key Dates & Figures

   - Today's Date: June 13, 2025
   - Company separation targeted for: November 2027
   - Labeling changes are not required for "day one" post-separation, with
   the transition period extending through at least 2026.
   - ERP updates affect nine renamed companies and their associated
   plants/addresses.

Additional Notes

   - Communication and clarity at the user level (particularly UAT users)
   remain critical.
   - Ongoing collaboration is required across ERP, ISE, site-level,
   branding, and legal teams to ensure smooth transition and compliance.
   - A broader stakeholder education may be warranted as more teams engage
   in UAT and transition activities.

Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)0:00
Those alignment sessions, there were questions and, you know, inquiries
around what is happening to apps at a site level and particularly
manufacturing apps that are getting impacted by soft spin. So I think this
conversation was again, because we needed clarity around it, you know,
particularly with the changes around ERP and the legal entity changes
happening in erp. I should say there's some questions from the site leads
and the IT or ISE ops directors on what is happening to apps at a site
level or manufacturing apps that may get impacted by this. So this call was
primarily to just level set, sync up with the team and help them
understand, you know, what is truly changing and what may need to get
tested, if any, as part of this conversation. Let me pause there. Sriram,
I'll perhaps. And Jerry, maybe if you want to add something or if I, you
know, spoken in error, please do chime in. So, Sriram, Jerry, I'll perhaps
turn it over to you and then we can kick things off.
Jeff Hopkins1:11
I know you covered it well. I mean, I think this is. We're trying to ensure
that everybody's on the same page as far as what manufacturing applications
are affected or not affected and to calm some nerves would be my objective
here in this meeting.
Stephen1:31
Yeah, I'd add it. It might need to be repeated.
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)1:35
Yeah.
Stephen1:36
In my view, by the end of this meeting, let's figure out what users need to
know in order to make educated decisions because the audience, we've got
some folks on this call here, but as we get more folks engaged in UAT and
we gotta figure out exactly who that is, could be a much larger
conversation.
Unknown Speaker 22:02
Yeah, agree.
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)2:08
All right, so now I think we looked at the site level application again. We
can go through, we can skip through this. Right. I think let's go to the
next slide. I think when we looked at the manufacturing applications one,
we want to make sure that we've got the right list of applications that
were the systems that we're talking about in scope. And then as we pull in
the ERP team here as well, we want to understand, you know, what is truly
changing here for these apps as it relates to, you know, any impact.
Stephen2:42
I think we're missing the mark. I think we're out. Basically, this is only
the ISC applications, right?
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)2:50
Correct. Correct.
Stephen2:51
Right.
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)2:52
Okay.
Stephen2:53
So ISC is the user of erp, the user of many of our softwares, and we're
getting asked across the board from other folks who are doing ERP
separation from UAT users. And we're not educating folks on what's changing=
.
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)3:13
I think we got to take this.
Stephen3:15
Up a level, I think is where we got to get to. So this I think is simple.
I'm not worried about what's pointed out here.
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)3:23
Okay, so Srinivas and Bill, perhaps not to put you on the spot, but is
there a bit of an education that you can provide to the team on what is
changing from an ERP perspective?
Srinivas3:44
That's a pretty broad question.
Bill3:47
But in the erp, in the ERP at least these are site based apps, I guess that
we're less concerned about.
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)3:55
So we're not concerned about. So forget the site based apps for now. Yes,
understood. But from a. Yep, sorry, go ahead.
Srinivas4:03
I mean from an ERP perspective, we are for the nine rename and reuse
companies. So we renaming those companies, renaming the associated plants
and updating any addresses because some of the addresses are changing for
those plants and those companies. So the outputs, the forms that come out,
the labels that we produce will have that updated information. From a
process standpoint, nothing should change.
Bill4:33
All right, and so let's take the first piece, the output forms. My
understanding is we're not making any label changes because we don't have
branding information. Product labels.
Srinivas4:46
Right, that's true.
Bill4:47
Is that okay?
Stephen4:48
But I, I have an action still pending. I need a UAT user acceptance testers
denoted for labels action that I have to go get figured out.
Srinivas5:03
Yeah, Stephen, I mean Paul made it clear maybe a week ago, 10 days ago that
you know, product labels because we don't have formal branding and there's
some intellectual property concerns as well for some of products that
they're going to stay as is for soft spend.
Stephen5:19
And why am I being asked to find a UAT person for labels?
Bill5:24
Because they probably weren't. The original plan was to make label changes,
but. Okay, we've decided is that coming from.
Srinivas5:32
ERP or is that coming from hse?
Jaime5:35
It could be two different things, Stephen, like here, like you know, from
an ERP standpoint of you are not making any changes. However, we have these
other tools, small tools, like I think law, where I think I may be
referring the wrong names here. Like in a few other tools that are specific
to site or something like that, if we are moving some of those servers that
it uses, then I think that is where we would have request to test it. Does
it make sense?
Bill6:08
Nothing to do with the labels. So yeah, Jaime, we kind of shift gears.
We're not really discussing really the site based tools here. Right? Yeah,
we kind of, we kind of pivoted to ERP on the ERP right now because the
branding organization doesn't have branding information for us. We're just
not changing product labels or shipping labels from a, you know, Honeywell
to Solstice logo perspective. Output forms, however, things like, I guess
if invoices or terms and conditions will be making a name change for from
Honeywell to Solstice. And we'll use the legal name where it makes sense
like on a signature line. But we'll follow the guide of if we have an
output form that uses Honeywell in one spot but Honeywell International
Inc. In another. Well, we've got the corresponding names on the Solstice
side in a temporary format from the Brandy group. They gave us a black and
white version of it. So that will get changed on output forms. I can't tell
you exactly which ones. Maybe you guys would know better. But I'm guessing
like things like SDSs, if they have it, Ts and Cs, invoices, maybe quotes.
That's where I would see the name change.
Srinivas7:36
RFQs, POS, sales orders, CFCs.
Bill7:43
Yep.
Jaime7:44
Yeah, I was only bringing up to address Steve's comment that some of the
teams are approaching him for UATM labels as an example. Yeah, okay. That
is the case that you know, the reason for them to approach is they may be
doing move as is like you know, some of these other applications right.
Outside of SAP. Steve. So that's the reason why you see, see those requests=
.
Unknown Speaker 38:11
I would, I would just say if that. If that's what it is. I don't know if
that's what it is. They need to be very specific that this site, this
software, we need someone to help do that.
Unknown Speaker 28:21
Right.
Unknown Speaker 38:21
Like I don't know again, when they send a request like that need someone to
help with label testing. That's pretty, it's pretty generic, right?
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)8:30
Sure.
Unknown Speaker 38:31
I think that's part of our challenge. We don't have all the details you
guys have. Yeah. These other systems and we'll get to those in a minute on
the erp. So you're basically saying really the, the outputs of what need to
be tested. Right. All these, these master data elements, for lack of a
better term, are being reflecting on the outputs correctly. But
functionality wise and connectivity wise and server wise, we're not really
changing anything at ERP at this moment. Is that fair?
Srinivas9:01
By and large, that's fair. Yes. The validation of the outputs, we're
automating the test scripts at every step of the way. There's, you know,
different outputs that will come out will need to be validated by each of
the functional areas. Whether that's finance, manufacturing, quality,
procurement, cx, et cetera.
Brian Davis9:25
This is Brian Davis. Can I just jump in for a quick second on labels and
no, we're not really trying to go there, but just for the Spectra business.
All of our fiber that we produce, that label comes from an external system.
So it's not from SAP.
Unknown Speaker 1 (likely meeting facilitator or moderator)9:41
It's.
Brian Davis9:42
It's from the system called Pack Out. So the only thing that's on it is
actually just the word Honeywell. There's no, you know, it's not the
official Honeywell. What do you want to call it? The format?
Bill10:00
Yeah, the font.
Brian Davis10:01
The font and all that. It just says Honeycomb. This says Honeywell on the,
on our, on our box label. So at some point we need to change it and whether
we can do it early or we gotta or whatever, but we just need to know what
that exact naming convention needs to be. So my point is on labels you have
two sides. You have stuff that comes out of SAP, which we do have on some
of our labels and then other labels come out of a separate system.
Unknown Speaker 210:32
So Paul, I want us to consider what's being stated here is 100% correct.
There's also additional labeling requirements based off of international
shipping requirements by country for chemicals. Zilta has to deal with that
quite a bit as well as other locations that have to use standard formats
and fonts. And you're not necessarily looking for a fully branded label. I,
I don't know. Should product management or somebody be managing how we. We
don't want to have something that labeled Solstice and some things labeled
Honeywell and have it mismatched. Is my assumption based on product. Should
that be a larger strategy that's handled like with product management and
branding on how they want to handle that Also I don't know what the
requirements are internationally. If we convey to Solstice, are some of
those labels mandatory to be changed right away? That's more of a legal
question.
Jeff Hopkins11:42
So what we have, the direction we've gotten from the separation management
team is that this is not a day one requirement. That is it's something that
to be managed post 2026, sometime between day one and day two. So right now
our focus is ensuring that we're separating the company and as of November
1027 and labeling can be in, in Honeywell's name or Solstice's name across
documentation is what the direction we've got from Jeff Hopkins unless.
Bill12:24
But to James's point, there was a caveat. Unless there was regulatory or
legal reasons that we have to change it, but I haven't been able to figure
out.
Jeff Hopkins12:35
Yeah.
Bill12:36
Who to go to.

p them understand, you know, what is truly changing and what may need to ge=
t tested, if any, as part of this conversation. Let me pause there. Sriram,=
 I&#39;ll perhaps. And Jerry, maybe if you want to add something or if I, y=
ou know, spoken in error, please do chime in. So, Sriram, Jerry, I&#39;ll p=
erhaps turn it over to you and then we can kick things off.</div></div><div=

 have branding information for us. We&#39;re just not changing product labe=
ls or shipping labels from a, you know, Honeywell to Solstice logo perspect=
ive. Output forms, however, things like, I guess if invoices or terms and c=
onditions will be making a name change for from Honeywell to Solstice. And =
we&#39;ll use the legal name where it makes sense like on a signature line.=
 But we&#39;ll follow the guide of if we have an output form that uses Hone=
ywell in one spot but Honeywell International Inc. In another. Well, we&#39=
;ve got the corresponding names on the Solstice side in a temporary format =
from the Brandy group. They gave us a black and white version of it. So tha=
t will get changed on output forms. I can&#39;t tell you exactly which ones=
. Maybe you guys would know better. But I&#39;m guessing like things like S=
DSs, if they have it, Ts and Cs, invoices, maybe quotes. That&#39;s where I=

 You have stuff that comes out of SAP, which we do have on some of our labe=

, I want us to consider what&#39;s being stated here is 100% correct. There=
&#39;s also additional labeling requirements based off of international shi=
pping requirements by country for chemicals. Zilta has to deal with that qu=
ite a bit as well as other locations that have to use standard formats and =
fonts. And you&#39;re not necessarily looking for a fully branded label. I,=
 I don&#39;t know. Should product management or somebody be managing how we=
. We don&#39;t want to have something that labeled Solstice and some things=
 labeled Honeywell and have it mismatched. Is my assumption based on produc=
t. Should that be a larger strategy that&#39;s handled like with product ma=
nagement and branding on how they want to handle that Also I don&#39;t know=
 what the requirements are internationally. If we convey to Solstice, are s=
ome of those labels mandatory to be changed right away? That&#39;s more of =
a legal question.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;=

 day one and day two. So right now our focus is ensuring that we&#39;re sep=
arating the company and as of November 1027 and labeling can be in, in Hone=
