## 1. Main Topics Discussed

### A. Change Request and Workstream Support

- **Steve Bellat** was assigned to raise a change request for additional =
workstream support.
    - Justin and Steve met last week, documented =
current needs, ran meetings with engineering and ISC teams.
    - Steve intended to write and escalate the change request with Paul but=
 no progress has been communicated; follow-ups have been conducted without =
response.
    - Formal process emphasized as the correct avenue to =
highlight and manage resourcing gaps.
    - Action on tracking and =
surfacing change requests was reiterated for ITLT dashboards.

### B. ITLT Dashboard Requirements and Review

- **Dashboard Elements to =
Include:**
    - **Budget vs Actuals:**=20
        - Emphasis on =
color-coded, clear monthly visuals.
        - Data sources discussed as now=
 available; need to finalize visualization leveraging PBI/reporting =
capabilities.
        - Highlight of those over/under budget ("naughty =
list").
    - **Application Burn Down:**
        - Visualization showing =
which applications are moving into testing, which are behind on design, by =
month.
        - Now entering "six months to Day One" phase: critical =
period; all designs should be finished, everyone to be in execution.
        - Data is available; need to create reveal-focused dashboards.
    - **Change Request Tracker:**=20
        - A robust tracker to be shown=
 at ITLT Forum, with totals of approved change requests (one-time and run =
costs).
        - Direct adjustment to loan/model as changes are tracked.
    - Supporting summaries such as program summaries to be owned by Paul =
and Sukhai.

- **Internal and External Meetings:**
    - Review session =
with "Pierce" on Friday (suggested).
    - **Internal prep session to be =
held Thursday**=E2=80=94confirmed.
    - Collaboration suggested between =
Corey, Justin, Gaurav, and Sakina for dashboard development.

### C. Communications & HR Review Processes

- Updates on the "Ethan's =
hair" item: Conversation with Jeff completed, HR and legal engagements =
scheduled for later today for follow-up actions.
- HR wants to review all =
draft communications to employees before sending (flagged by Jen and =
Andrea).
- Dex now coordinating communication review with program comms/HR;=
 process to ensure HR oversight is confirmed.
- Coordination required =
between communications teams and HR to maintain messaging accuracy and =
compliance.
- Items consolidated for tracking and covered in main topics.

### D. CMDB Disposition Updates

- **Request from Catherine for UI Team =
Access:**
    - UI team currently lacks access to CMDB, expected to receive=
 (potentially read-only).
    - Discussion on risks of losing control over =
flag dispositions if CMDB becomes the system of record (historical =
challenge: lack of updates, clunkiness).
    - Catherine=E2=80=99s =
direction is to migrate to a CMDB "single source of truth," Excel is no =
longer tenable.
    - Read-only access to enable validation and visibility =
for the UI team advocated.
    - One-time load of inventory and disposition=
 into CMDB for Day One separation.
    - Clarity expected on how =
disposition data will be reported and sliced, as CMDB details may vary (ASN=
 vs higher-level reporting).
    - Need for continued close coordination =
between Justin, Catherine, and broader reporting stakeholders.

### E. Budget vs Actual Updates

- Action for Corey and Gaurav to sync and =
align on dashboarding, with Gaurav offering cross-functional support =
(including Sakina and others).
- Note that PMO document updates have been =
completed as of last week.
- Further dashboard refinement and alignment =
ongoing.

### F. LE (Legal Entity) Workshop

- Anish reported material =
preparation for the workshop; draft to be shared with LDS team next week.
- Internal materials review on track.

### G. User Migration Planning

- Meeting to be held today with HR and legal on this topic.
- Peer update: DCN team will define and execute site separation and PC =
migration by site (not by function).
    - Migration schedule not yet =
ready; details expected in about two weeks.
    - Sites and user migrations=
 are accelerated but not necessarily dependent (site wraps expected by =
early October).
    - Approach clarified: migrations by site preferred over=
 by function.

### H. Data Governance Board / Branding

- No material updates since yesterday's meeting.
- Brandi: A "graph deck" =
is being reviewed, with a POV to be established by week=E2=80=99s end; =
pending further feedback from Jen.
- Branding: Paul has sent out guidance =
regarding the official use of "Solstice" and "Solstice AM/Advanced =
Materials"
    - Branding decision: Solstice used everywhere except where =
legal entity names are required.
    - Emails and domain references to be =
updated to solstice.com.
    - ERP/legal documentation requirements to be =
handled at the entity/country level by SRI.
    - Awaiting further =
clarification on terms and conditions for portals.
    - All relevant teams=
 (commercial, ERP, PMO) notified.

### I. Deliverables & TSA (Transition =
Service Agreement) Bottoms-Up Build

- No formal submission for Gate Four =
at this time.
- Continuing to follow up with tower leads for data inputs; =
aiming for an internal review by Friday and bulk of data input into model =
by then.
- OP models are finalized; need to update slide decks to reflect =
any Day One disposition changes (primarily for internal consumption).
- Standalone costs and TSA bottoms-up costs to be further refined as =
allocation numbers are updated.
- Schedules/exhibits for TSA, legal =
language updates, and documentation are upcoming deliverables.
- PMO requires visibility into scheduling and cost models for discussions =
with the deal team.
- **TSA Exit "Spotlight":**
    - Submission by June 23=
 (Friday) targeted.
    - Need preliminary cost and scope view ready.

Transcript:
0:00
You are now connected. You can merge =
your calls when ready. Understanding, you know what was needed for the next=
 phase and what the funding is available. But yes, start with the =
documenting.

0:16
You've been muted to unmute yourself, press star six. =
Who got it?

0:26
Yeah, and I'll say that this, this one was also an action=
 on on what's the name? Steve Bellat was supposed to raise a change request=
. So Justin, I met him last week. We helped him document at least. We ran a=
 number of meetings with the ISC teams and engineering teams that had =
majority of the move as a scope. Based on that, Steve said he'll go and =
write a change request and discuss with Paul that he needs some work stream=
 support that has not come through. I do not know why and I followed up =
with him a couple of times but like that was one way of kind of pressing or=
 you know, raising the issue which is through the formal change request =
process that he needs support of, of some advisory and like hands on board =
people as well. Anyway, let's move to the next one.

1:26
Okay. For itlt once again awaiting invite from peers and communications =
from him. But the deck is underway. And Prashant, we have a review session =
with peers on Friday. Do you suggest we move that out or should I set up an=
 internal review for Thursday?

1:43
No, let's do it and let's look at =
these formats. I think we need to lock down how we want to show burn downs.=
 So I'll just say there are three things that needs two to three things =
that I think definitely need to be on the itlt. Very good dashboarding of =
budget versus actual. So Corey, this is one that we need to really lock =
down. I don't know what's required further. I know we've had some good =
conversations with DJO and Pierce about getting the data. We should utilize=
 our PBI capabilities or reporting capabilities and just come up with a =
month on month like budget versus actuals and who's on the naughty list, =
who's over budget, who's under budget. Like really just color coding this =
out and like no, like with the data sources locked, I think we have =
everything. We just need a good visualization of it. So let's get that in. =
That's super important. Yeah. The other thing that is that we need to start=
 doing now is start showing which apps are going into testing, which apps =
were supposed to complete design but haven't completed design. So like a =
burn down of that by application by month. Right now we're getting into the=
 six months to day one time zone. All the design is Completed. Everyone's =
in execution. And again, Justin, we have all of this data. Right. So it's =
about getting good dashboards and visualizations out there for people to =
see and kind of draw insights. So these are. Yeah, these are the two that I=
 have. Anything else needs to come into it?

3:17
No, we should.

3:19
Oh, sorry. I had a third one change request. So we need to have a very =
strong change request tracker that we show at least highlights in the ITLD =
forum saying this month we have approved change requests totaling X amount =
in one time and the run cost has been an X, Y amount in run cost. And we've=
 got a tracker and that's kind of been adjusted with us and loan model. So =
these are the three main things that definitely need to go in. Along with =
that there's like program summary and other things that. That Paul and =
Sukhai can do.

3:54
Got it. Prashant. And then Corey, if we can connect on=
 the budget versus actual. And then Justin, if you can share the app burn =
down with me and I'll set up our internal review for all of us on Thursday.

4:08
Yeah. And Gaurav, I don't know if Gaurav, you're on call, but =
especially for this dashboarding support, if you can kind of get together =
with Corey, Justin and Sakina. Right. Like, we should have some really good=
 dashboards coming out for these. These trackers. Definitely. So what I'll =
do, I'll also be a part of this call so that we do have a good capability. =
So I'll connect with Sakina and me.

4:41
And Korabul and Corey and we'll =
take it up.

4:44
Awesome. Thank you.

4:46
Exactly. Moving on to why =
Ethan's hair needed early and the call that was supposed to be had with =
Jeff. Rakesh, any updates on how that comment.

4:59
It's tied to the one on the right, so we'll get to it. I think. Yeah, the =
call went okay. We've given him. We have some content to share with him. I =
think some approvals have been coming through. We'll address it. So we'll =
continue the conversation. We'll just need. We have a follow on =
conversation today with a with the HR and legal team and we'll see what the=
 outcomes are.

5:22
So on the same topic, do we have Ashra in the call? I =
think not, but yeah. So Rakesh, Jen and Andrea from HR have pinged us that =
what they're saying is like whenever the draft communications is out, HR =
wants to review it.

5:43
Communications off.

5:46
Like our request is it will wants to send out communications to Wingpence =
Employees, they want to see what's the content of that particular =
communication going in. I checked with Rashid separately on chat. So Rashid=
 is saying now Dex is coordinating with overall program communications team=
 which he feels is reporting to HR or as part of HR to get those =
communications out. So whenever the draft is ready, HR wants to review it =
before it is sent out.

6:26
I have some thoughts on that, but. Okay, let's=
.

6:29
Let's connect. Yeah. And just sort it out. And Sakina, I think we =
can just take off point number five from left and cover it in point number =
one on the right.

6:39
Got it. Will do. For Kathleen's request on the cmdb=
, this disposition updates. The next action is to sync with Kathleen to =
enable access for ui. Rakesh, do you have any conversations planned for =
this?

6:59
Fine. Not yet happening.

7:01
Oh, sorry. What is this? I =
missed it. Yeah, Catherine sent an email basically requesting updates to =
the cmdb but the UI team doesn't have access. So that's kind of what =
attaches. And I don't think we'll get access to like we'll probably just =
get read only access. Right. At the most.

7:18
What's the ask on us to get=
 read only access?

7:22
To do what?

7:24
Be able to view what the =
validation is and what the. What's happening in cmdb.

7:30
Yeah, maybe we can connect more on this. I want to push back a little bit =
on this because while Catherine is driving like this whole move to CNDV =
single source of truth, we will lose complete control of flag dispositions =
if. If we move to CMDB because no one updates CMD property. That's like the=
 whole. It's very clunky.

7:55
We're getting to a point where they're =
going to clone CMDB and take it all as one. So we can't be operating in =
Excel worksheets.

8:01
That's what she's doing.

8:03
She's doing this right. It's the right way to do it as a database and go =
down front end for cmdb. We just need to get plugged in and get re going =
the access to be able to understand that because change right now teams are=
 supposed to make changes in CMDB officially if there's any change requests=
 we'll pass the Excel Master inventory. So we really have to stick to the I=
 Conceptually that's the right thing to do. I think it's us having =
visibility to that and getting access and seeing what we need to do because=
 we can't be maintaining it on Excel sheet.

8:39
I. I don't know how it =
was like in J and J. I don't know same thing but GE and the healthcare =
arrow like this whole moving to CMDB was just because of so many like the =
cmdb. If it's a separate instance that we get at some point that's fine. =
It's not happened yet. We don't know when the CMDB is going to get cloned =
for Athens specifically. Right.

9:03
August, we don't need.

9:06
What are we getting into like so.

9:07
Do you want to see? I have the form=
 which Katherine is asking every service owner to fill in. I can share but =
yeah it's like it's got the spin dispositions as well.

9:19
No, no, you get it but the point is we would. We still need to maintain =
some control visibility and have some control over it so that we can help =
manage some of it. So that's what we're trying to get. So we'll just have =
to engage Catherine and understand what that limitation is.

9:39
Not getting a wrong feeling on this as well. I'll put it out. I. I think =
like getting folks to update dispositions has been a pain already. Like now=
 if we ask them to do the same thing through a form in cmdb.

9:55
No, it's a one time.

9:57
Yeah mentioned nobody's updating things. They've=
 taken our Excel sheet, put it in cmdb. We just have to go and validate =
that spot check.

10:07
I see. Okay, sorry. That's it. And then. Okay so =
what we have is gonna get one time loaded in loaded and.

10:15
It is about day one distinction.

10:17
Nothing else.

10:20
You probably want to do because the whole track of this is you're going to =
clone the CMDB and take it away with them. So as they do new build backs =
and move as is app CIS will change. They'll have to create new app CIS in =
CMDB to maintain those and then when they clone it and take it with them =
they'll have a copy of you know those atoms scope. So we do need visibility=
 into that and understand how that's you know that's being planned so but =
yes, let's, let's talk a little bit more about that so we understand what =
that process is when the timing is etc. But not there's no app disposition =
changes. It's importing the master inventory into it and maintaining it in =
cmd.

11:04
Okay, got it. And Justin, are you tied out with Catherine on =
this?

11:10
This is a conversation we need to have.

11:13
No, I thought Justin was already in touch with her when. When like this was=
 being thought to just not. Hey Justin, are you there? All right, we'll =
come back to this.

11:42
Yeah we need to talk about this because like the =
dispositions are very limited available in cmdb. It's not, it's not =
everything. We have a few for spin but it doesn't die out exactly as =
perspective of dispositions because we are doing leadership.

12:00
Reporting at the 291 level now in CMDB it's going to go at the ASN level =
and we like, I don't know who will filter in what way, how it will be =
sliced and diced. So we need to make sure that just like you know, Justin, =
Katherine and us, like we're on the same page of how this reporting happens=
. That should not change because people lose trust in what we've shown.

12:26
Right.

12:27
Next item.

12:29
Moving on, we're going to talk about =
the budget versus actual again. Corey, if you can get with. If you can set =
up some time with Gaurav to align on like the dashboard. I know you are =
currently analyzing the new latest abstract from Vanilla, but yeah. Any =
other updates?

12:48
No, I think the note on there about updating the PMO =
documents that's been done, that was done last week. So you can. That can =
be more completed. But yeah, we'll sync up with Gorav.

12:58
And.

13:00
Get the dashboard lined up.

13:05
Yep.

13:11
Anish, I know you brought up=
 the LE workshop yesterday and are working on the materials today and then =
you will be reviewing them I guess later with Rakesh and then any other =
updates?

13:26
We're on track for that. We just need to get a draft.

13:28
To the LDS team next week so.

13:30
No, no, she's there right now.

13:33
Got it.

13:39
Sean, I just refer Keshe about this.

13:43
Like 30 seconds ago. All right.

13:49
Sounds good. And then for user =
migration planning and the meeting with Jeff, Rakesh, anything else you =
want to share about that?

13:59
No, I think we spoke about it. We're =
having a meeting with Jeff later on today. I think we're getting more and =
more information. Sorry, not Jeff. We're having a meeting with HR and the =
legal team and what comes of it. We'll be able to share.

14:17
For the BRB planning and UAT kickoff for tomorrow.

14:23
Any problems that still needs a bit of work. So we're looking to meet with =
peers today to align on what we have from the work, you know, the slides =
and have them walk through that and set up a conversation with the =
workstream lead so that they're ready to talk to it tomorrow and walk =
through what we will need to facilitate, etc. So the content is still being=
 developed. We should have it finalized later this afternoon for the =
kickoff deck. Yes. Somebody had a question?

14:58
Yeah, Rakesh, I just =
want to give a brief update on user migrations as well. Just on point =
number one.

15:03
Okay.

15:04
I did speak with the DCN team yesterday to =
align on when they're going to share their site separation and PC migration=
 schedules. We'll likely be defining waves by site, not by function and so =
they've agreed to own the development and execution of both these plans. =
They don't have the details yet to share at this time, but expect it within=
 two weeks. Okay. Just want to give that update.

15:27
Okay. It was always by site, was it not?

15:36
People were throwing around=
 the idea of by function.

15:38
That was your testing. But no, the =
function doesn't make sense.

15:43
Agreed, Agreed. So we're doing it by =
site. I just, there was, there was a few folks within the infrastructure =
team talking about doing it by function, but we're doing it by site so. And=
 we'll accelerate so the site will could possibly be still be on the =
Honeywell network and you have sites and users cut over so those two are =
not dependent on each other. So it'll be accelerated for the users and =
sites will likely be wrapping up early October.

16:12
Okay.

16:16
Sounds good. And then Rakesh, anything on that data governance board and =
Brandi?

16:20
No, nothing. No, nothing from different from yesterday.

16:23
Got it.

16:25
For still action for us to do. We'll still have to. =
And who has a graph deck which we'll review today and we'll take it back to=
 Jen and we'll. We'll get a point of view by end of the week.

16:42
Got it. And for branding, has the email been sent out by Paul?

16:47
Yeah, Paul sent out an email. So what's happened is he's got connected with=
 him earlier this morning, this as well. So we've got the official sources =
name. So that's what he has sent out to be used everywhere. Where we're =
legally bound to use a legal entity name, we will use that perhaps on =
certain labels or certain forms or certain communication but everywhere =
else I think the alignment is that from Solstice leadership is that they'll=
 use Solstice. So emails will have to get changed to first name.=
lastnameolsis.com other, you know, domains, web pages, everything will all =
be sources. Now they own Solstice, Solstice AM and Solstice Advanced =
Materials. So I think where it needs to get changed they will change it to =
Solstice where they've kept it as Solstice AM or other things internally. =
For example they may keep it that and you know, link it back to Solstice.=
com but that's the guidance that Paul has given the team and so that's what=
 the teams are marching towards. So Stephen Brown, the commercial team, ERP=
 team all been notified of that. On the ERP side, you know there are =
certain spots where they have to use the actual legal entity name. So SRI =
and srijab have taken that. SRI particularly is running with that to =
identify what legal entities to be used in what country, etc. So he's got =
that. But for us I think at a high level we understand that the color of =
the font, the logo, all that will come later. But officially they're using =
the Solstice name and so things that need to get changed like I said, like =
email and other websites and others will will get the Solstice.com There =
are a few follow ups that I have with the PMO and branding team on terms =
and conditions to be used in portals and things of that nature. So we're =
waiting for an answer on that following up, but that's where we are with =
the for the branding decision as of now.

19:00
Got it. Thanks Rakesh. =
Anything for the deliverables. I know we are not submitting anything for =
gate four but anything on TSA bottoms up field.

19:11
Yeah Corey, you want to talk about that? We'll get into the exit =
Deliverable.

19:15
Yeah, I think it's the same as we talked about =
yesterday afternoon. We're continuing to follow up with with the tower =
leads to get the data that we need and building the model, updating the =
model with that data. So we're working to by Friday have our internal =
review done and hopefully have all most of that data input into the model. =
So we'll continue to work through that today we have a call right after =
this to align and keep working on that.

19:47
So point on that the OP =
models have been fairly finalized. We should and this is where for our own =
benefit we should create a new model slide deccs with any day one =
disposition changes there have been one or two like value has dropped off. =
So if it's on the tile charts we should update that just to complete that. =
Nothing formal but for us to keep obviously they're all reflected in the =
inventory and in the cmdb. From a standalone cost perspective that goes =
very much in hand with the TSA bottoms up build. So as we get the bottoms =
up build numbers we also remove all of the allocations that are there and =
we pretty much get a receipt of what the parallel run and the standup cost =
would be. So as we get an understanding of what the build back license is =
and build back infrastructure, hosting etcetera so all those allocation =
numbers will go away and reflect truer numbers that the Solstice team has. =
So that's the part that Corey is also working on because standalone run =
will reflect that day. One standalone run will reflect that. Plus the TSA =
costs which are getting updated. So I know based on the conversations at =
TSA exit, we're pressure testing the durations. So we'll get the bottoms of=
 cost numbers. Those will go into the durate, you know, those will be tied =
up with the durations as well. And then the third part on that is the =
scheduling, the document itself. So exhibits and language around the TSA =
schedule, that's something we'll also be working on to refine. PMO is =
looking for a view on that shortly. So even though it's not a deliverable, =
they'll be taking that and discussing it with the deal team. So we do need =
to get that, you know, they want to review that language. So. So that's =
coming up now. The other part on this is the TSA exit spotlight. So what we=
 do need is by the 23rd, we need to submit that. So which means by Friday, =
through everything we spoke, we need a view of the TSA exit scope is and =
potentially a preliminary view into what the costing would be.

what&#x27;s the name? Steve Bellat was supposed to raise a change request. =
So Justin, I met him last week. We helped him document at least. We ran a =
number of meetings with the ISC teams and engineering teams that had =
majority of the move as a scope. Based on that, Steve said he&#x27;ll go =
and write a change request and discuss with Paul that he needs some work =
stream support that has not come through. I do not know why and I followed =
up with him a couple of times but like that was one way of kind of pressing=
 or you know, raising the issue which is through the formal change request =
process that he needs support of, of some advisory and like hands on board =
people as well. Anyway, let&#x27;s move to the next one.</div></div><div =

6">No, let&#x27;s do it and let&#x27;s look at these formats. I think we =
need to lock down how we want to show burn downs. So I&#x27;ll just say =
there are three things that needs two to three things that I think =
definitely need to be on the itlt. Very good dashboarding of budget versus =
actual. So Corey, this is one that we need to really lock down. I =
don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s required further. I know we&#x27;ve had some =
good conversations with DJO and Pierce about getting the data. We should =
utilize our PBI capabilities or reporting capabilities and just come up =
with a month on month like budget versus actuals and who&#x27;s on the =
naughty list, who&#x27;s over budget, who&#x27;s under budget. Like really =
just color coding this out and like no, like with the data sources locked, =
I think we have everything. We just need a good visualization of it. So =
let&#x27;s get that in. That&#x27;s super important. Yeah. The other thing =
that is that we need to start doing now is start showing which apps are =
going into testing, which apps were supposed to complete design but =
haven&#x27;t completed design. So like a burn down of that by application =
by month. Right now we&#x27;re getting into the six months to day one time =
zone. All the design is Completed. Everyone&#x27;s in execution. And again,=
 Justin, we have all of this data. Right. So it&#x27;s about getting good =
dashboards and visualizations out there for people to see and kind of draw =
insights. So these are. Yeah, these are the two that I have. Anything else =
needs to come into it?</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:=

an email. So what&#x27;s happened is he&#x27;s got connected with him =
earlier this morning, this as well. So we&#x27;ve got the official sources =
name. So that&#x27;s what he has sent out to be used everywhere. Where =
we&#x27;re legally bound to use a legal entity name, we will use that =
perhaps on certain labels or certain forms or certain communication but =
everywhere else I think the alignment is that from Solstice leadership is =
that they&#x27;ll use Solstice. So emails will have to get changed to first=
 name.lastnameolsis.com other, you know, domains, web pages, everything =
will all be sources. Now they own Solstice, Solstice AM and Solstice =
Advanced Materials. So I think where it needs to get changed they will =
change it to Solstice where they&#x27;ve kept it as Solstice AM or other =
things internally. For example they may keep it that and you know, link it =
back to Solstice.com but that&#x27;s the guidance that Paul has given the =
team and so that&#x27;s what the teams are marching towards. So Stephen =
Brown, the commercial team, ERP team all been notified of that. On the ERP =
side, you know there are certain spots where they have to use the actual =
legal entity name. So SRI and srijab have taken that. SRI particularly is =
running with that to identify what legal entities to be used in what =
country, etc. So he&#x27;s got that. But for us I think at a high level we =
understand that the color of the font, the logo, all that will come later. =
But officially they&#x27;re using the Solstice name and so things that need=
 to get changed like I said, like email and other websites and others will =
will get the Solstice.com There are a few follow ups that I have with the =
PMO and branding team on terms and conditions to be used in portals and =
things of that nature. So we&#x27;re waiting for an answer on that =
following up, but that&#x27;s where we are with the for the branding =
decision as of now.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16p=

continuing to follow up with with the tower leads to get the data that we =
need and building the model, updating the model with that data. So =
we&#x27;re working to by Friday have our internal review done and hopefully=
 have all most of that data input into the model. So we&#x27;ll continue to=
 work through that today we have a call right after this to align and keep =
working on that.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:0;padding:16px;back=

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">So point on that the=
 OP models have been fairly finalized. We should and this is where for our =
own benefit we should create a new model slide deccs with any day one =
disposition changes there have been one or two like value has dropped off. =
So if it&#x27;s on the tile charts we should update that just to complete =
that. Nothing formal but for us to keep obviously they&#x27;re all =
reflected in the inventory and in the cmdb. From a standalone cost =
perspective that goes very much in hand with the TSA bottoms up build. So =
as we get the bottoms up build numbers we also remove all of the =
allocations that are there and we pretty much get a receipt of what the =
parallel run and the standup cost would be. So as we get an understanding =
of what the build back license is and build back infrastructure, hosting =
etcetera so all those allocation numbers will go away and reflect truer =
numbers that the Solstice team has. So that&#x27;s the part that Corey is =
also working on because standalone run will reflect that day. One =
standalone run will reflect that. Plus the TSA costs which are getting =
updated. So I know based on the conversations at TSA exit, we&#x27;re =
pressure testing the durations. So we&#x27;ll get the bottoms of cost =
numbers. Those will go into the durate, you know, those will be tied up =
with the durations as well. And then the third part on that is the =
scheduling, the document itself. So exhibits and language around the TSA =
schedule, that&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll also be working on to refine. =
PMO is looking for a view on that shortly. So even though it&#x27;s not a =
deliverable, they&#x27;ll be taking that and discussing it with the deal =
team. So we do need to get that, you know, they want to review that =
language. So. So that&#x27;s coming up now. The other part on this is the =
TSA exit spotlight. So what we do need is by the 23rd, we need to submit =
that. So which means by Friday, through everything we spoke, we need a view=
 of the TSA exit scope is and potentially a preliminary view into what the =
costing would be.</div></div></div><div style=3D"margin-top:36px;text-align=
