*
   7. *Operational Alignment and Process/Function Mapping*
   8. *Next Steps and Action Plan*

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *System Ownership Review and Inventory Mapping*

   -

   *Current State*:
   - Team reviewed the Excel inventory of systems, identifying core
      applications like EDW, Tableau dashboards, MS Outlook, Excel,
ERP, CIP, Red
      chatbot, High Radius, Jira, banking portals, and Magento.
      - Noted discrepancies: High Radius was present in the general
      inventory but missing from the focused list of 82 systems;
resolved to add
      it.
      - Two flavors of High Radius noted: Collections (h r c, s a p, f s,
      cm, dca, fcsm) and Cash App/Cloud Producer.
   -

   *Discussion*:
   - Importance of mapping inventory names to =E2=80=9Cofficial=E2=80=9D ap=
plication names
      for consistency.
      - Action: Add columns in the tracker for both the reported name and
      the official name (possibly as new columns, A and B).
      - Identified the need for similar clarity for third-party portals,
      Jira, and others.
   -

   *Ownership Assignment*:
   - Confirmed that the system owner is the service owner (responsible, not
      the point of contact).
      - Emphasis on mapping the IT workstream and focal point to the system
      owner in the inventory, along with business/service owner.
      - Example: High Radius mapped to Finance as corporate work stream.
   -

   *Outstanding Issues*:
   - Many dashboards (e.g., Power BI) are not CMDB items and have unknown
      or undefined owners=E2=80=94these were marked for follow-up.

2. *Tracker Columns and Data Model Alignment*

   - *Core columns decided for the tracker*:
      - System name
      - Official inventory/app name
      - IT workstream lead/focal + Service owner
      - IT disposition (pulled from master inventory)
   - *Fields to be completed by business users*: Business UAT lead, test
   scenarios (these to be left blank for now).
   - *Responsibility clarifications*: Confirm supply chain applications,
   assign =E2=80=9CPromote=E2=80=9D as placeholder owner, but direct IT sup=
ply chain lead to
   confirm true owner.

3. *Preparation for Upcoming Monday Meeting*

   -

   *Agenda creation*:
   - Two major slides: Progress update and Call to Action (CTAs).
      - Continued debate on order: decided that =E2=80=9Cprogress update=E2=
=80=9D should
      precede the call to action.
   -

   *Call to Action (CTAs)*:
   - Populate and finalize UAT service owners/missing service owners in
      master tracker (for both Solstice and Honeywell).
      - Review and supply missing milestones for the consolidated testing
      schedule (esp. SIT/UAT).
      - Validate SIT/UAT test schedules and windows.
      - Participate in 1:1 functional alignment calls over the next two
      weeks (calls not yet scheduled/calendar to be mocked up as
example for team
      input).
      - Provide data/links/templates for each CTA, including =E2=80=9Cwhere=
 to add=E2=80=9D
      information (e.g., columns in the tracker). Suggest mock-ups and
      pre-populated columns.
      - Emphasis on clear, actionable instructions=E2=80=94possibly modeled=
 after
      previous PMO communication templates for deliverables.

4. *Dashboarding, Reporting, and Cutover Discussion*

   -

   *Overview Design*:
   - PMO dashboards will provide system inventory, cutover status, SIT/UAT
      progress tracked in Capital Edge (CE).
      - Reporting to be function-oriented, supporting both process and
      system views.
      - Recognized that these dashboarding activities, while important, are
      not the =E2=80=9Cbiggest fish to fry=E2=80=9D; focus must remain on U=
AT, process
alignment,
      and hypercare preparedness.
   -

   *Process vs. System Testing*:
   - Functional and process UAT is function-led, with scenarios defined and
      tested by business units using appropriate systems.
      - BRV process tracker will monitor process-level testing
      progress=E2=80=94tracking hires, KT, UAT scenarios, completion, etc.,
with focus on
      mapping each process to the appropriate systems and ensuring the righ=
t
      functional and IT owners are accountable.
      - Clarification that some systems are tested only as part of changed
      processes; TSAs may not require direct system-level UAT.

5. *Defect Management & Hypercare Models*

   - *Model Structure*:
      - *UAT Defect Escalation/Resolution*: Outlined for both systems and
      processes=E2=80=94clarified need to define who is contacted and the
escalation path
      for SEV1 defects.
      - *Go-Live Hypercare Model*: Process set for post-go-live
      support=E2=80=94procedure for raising issues immediately post-launch,
assignment of
      resolution responsibilities.

6. *Operational Alignment and MOS (Management Operating System)*

   - *Regular Alignment Calls*:
      - Plan to use alignment calls over the next two weeks to validate
      process/system mappings and synchronize cross-functional dependencies=
.
      - Post-alignment, set up recurring MOS meetings (weekly or bi-weekly)
      to review dashboards, escalate defects, monitor progress on UAT and
      hypercare, and adjust plans as needed.
      - Owners/process leads for end-to-end flows (Order-to-Cash,
      Procure-to-Pay, Record-to-Report, etc.) to be confirmed; align all
      functional and IT UAT coordinators.

7. *Process Tracker and System Mapping Discussions*

   - *Process Tracker Goals*:
      - Map supply chain, finance, and other processes to the right systems
      within the tracker, using function owners to define linkages.
      - Each process step may relate to several systems, requiring multiple
      owner inputs=E2=80=94clarified need for process teams to add line ite=
ms for all
      touched systems.
      - Tracking to shift toward process completion and scenario sign-offs
      rather than system-level checklists alone.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Update Master Application Inventory*:
   - Add missing apps (e.g., High Radius for collections and Cash App) and
      confirm all net new or TSA (Transition Service Agreement) systems.
      - Complete columns for reported name, official app name, IT
      workstream lead/focal, service owner, and IT disposition.
   2.

   *Identify & Finalize Service Owners*:
   - Each system (both in Honeywell and Solstice portfolios) must have a
      named IT and business/service owner.
      - Assign placeholders for unknowns (e.g., supply chain), but set
      clear responsibility for confirmation.
   3.

   *Prepare Monday Meeting Slides*:
   - Bullet-point two main agenda items (progress update, call to action).
      - Mock up trackers/slides with prepopulated column examples and
      provide distributable links/templates.
   4.

   *Populate Testing Schedules*:
   - Review consolidated testing Excel; provide any missing milestones,
      especially for SIT and UAT phases.
      - Validate all test windows, dates, and process the input for
      dashboarding.
   5.

   *Set Up & Communicate Alignment Calls*:
   - Draft a two-week meeting calendar for alignment calls by workstream;
      adjust as needed based on team feedback.
      - Confirm MOS (operating rhythm) post-alignment for ongoing dashboard
      reviews and cross-functional resolution.
   6.

   *Clarify Defect Escalation and Hypercare Models*:
   - Document process for UAT/service desk escalation, assign post-go-live
      hypercare responsibilities, and communicate these paths to all
      function/system owners.
   7.

   *Link Process & System-Level Testing in Trackers*:
   - Process owners to list all affected systems in process tracker and
      align with functional UAT scenarios.
      - Transfer necessary mappings into Capital Edge for centralized
      dashboarding/reporting.
   8.

   *Communicate Deliverables and Where to Add Information*:
   - For each CTA, provide clear instructions and direct links or
      screenshots/mocks indicating =E2=80=9Cwhere to update=E2=80=9D within=
 tools and trackers.

------------------------------
Follow-up

   - *Monday, June 9, 2025*: Review progress, clear outstanding system
   owner assignments, check status of all CTAs from today.
   - *Capital Edge Coordination*: Provide trackers/templates and data to
   Brian from the Capital Edge team for dashboard setup=E2=80=94send today.
   - *BRV Tracker Process Mapping*: Validate all process-to-system linkages
   in alignment calls and adjust trackers accordingly.
   - *Schedule Recurring MOS Calls*: Set up cadence for broader UAT and
   hypercare dashboard reviews.

------------------------------
ImagesImage 1 & 2 Summary

*Context*: Both images display a PowerPoint slide presenting a table that
summarizes the approach to systems and process implementation/testing
governance.
Key Visual Elements:

   -

   *Phased Approach*:
   - Lists end-to-end process coverage (Order-to-Cash, Procure-to-Pay,
      Record-to-Report) with designated process and function owners.
      - Aligns these processes with relevant system testing steps: SIT, UAT
      (function-led), go-lives.
   -

   *Integration with Tools*:
   - Columns indicate the use of Smartsheets/Capital Edge dashboards for
      tracking:
         - UAT scenarios
         - BRV process tracker status (hires, KT, UAT completion)
         - System inventory (296 in CE)
         - SIT/UAT/cutover dashboards
      -

   *Defect and Hypercare Models*:
   - Final column captures escalation and hypercare models for both UAT and
      go-live defect resolution.

Significance:

   - *Clarity on Governance*: The slides visually reinforce the connection
   between process/function ownership, system-level responsibilities, and
   tracking mechanisms via tools such as Smartsheets and CE dashboards.
   - *Defect Flow and Post-Go-Live Support*: The slides highlight the
   planned escalation/hypercare process for both system and process defects=
,
   ensuring ownership and responsibility are clearly defined throughout the
   lifecycle.
   - *Key for Communication*: Slides will be used in future meetings to
   align all stakeholders on cadence, task assignments, and the linkage
   between process, technology, and ownership.

------------------------------
Additional Notes

   - *Urgency*: Several deliverables are time-sensitive for next week
   (tracking updates, owner confirmations, meeting schedules).
   - *Team Alignment*: Regular communication and clear documentation are
   vital=E2=80=94the expectation is for owners to complete missing data and=
 be
   proactive in upcoming alignment sessions.
   - *Template Use*: Consistent template usage for trackers/slides will
   reduce confusion and improve completion.

------------------------------

*Next Steps:* All action items to be progressed before the Monday meeting,
with a summary status to be prepared in advance. Owners to respond to
specific CTAs and ensure clarity on deliverable expectations.

Rakesh0:00
And let's look through the Excel. So let me put agenda items on our chat.
So let's see. I'm just gonna. So that we understand. So it ise owners of
systems identified. And then two we've got the all IT connect deck three
we've got. So that's the content for it and call to action and then three,
three, three, three. What is the other one? The. The BRV Tracker 2
dashboard. Yeah. Okay. Give me ones.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)0:51
Yeah.
Rakesh0:52
Huh.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)0:53
I just said. All right. But yeah.
Rakesh0:54
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)0:55
Take your time.
Rakesh0:56
So all right. Okay. So all right. So where are we with the key system? So
on the left hand side we should have a view of what the. So if you move all
the way left. So these guys. EDW, you know, tableau dashboards, you know BI
tableau dashboards, Ms. Outlook and Excel ERP, CIP. Red is there. We should
have Red which is their chatbot. High Radius, we should have it. Jira, we
should have.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)1:31
Yeah, High Radius we should have. Right. But for some reason we don't.
Rakesh1:35
It should be in the app inventory. The overall app inventory.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)1:38
It's in the overall app inventory but it's not in our list of 82.
Rakesh1:43
Yeah. So we can add it to the list of 82 because it might be a TSA. So
there's not a list of build back and move as is. If it's in a T it could be
a build back or it could be a tsa. Right.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)1:54
Yeah.
Rakesh1:55
My point is these are the net new systems they're touching, they're not
necessarily changing. Or in this case of High Radius, it could be a SaaS
solution but we need to talk through who might be the owner. So Jira, we'd
have to understand. Okay. Banking portals. Okay. Magento I think is
something else in our.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)2:17
And so I think that the fundamental issue with this is that this file is
going to go into a black hole and it's never going to be useful for anyone
to actually like track or do reporting on. Because the key system names
reporting.
Rakesh2:32
Right, Understood. Okay.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)2:34
Because the key system names don't map to one for one, anything that we can
check against.
Rakesh2:42
For the most of these they do so like.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)2:45
But High Radius, like the. The true name for high. Well, there's two High
Radiuses. Right.
Rakesh2:50
There's in that this one is collections.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)2:53
Yeah. So there's High Radius, hrc, SAP, fs, cm, dca, fcsm.
Rakesh3:00
Yep, yep, yep.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)3:00
And then there's the other one, Cash App, Cloud Producer. And so.
Rakesh3:08
Okay, fair.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)3:09
In order to look up like any of the Details about High Radius and the way
that we're all tracking them. We need to use the name or use the.
Rakesh3:22
That's fine, that's fine, that's okay. So you can add, we can add a column
next to A that says here's the official name. Right. So if there is an app
like third party Portals, we may have to understand what that name is and
come back.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)3:42
Yeah, exactly.
Rakesh3:44
But we can at least add this as a column B that says this is the app name
in the inventory. And then if you have a pm. Who is that? So the IT work
stream would be, you know, ccex for example, if you've put, you know that.
So.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)4:06
And so that's what I wanted to understand with you is what, what does it
actually map to? Like in our tracker, these columns we had. Let me see,
where did I just go? The data model.
Rakesh4:28
I think it's not our tracker. Look at the master inventory. Yeah, the
Systems inventory, the 296. So technically, yes, our tracker because that
has everything. Fair enough. Our BRB inventory tracker.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)4:41
Yeah, but there's no, like CCEX is not in there. Right? Like it doesn't.
They have like the IT work stream is not in the master inventory.
Rakesh4:57
Yeah, it is, it should be.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)5:02
It might be hidden. Let me see. Oh, let me flip this one over to my other
screen. This is the master system inventory. Smartsheet.
Rakesh5:29
Okay.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)5:32
And high radius.
Rakesh5:34
So you can see that one is a business app, the other one's a tool and
utility. So, so high. So this is for collection. So it's, you know, give
the High Radius business app name. Right. So.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)5:52
Where would the.
Rakesh5:57
Be go to the left. This, this is column A. Column B. So what is what is
hidden? What is not hidden?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)6:06
A, B, C, D, E, F, G. See.
Rakesh6:15
Corporate work stream.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)6:22
Corporate work stream is finance.
Rakesh6:25
So you should have. Yeah, so we should have another view of this that says,
okay, this is a work stream. That's the finance. Or can you unfilter, for
example, I want to see what the corporate work stream is. Our master system
inventory should have all. There you go. So ccex, Finance, Engineering. Da,
da, da.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)6:46
Got it. So it's not. So like that's what threw me off, I guess is hearing
you say ccex. But High Radius is finance.
Rakesh6:54
Yeah, High Radius is finance. I was talking about Magento or other ones.
You put Stephen Brown on something. He's the service owner, he's the focal
for ccex.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)7:06
We don't have collections.
Rakesh7:10
Collections is just a process. It's an order. Management is the. So High
Radius Is is the cache collection app. So it's in collections, but it's
part of the same thing.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)7:23
And so.
Rakesh7:24
So if you look at down to.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)7:25
Like the procurement level. So, like they had ISC procurement apps.
Rakesh7:32
No, no, no, no.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)7:33
You're so and so.
Rakesh7:35
What are you trying to. No, it's not that person. It is. It is. What is
that app? That app. So it's not. So I am the function. I'm in charge of a
process, but I touch apps across the landscape. Who owns that app is what
we're trying to get. So if I touch an app in legal, who's the owner of that
app is what we're saying that app is illegal. Work it legal. That app is a
service owner. That is against that is what we're trying to get. Not.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)8:09
Who'S the point of contact.
Rakesh8:11
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not for this, but from going back to. Against here.
Right. So who is the focal for CCEX? Who's a focal for, you know, say this
app? ERP. CIP 900 is somebody owns ERP. So, you know, it's not promote. It
is, you know, srijib or, you know.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)8:38
Yeah. And so that's what I want to do right now. I want to be. I want to
get down to that level and be like, I'm going to document it very, very
clearly. So IT workstream is mapped to that master inventory, the corporate
works frame.
Rakesh8:57
Okay.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)9:07
The itpm. I based these on ISC and then.
Rakesh9:16
No, not ise. Who owns this app? EDW Data and Analytics. Who's the head of.
Who's our focal for data and analytics.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)9:30
Got it. So we have the focal person. We also have on the business side, the
service owner.
Rakesh9:39
The service owner. So you could put the focal point person and the service
owner. So focal is, I think, whatever the name we have, Rajesh something.
And then you could call in, you know, the service owner. You could call it
this.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)9:51
So it's the it works.
Rakesh9:52
IT workstream lead, Focal and then comma, service owner. Yep.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)10:21
Then the IT disposition for the.
Rakesh10:25
You should get from the master inventory for this app.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)10:29
What about the ones that are like, we don't. Can we just leave those?
Rakesh10:35
Well, you should be able to look up the word like, is there a gen AI? Is
there a robotic process automation or AI?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)10:46
My concern is not that there's not one match, it's just that there's BI
tableau dashboards.
Rakesh10:55
Okay, so do you have tableau or power bi? Yes.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)11:12
We have the tableau app itself.
Rakesh11:15
Power BI dashboard there. So that's a duplicate. So It's a non cmdb but we.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)11:22
Don'T have the actual owner of the whatever dashboards they're talking
about.
Rakesh11:27
Correct. So which is a fair point. So we have to talk to put that as given.
It's so leave those empty. We can make a call on you know, what's. What's
pending. For example, this is become things coming from supply chain team.
Finite functional team. So we can put promote as an example that says okay,
IT supply chain lead, you go figure out the owner.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)12:11
Yes. Okay, that makes sense. And so it disposition is the master obviously
business UAT lead.
Rakesh12:30
Go back to the resource tracker. So if we know that this is a supply chain
application, we can come in here and say who is the BA business lead. So
UAT coordinator here can be, you know. So if you see supply chain and let's
say that app is EDW and data and analytics, then we know it's. You know,
there's a name there.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)13:05
We don't have dni.
Rakesh13:08
Okay.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)13:09
That's on the list of.
Rakesh13:14
So we don't need business. I think we only need the first few letters.
First thing, first few business UAT he can fill up. That's for him to
provide, not us. So these other ones. Don't worry, it's just the first few
till it disposition. What's the last two columns?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)13:48
They will fill these out.
Rakesh13:49
Test scenarios. Those are for business.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)13:51
Yeah, exactly.
Rakesh13:53
So yeah, just fill till F. Okay.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)13:55
Yeah, I can do that.
Rakesh13:58
Cool. All right, so that's one. Let's. Let's talk through what we want to.
What do you think we should talk about on Monday?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)14:08
So I put that. Let me see.
Rakesh14:10
Yeah, open up that PowerPoint and we can put some bullet points around the
agenda items. Let's look at your agenda items and then now let's create
another agenda slide.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)14:52
For the agenda. I mean the agenda is really two slides. It's a progress
update and then call to action or the reverse order of that.
Rakesh15:05
I would want to. But let's, let's put the bullet points on what is it? So
what is it you want to provide? Provide on progress update.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)15:17
I think that we should do probably the call to action first for time.
Rakesh15:26
No, no, let's keep progress update. We can, we can move it on later. So
what is your call to action then?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)15:33
There's. I mean it's these items. Like these are the things that we will
need them to do tomorrow. Populate the system service owners in the master
tracker. That's on the Honeywell side for Athens.
Rakesh15:47
Do you want. For Honeywell or Solstice or both for.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)15:51
Solstice and for the Honeywell ones that are missing.
Rakesh15:54
Okay. So let's just put that as a bullet point. So call to action would be
uat, finalize UAT service owners or identify and complete UAT services or
service owners. Okay, what's. What else do they need to do?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)16:31
I would say review you that excel of the consolidated testing schedule and
provide any of the missing milestones like sit, the ones that you asked for
today. Any additional details that they have around UAT or SIT that we
haven't captured from our.
Rakesh16:52
What if they tell us it's in our work plan?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)16:59
So, okay, that's the next one. I mean that's really this. It's like we
could take this and pull it out. But I think the work plan, like the other
call to action was to update the work plans and let's go ahead.
Rakesh17:16
Okay. So instead let's say, you know, update, you know, validate, you know,
SIT UAT test schedules. Because we are again, we could publish it at an app
level. We could show the example of the. But what that doesn't show is and
I don't think Paul Jeff received that slide too well. He was like, yeah,
this doesn't tell me much. I'm more interested. This is very System view. I
want a process view. So validate SIT and UAT test dates. Yeah. And
schedule. That's fine. Okay, what else do we want to test? Windows. Test
dates and Windows, if you want to put it.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)18:21
I had like a f, like. Please join the calls that you set up tomorrow to do
that process alignment with the leads.
Rakesh18:35
Okay, so participate. The next call to action is participate in one on one
in functional alignment calls.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)19:15
Yep.
Rakesh19:18
Those calls need to go out and they have not gone out. But yeah. Okay, what
else do they need to do? So for each of these we need to provide some data
like we need. Here's the thing that you need to go complete. So there's a
link here associated with it or validate these dates. So if we have a
smartsheet, we need to link it to that smartsheet. If you're saying
participate in here, we should have a calendar view to say, okay, these are
the calendars that. This is a calendar that you need to participate
accordingly. So for each of these.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)19:59
I can add the column names.
Rakesh20:03
Yeah, column names. I don't necessarily. It's not this, you know, we can
explain that in the separate tab or the separate sheet you add. Yeah, but I
would like where exactly? So if you're going to give a mock up or a copy
paste of what they need to go add. I would suggest you, you create wherever
they need to add and go add some comments in there that they say, you know,
that they need to do this, they need to do that here. What I mean by that
is something like this. Give me a second. Brv, where is the BRV tracker?
Find the darn thing, prod, cut over. Okay, but I can send you an example,
but I think you get what I need. Hopefully you do, but.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)21:19
Kind of. Do you mean create like, like something very specific for them to
fill out with. Like, like don't link to the systems tracker, create a.
Rakesh21:35
I'm. No, no. Well explain what you're saying. And I, I'm trying to find
what I want to show you as you know what the tracker would be, what I mean
and pmo, pmo, pmo.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)21:48
Where is ultimately these UAT service owners go into our systems tracker
which, which gets loaded into Capital Edge. Like that's their end
destination.
Rakesh22:03
Okay. And so where do they need to go populate.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)22:07
They need to put it in the systems tracker in the two columns that I've
already pre filled. One for Honeywell and the Athens one is blank.
Rakesh22:16
Okay, so then let's show that copy of that systems tracker and mock up what
it looks like and the columns they need to fill. So I'm trying to get you
an example of what I'm referring to as kind of, you know, the, the slide
that we're, we're looking to show there.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)22:39
What was it called? The deck.
Rakesh22:41
It's not any, it's not any deck. I'm trying to. There's one of these older
PMO communications that talked about go here and do this, you know, go here
and do that. Like for a gate deliverable. Go fill this template out. So
what I'm trying to show us is like this is you know, an example from them
that says, you know, for example from the PMO when they asked us to fill
something out. I'm trying to get that example of. Okay, you know, do this.
So, so let me look at this one for example. I just want to, I know I'm not
sharing anything. I just want to open up what I've, I want to share the
right one with you.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)23:31
So yeah, take your time.
Rakesh23:34
And this is simply to mock up my point if I can find the darn thing. But
while I do that, let's talk through what else do they need to do for the
activities that they ask of them. So participate in functional calls means
we need to have detailed calendar and mos. So if you want to mock up a
calendar, I can go in and populate when these meetings are. So if you want
to mock up a calendar over the next couple of weeks and I started doing
something on the other side of it. But if you want to mock up.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)24:34
What that, that Excel.
Rakesh24:36
Yeah, yeah. If you just want to mock up, you know, a two week calendar, I
can go in and say this, you know, these teams here, these teams there.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)24:46
Yeah. The thing with that is I think that some of the MOS though is like
going to be a result of that process, like cross functional dependency
mapping that we're doing in the calls tomorrow. So like in the call
tomorrow with the work streams where we are saying let's validate the
processes and let's validate the systems and from there you can identify
like what are the cross functional interdependencies. Like this system goes
out and touches or this process touches this system and this process
touches this other HR system system. Right.
Rakesh25:33
All I'm asking is put a calendar of when we're going to meet to do that.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)25:38
Yeah, tomorrow. I think we just have like two tomorrow, right?
Rakesh25:41
No, it doesn't matter. Just put it for two weeks. Okay, but, but like, you
know, okay, I'm meeting, you know, I'm meeting this function Monday, I'm
meeting these other function Wednesday. Again, it's a, it's a placeholder
that we're sharing and saying here's our calendar for the next two weeks.
Weeks of where we're meeting with you. Yeah, people can pipe up and say, oh
no, Wednesday doesn't work, Thursday does. Okay, you can move it to
Thursday. But okay, calendar view, we want to show of when we're meeting
people for the next two weeks.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)26:08
Okay, easy.
Rakesh26:11
Okay, so that one is the alignment calls where we need to showcase a two
week calendar. Now the other one I want to. Okay, so anything else?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)26:24
That's all I had on my CTAs.
Rakesh26:26
Okay, what else did you have on the other side? So go back to your slide
one.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)26:36
These are like the overall priorities for the week. This is like the FYI
dashboard and reporting the update is that we finalized the data model. We
need inputs from the worst room owners on some of the gaps. And we are
working to prepare dashboards for the system and the process mapping view.
The MOS calls will validate the processes and the systems and the PMO is
going to build the dashboards.
Rakesh27:01
So. Yeah, so on the grand scheme of things, this PMO dashboard for the
system inventory is going to be a. I Hate to say it, but it's like it's,
it's, it's not a big thing in the grand scheme of things that need to
happen. Meaning there are bigger fish to fry for us. So the, the UAT is one
piece of it. So if you think about this way and again, tell me how much
experience you have done in your past one on cutovers and process cutovers
and uat.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)27:36
Not very much. But are you talking about the hypercare piece?
Rakesh27:39
Not just the hypercare piece. So if you think about it, and I want to maybe
layer out this thing, let me share my screen and I will pencil draw things
and we can talk through what I'm trying to convey the message on.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)27:51
Definitely. Yeah. I think zooming out would be great. Like if there are
bigger fish to fry in the grand scheme of like where we're going with uat.
Yeah, hit me.
Rakesh28:00
So let me do this. And this is what Jeff is looking for. And let's do this.
What do I want? Yeah, fine. All right, so if you think about one, these are
at the first level you've got systems that go through sit UAT and go lives.
And for the uat you've got. And so systems go through these. And this is
our system tracker that we have. And we're doing the Capital Edge
smartsheet to Capital Edge dashboard that we're looking with. What was his
name? Rob or. No, Brian.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)29:07
Brian.
Rakesh29:08
Brian from the Capital Edge team. So we'll need to send that to him today
so he can take a look. So these are our typical SDLC stuff where We've got
these 84 systems that are just cutting over for build back and move as is.
And that's a. On a path, on its own. And some of them get involved with a
function, some of them don't. So that has our system in system inventory
Tracker of the 296in capital edge. And what we did is look at the
smartsheet and the dashboard for that. So that we need now these, we're
going to have a hypercare for when the systems break, when they go live,
there are issues. So there'll be some hypercare model for even post uat and
you know, UAT defect escalation as well as go live hypercare models. So by
that I mean, okay, I have a uat, something breaks, the scenario is not
tested, the function says, yay, this is not working. There's a. I don't
have access, not even access. I run this test and it breaks, it doesn't
work. It's a sev1 defect then I've got to go through the defect resolution
process to so there needs to be some model defect escalation resolution
model. In the meantime there's a go live hypercare model when let's say
something goes live on August 17, if there's an issue with it, how do
people call once that system is live, who do they call? How do things get
resolved? So there's a broader concept around here but we're starting with
showing a smartsheet to more of a capital edge dashboard on sit UAT
progress and cutover dashboard. And this is by function and etc. However,
we want to slice it from a function perspective. There are processes that
are changing. So for these they're going to test UAT and go lives on these
processes. The UAT are against the systems. So they will test and even in
here this u UAT is kind of function led so it will prepare the scripts. The
UAT guys will the functions will do the UAT on these systems and test
certain scenarios and say okay, this is a brand new system of a clone.
We're testing certain UAT scenarios and that's good and it's done. There's
a portion of it or a system separate layer of it that is functional and
process uat. So I have processes that are changing that I now need to touch
the systems to verify these processes. Let us say I need to, you know
there's a new process or an existing process that's in a new system that I
now need to go re verify the process or redo the process or the process was
this way in Honeywell where doing it a little differently in Athens. I now
need to check that process. So that is mostly legal entity related if you
will and that has again a tracker that's the BRB process tracker that is
going to be, you know what tree was sharing about, you know where is my
hires? Where are my kt? Is it done? Is my UAT scenarios done?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)32:55
Where is that?
Rakesh32:55
Is my UAT complete? That is what she was sharing in the BRV process.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)33:01
Yeah, but they don't have it to the. Oh yeah. So they have it to the
function, but they don't have it to systems.
Rakesh33:07
No, it's not. It doesn't matter. This is process.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)33:10
It does. I mean it you wrote like UAT dash systems like yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rakesh33:18
So what I mean by that is the systems are not that important in the scheme
of things. So they are important but this is purely function led and these
alignment calls that we're going to have are around here.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)33:31
So the BRV process tracker, how is that actionable without knowing okay,
what do we actually have to go test?
Rakesh33:38
Well, because that is where the UAT coordinators and this is where the
alignment call is. So. So two separate things. There will be a provision in
there that similar. You see the sheet that this guy sent promote that I
sent you. He's got all these systems that he's touching and one of the
other tabs. He's got all the processes and supply chain against these
systems. So if you look at his tracker, it actually has processes touching
against the same systems.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)34:08
Yeah, that's what is trying to find. Tried to do like is he tried to but
it's not complete. I think that that's what they said on the ISC call last.
It was on Monday.
Rakesh34:20
For a few. For a few. But he has for many. Yeah, so. So what he's done is
I've got a hundred processes to do this process. This process is in the
erp. Okay, so the system I touch is an erp. Who's the servant? So he's
listed ERP as a line item in our tab and saying who's the owner of erp? So
I can connect with this person and go get this information. So what ISP is
going to do is check processes that are changing. They're going to map the
UAP for these processes touching whatever systems it is. You know, let's
say some procurement system or you know, sales source for something for
commercial orders or ERP etc. That please go to retouching. The process
tracker has a view of the systems of saying okay, this process, you know,
may touch five systems but the tracker is really tracking progress in the
process. So where are my hires? What are my. Is my knowledge transfer
complete? For me to start the UAT for processes, I need the right people
that are running those processes or owning those processes. Have I defined
my scenarios to test for those processes, have I completed UAT, have I
signed off, etc. So and then where there's a process defect, there is again
a hypercare model, a process defect hyper care model that's not systems
related but it could be like oh, I tried this process of entering and
creating a new customer. So let's say order management, I want to take a
new order, but it's for a new customer. So I have the I as a supply chain
guy may go in and say or maybe it's a commercial guy that goes in and says
I need to put in a new order that's in salesforce Salesforce is not
changing up all because it's a TS8 system. But I'm touching Salesforce to
enter a new order so it won't fall in this bottom 84 because it's not.
There's no UAT happening there. Or sit because it's not there. It's a tsa.
So it won't show up here. It will show up here. On it will show up here
saying, okay, I have a process that's changing. I now need to create a new
customer or my change. The way I create a customer is different. I need to
use that Salesforce systems to test this uat. So that's why he's asking for
the service owner for that Salesforce. So when he's doing this process
testing, he's going to be able to go against that person and say, okay, I'm
viewing a UAT against this. Pierce, you're the UAT coordinator. We have to
work with you to make sure that the UAT works here. And then the process
tracker is really from Capital Edge that does at a high level that says,
I've tested 20 processes, I've completed 15 of them, five are pending, etc.
So are you with me thus far?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)37:28
Yeah. Oh yeah, I couldn't get off mute. Yeah, I'm with you so far. Sorry,
I'm just, I'm eating at the same time. But yeah, I agree with you. But to
get to the. I'm just thinking about like the operationalization and making
this tactical and so to get process defects out of it. When you're actually
testing these things, you need to know what system it is connected to.
Right. And so that BRV process tracker right now is like functionally
useless because it's supposed to serve the purpose of what Promode is
putting together.
Rakesh38:16
No, it's not. So if you recall, what Pre and Jen mentioned on our call
earlier this week was you've got the 295 system that will be tagged to it.
If you recall, we particularly talked about this step where we said how are
others going to know what systems they touch? So if you recollect, PRI and
Jen mentioned that the process teams are going to come in and enter
different rows that say ISE is touching this system in the uat. Do you
recollect that conversation?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)38:57
Yeah. Is that when we were talking about like the WBS linkages?
Rakesh39:01
No, it's not the WPS linkage.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)39:04
I, I mean I do remember we only had one conversation with Pre so.
Rakesh39:08
And Jan where yeah, we said there are 296 when we said there are only 296
rows for systems. Why do you have more rows? She walked us through and said
it if you filter by it, you can run a report on it because that will be for
your IT UAT stuff. Yeah, these other rows of 100 other rows have been
entered by Finance and supply chain etc. Yeah, we talked about that. ERP
would be entered five times because different systems are different
functions are touching it.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)39:40
Yes.
Rakesh39:42
So that is where the list you're developing for supply chain, 17 or 18 rows
are going to be mapped against in these alignment calls. And Sriram is
going to go into that tracker and say for this supply chain process, I'm
touching this system, this system, this system, three rows. He'll go in and
say for this other supply chain process, I'm touching ERP again, I'm
touching this, I'm touching that. So seven systems. But he will tag that
against the function supply chain. So to answer your question of how are we
tracking that tracker there will be dashboard run on it to again he will
come in and say have I completed this process? If I have, then I'm going to
mark complete against these three systems.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)40:32
Yeah.
Rakesh40:35
Right. So that's what's going to happen with this mapping and this
alignment calls where we get the systems mapped to their processes. Not one
for one but whatever they need. And then the ask would be for them to go
into that tracker in Capital Edge and put those line items there. They have
to enter it a thousand lines, they enter it a thousand times, they maintain
it and say supply chain, I'm touching the system six times, four.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)41:00
Times seven processes and that way you keep it. Yeah, okay, yes, I'm
aligned.
Rakesh41:04
It doesn't touch the it portion, it doesn't touch the 296.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)41:07
Yeah.
Rakesh41:09
Now on top of this you have end to end processes which are order to cache,
you know, procure, to pay record, to report whatever other processes they
have that is actually just a few is a very small set, it's not thousands,
it's probably less than 100. For these processes there are only so many
process steps and they again similarly you could call it as a subset of
this entire functional process, but it is actually cross functional because
I might touch commercial here, I might touch supply chain there, I might
touch, you know, I might touch different systems across different
functions. So this again we have to find out where exactly if this is not
in the Capital Edge, it could be in Smartsheets or Capital Edge where they
do the same thing where you're going to have Potentially this end to end
process owner or and you're going to have here I'm going to say this is it
UAT coordinator, this would be function UAT coordinator or poc. This would
also be end to end process owner/function PoC that the names they've given.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)42:50
Can we confirm a named owner for each end to end process?
Rakesh42:54
That's what you have in the resource tracker.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)42:59
Yeah, like order to cache, procure to pay, right? Yeah.
Rakesh43:02
Okay, so that's what's there. Now it doesn't fit nicely with it because if
you think of order to cache I'm touching Salesforce, I'm touching erp, I'm
touching whatever other systems and I'm going to have multiple service
owners because Salesforce is ccex. So I need to bring in Steven Brown plus
the service owner for this for erp I need to bring in who is it Harry or
Shrijib and multiple people for other things. So that's where it gets
tougher and trickier because I'm not dealing with an end to end cross
functional process and cross functional systems, not cross functional multi
systems that I now need to do and manage. So similarly there will just be
similar UAT scenarios complete and you know, scenarios defined complete and
tracking. Right. So this would be a subset of the requirements reporting
where we say okay, I've got 25 processes end to end and I manage this. More
from okay, have I done this process? Have I touched the 17 systems I need
to touch and working? Have I reported on if I only have 25 line items I go
in and say okay, I've completed this process, I've completed that process.
End to end process, right?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)44:25
Yes.
Rakesh44:26
So that is again in here you're going to have potentially process defects
and again a hypercare model. So everything that we have been doing and
focusing on today and what we are touching on is this and so what we're
asking our people for call to action is go do some of this stuff for I
connect it all this, you know the identify service owners and all the
systems get your sit UAT dates, yada yada, everything in there. So we need
to do that and keep this hygiene well we also need them to align here and
sit on these alignment calls to say I need you guys to start defining these
scenarios with them. The test scripts understand the system owners,
understand your windows, understand who will participate in these
functional versus UATs that are going to touch the system. So if the
systems are changing you guys are doing it fine. But you also need if the
systems are just getting Touched. You need to be there to make sure that
there isn't a system issue. So that's what these alignment calls will also
do is twofold. One, because this UAT is function led, there will be some
conversation around, when are you going to do this? Let me give you the
windows, let me go test this. And then the rest of the conversation would
be around, how do I coordinate this? How do I set up an MOS between these
functions, the functional UAT guys and the peers. So I should also add here=
.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)46:03
Yeah. Who needs to be in that box?
Rakesh46:06
Who needs to be in that box to have a weekly mosquito between, say, IT and
supply chain, IT and finance. Forget the alignment calls over the next week
or two. But this whole thing will take three weeks.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)46:18
Exactly.
Rakesh46:20
So I need like a, you know, maybe twice a week call or once a week call
where they look at dashboards and they go, oh, you've run these functions,
you ran into issues. How many SEP ones, how many defects sorted, da, da,
da. Similarly here, end to end process. How do I do this again? So this is
where we need the same thing. Process owners and then it uat. So this is
the MOS I'm talking about. Yeah, that we need to set up. Not the next two
weeks, but the broader MOS around. How do they run uat?
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)46:53
Yes. Look, Rakesh, I have to run downstairs and can I call you at 6:05?
Rakesh47:01
Yeah, take your time.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)47:02
Yeah, sorry, I've got other, lots of.
Rakesh47:03
Other stuff to do.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)47:04
Yeah, this. I have to go get my glasses from downstairs and they close it
at 4, so I'll call you.
Rakesh47:11
No worries. Take your time.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)47:12
Yeah, thanks.
Rakesh47:12
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no worries.
Unidentified (possibly a project manager or analyst)47:13
All right, thanks, bye.

ory Mapping</strong></h3><ul>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Current State</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Team reviewed the Excel inventory of systems, identifying core applicat=
ions like EDW, Tableau dashboards, MS Outlook, Excel, ERP, CIP, Red chatbot=
, High Radius, Jira, banking portals, and Magento.</li>
<li>Noted discrepancies: High Radius was present in the general inventory b=
ut missing from the focused list of 82 systems; resolved to add it.</li>
<li>Two flavors of High Radius noted: Collections (h r c, s a p, f s, cm, d=
ca, fcsm) and Cash App/Cloud Producer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Discussion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importance of mapping inventory names to =E2=80=9Cofficial=E2=80=9D app=
lication names for consistency.</li>
<li>Action: Add columns in the tracker for both the reported name and the o=
fficial name (possibly as new columns, A and B).</li>
<li>Identified the need for similar clarity for third-party portals, Jira, =
and others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Ownership Assignment</strong>:</p=
>
<ul>
<li>Confirmed that the system owner is the service owner (responsible, not =
the point of contact).</li>
<li>Emphasis on mapping the IT workstream and focal point to the system own=
er in the inventory, along with business/service owner.</li>
<li>Example: High Radius mapped to Finance as corporate work stream.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Outstanding Issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many dashboards (e.g., Power BI) are not CMDB items and have unknown or=
 undefined owners=E2=80=94these were marked for follow-up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Agenda creation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two major slides: Progress update and Call to Action (CTAs).</li>
<li>Continued debate on order: decided that =E2=80=9Cprogress update=E2=80=

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Call to Action (CTAs)</strong>:</=
p>
<ul>
<li>Populate and finalize UAT service owners/missing service owners in mast=

<li>Review and supply missing milestones for the consolidated testing sched=
ule (esp. SIT/UAT).</li>
<li>Validate SIT/UAT test schedules and windows.</li>
<li>Participate in 1:1 functional alignment calls over the next two weeks (=
calls not yet scheduled/calendar to be mocked up as example for team input)=
.</li>
<li>Provide data/links/templates for each CTA, including =E2=80=9Cwhere to =
add=E2=80=9D information (e.g., columns in the tracker). Suggest mock-ups a=

39;ll need to send that to him today so he can take a look. So these are ou=
r typical SDLC stuff where We&#39;ve got these 84 systems that are just cut=
ting over for build back and move as is. And that&#39;s a. On a path, on it=
s own. And some of them get involved with a function, some of them don&#39;=
t. So that has our system in system inventory Tracker of the 296in capital =
edge. And what we did is look at the smartsheet and the dashboard for that.=
 So that we need now these, we&#39;re going to have a hypercare for when th=
e systems break, when they go live, there are issues. So there&#39;ll be so=
me hypercare model for even post uat and you know, UAT defect escalation as=
 well as go live hypercare models. So by that I mean, okay, I have a uat, s=
omething breaks, the scenario is not tested, the function says, yay, this i=
s not working. There&#39;s a. I don&#39;t have access, not even access. I r=
un this test and it breaks, it doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s a sev1 defect the=
n I&#39;ve got to go through the defect resolution process to so there need=
s to be some model defect escalation resolution model. In the meantime ther=
e&#39;s a go live hypercare model when let&#39;s say something goes live on=
 August 17, if there&#39;s an issue with it, how do people call once that s=
ystem is live, who do they call? How do things get resolved? So there&#39;s=
 a broader concept around here but we&#39;re starting with showing a smarts=
heet to more of a capital edge dashboard on sit UAT progress and cutover da=
shboard. And this is by function and etc. However, we want to slice it from=
 a function perspective. There are processes that are changing. So for thes=
e they&#39;re going to test UAT and go lives on these processes. The UAT ar=
e against the systems. So they will test and even in here this u UAT is kin=
d of function led so it will prepare the scripts. The UAT guys will the fun=
ctions will do the UAT on these systems and test certain scenarios and say =
okay, this is a brand new system of a clone. We&#39;re testing certain UAT =
scenarios and that&#39;s good and it&#39;s done. There&#39;s a portion of i=
t or a system separate layer of it that is functional and process uat. So I=
 have processes that are changing that I now need to touch the systems to v=
erify these processes. Let us say I need to, you know there&#39;s a new pro=
cess or an existing process that&#39;s in a new system that I now need to g=
o re verify the process or redo the process or the process was this way in =
Honeywell where doing it a little differently in Athens. I now need to chec=
k that process. So that is mostly legal entity related if you will and that=
 has again a tracker that&#39;s the BRB process tracker that is going to be=
, you know what tree was sharing about, you know where is my hires? Where a=
re my kt? Is it done? Is my UAT scenarios done?</div></div><div style=3D"ma=

p. Who&#39;s the servant? So he&#39;s listed ERP as a line item in our tab =
and saying who&#39;s the owner of erp? So I can connect with this person an=
d go get this information. So what ISP is going to do is check processes th=
at are changing. They&#39;re going to map the UAP for these processes touch=
ing whatever systems it is. You know, let&#39;s say some procurement system=
 or you know, sales source for something for commercial orders or ERP etc. =
That please go to retouching. The process tracker has a view of the systems=
 of saying okay, this process, you know, may touch five systems but the tra=
cker is really tracking progress in the process. So where are my hires? Wha=
t are my. Is my knowledge transfer complete? For me to start the UAT for pr=
ocesses, I need the right people that are running those processes or owning=
 those processes. Have I defined my scenarios to test for those processes, =
have I completed UAT, have I signed off, etc. So and then where there&#39;s=
 a process defect, there is again a hypercare model, a process defect hyper=
 care model that&#39;s not systems related but it could be like oh, I tried=
 this process of entering and creating a new customer. So let&#39;s say ord=
er management, I want to take a new order, but it&#39;s for a new customer.=
 So I have the I as a supply chain guy may go in and say or maybe it&#39;s =
a commercial guy that goes in and says I need to put in a new order that&#3=
9;s in salesforce Salesforce is not changing up all because it&#39;s a TS8 =
system. But I&#39;m touching Salesforce to enter a new order so it won&#39;=
t fall in this bottom 84 because it&#39;s not. There&#39;s no UAT happening=
 there. Or sit because it&#39;s not there. It&#39;s a tsa. So it won&#39;t =
show up here. It will show up here. On it will show up here saying, okay, I=
 have a process that&#39;s changing. I now need to create a new customer or=
 my change. The way I create a customer is different. I need to use that Sa=
lesforce systems to test this uat. So that&#39;s why he&#39;s asking for th=
e service owner for that Salesforce. So when he&#39;s doing this process te=
sting, he&#39;s going to be able to go against that person and say, okay, I=
&#39;m viewing a UAT against this. Pierce, you&#39;re the UAT coordinator. =
We have to work with you to make sure that the UAT works here. And then the=
 process tracker is really from Capital Edge that does at a high level that=
 says, I&#39;ve tested 20 processes, I&#39;ve completed 15 of them, five ar=
