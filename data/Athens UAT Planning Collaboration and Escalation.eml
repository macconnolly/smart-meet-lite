Meeting Summary: Athens UAT Planning Session

*Date:* June 17, 2025
*Meeting Title:* Athens UAT Mid Day TB
------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *UAT Functional Lead & Tester Identification*

   - *Challenge:* Uncertainty about who should be listed as UAT functional
   leads and testers for various modules=E2=80=94especially within SAP FSCM=
 and
   related sub-processes.
   - *Resolution:*
      - An updated list of tester names for FSCM was sourced from business
      contacts and shared in both the chat and an Excel tracker for clarity=
.
      - For =E2=80=9CHoneywell UOP Credit=E2=80=9D only Nicholas has been i=
dentified as a
      tester; the team acknowledged a shortfall in the recommended number o=
f
      testers (three per process/module).
      - Org chart gaps remain=E2=80=94several teams have either insufficien=
t
      testers or only one functional expert available.

2. *Documentation and Tracker Updates*

   - *Artifacts Shared:*
      - Excel sheets tracking assignment of UAT leads and testers per
      stream (Credit, Collections, Disputes).
      - Links provided to both tester assignments and test script
      repositories.
      - Defect management trackers for both manual (finance-side) and
      automated (ERP-side) testing were discussed, with a standardized appr=
oach
      still needed.
   - *Linking and Integration:*
      - Proposal to reference existing Excel files for comprehensive
      scenario coverage and avoid duplicating data across trackers.
      - Plan to timestamp shared files and establish a single source of
      truth for reviewer convenience.

3. *Module/Stream-Specific Assignments and Risks*

   - *System Cross-Pollination:* Noted that some testers, such as Nicholas,
   support multiple SPGs (UOP, AM), and many newly hired personnel (e.g., C=
had
   for Workiva) have not yet been onboarded or fully trained.
   - *Known Org Gaps:*
      - Explicit risks identified for cases where only one qualified tester
      exists for critical business processes (e.g., Credit Transformation).
      - Need to note risk and escalate where business units lack sufficient
      testers/coverage.
      - Focus on validating tester names for each workstream, especially
      for coverage/backup in cases of absence.

4. *Testing Process Details*

   - *Manual vs. Automated Testing:*
      - Finance-side testing is fully manual (Excel-based scripts and
      defect tracking).
      - ERP-side will be primarily automated (Tosca), with a need to
      clarify which scenarios remain manual and link those appropriately.
   - *Workflow Documentation:*
      - Requirements to detail for each process: test scripts, scenario
      coverage, automation status, validation and sign-off ownership,
and defect
      tracking location.
      - Agreement to maintain separate workbooks for Finance (manual) and
      ERP (automated), with clear referencing and segmentation.

5. *Calendaring & Sequencing of UAT*

   - *Status:*
      - UAT sequencing and scheduling (=E2=80=9Ccalendaring=E2=80=9D) for t=
he upcoming
      two-week window is in progress.
      - Blockers: Lack of final tester lists, pending business user
      availability (notably Hyperion users unavailable the week of June 30 =
for
      consolidation/reporting).
   - *Next Steps:*
      - Commitment to produce a draft scheduling view (=E2=80=9Cversion 1=
=E2=80=9D) by
      tomorrow or the day after.
      - Emphasis on the need for input from both finance and ERP teams to
      ensure overlapping resources are properly sequenced.
   - *Communication Dependencies:*
      - Communicating UAT participation, timelines, and expectations is
      pending finalization of names and scheduling; urgency expressed to av=
oid
      delays in business notifications.

6. *Escalation & Follow-up on Gaps*

   - *Immediate Gaps:*
      - Several applications=E2=80=94tax for Mexico and Romania, Workiva,
      Blackline=E2=80=94lack assigned testers or business leads.
      - New hires cited, but not sufficiently onboarded (e.g., Chad for
      Workiva).
      - Discussion on leveraging knowledge transfer structures
      (pitcher/catcher) to fill temporary gaps.
   - *Escalation Path:*
      - Will Johnson is the escalation point for unresolved finance-side
      gaps.
      - Action plan to identify and mark gaps (color-code, e.g., red) for
      escalation by leadership as needed.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Finalize UAT Tester Assignments*
   - Jessica & Vicki to validate, populate, and escalate as needed for all
      modules and processes where fewer than three testers are available, u=
sing
      latest data from business leads.
      - Srinivas to provide missing tester names for tax (Mexico/Romania),
      Workiva, and Blackline. If unavailable, escalate to Will Johnson or
      appropriate leadership.
   2.

   *Update and Distribute Tracking Artifacts*
   - Rakesh to link Excel-based tester lists to the overarching scenario
      and BRV trackers.
      - Mac to move all received files into the Athens UAT shared folder
      and timestamp versions for reference.
      - Confirm and highlight risks/gaps in tracker comments/remarks
      columns.
   3.

   *Defect Tracking Consistency*
   - Alignment required on one defect tracker per workstream (ERP/Tosca for
      automated, Excel for manual).
      - Add notes/links to each tracker for clarity as to the tool/method
      used.
   4.

   *UAT Calendaring*
   - Srinivas and Bill to draft initial calendar views for both Finance
      (manual) and ERP (automated) UAT windows.
      - Identify blackout periods (e.g., June 30=E2=80=93July 4, Hyperion u=
ser
      unavailability) and flag these in the calendar.
   5.

   *Communication Plan*
   - Once tester names and calendars are validated, Jessica to draft and
      distribute participation communications, setting expectations and
      requesting business user vacation blackout/availability information.
   6.

   *Escalation of Gaps*
   - Immediate escalation for:
         - Tax testing resources for Mexico/Romania.
         - Lack of testers for Workiva and Blackline.
         - Any other process with less than three testers or where UAT
         responsibility is not clearly assigned.
      7.

   *Follow-on Coordination*
   - Schedule targeted working sessions with Srinivas, Rakesh, Vicki, and
      Jessica to go line-by-line through the red/gap areas post-call.
      - Connect with Will Johnson regarding finance-side escalation as
      needed.

------------------------------
Follow-up Points

   - *Daily/Ad-hoc Working Sessions:*
      - Additional smaller, targeted meetings to address and close
      resource/tester assignment gaps, with escalation if not rapidly resol=
ved.
   - *Reporting for Sukai Readiness Review (Tomorrow Morning):*
      - Commitment to prepare a comprehensive deliverable for
      workstream/tester/scenario coverage matrix and calendaring for tomorr=
ow=E2=80=99s
      session with Sukai.
   - *End-of-Day 3:30/4:30 PM Check-In:*
      - Bill to forward invite to ERP team. Key milestone to confirm ERP
      automation coverage, scenario/tester assignment, and calendar status.
   - *All-Hands Communication/Program Readiness:*
      - Updated UAT readiness and sequencing slide to be shared at the
      OpSep all-hands call tomorrow, with additional underlying detail as
      required.

Jessica0:00
Who's the best person to connect with to make sure we have the right people
in this UAT functional lead column here?
Bill0:08
Because I am, I guess, but I mean I'm relying. I don't know who any of
these people are.
Srinivas0:14
Yeah. So I think I can help you out with this one. Do you want to filter
by? I'm not sure what filters are applied. This is for fscm. SAP fscm.
Right. So Chase Davidson, I'm not sure why his name is on there, but let me
get to the names. Just give me one moment. I'm just trying to plug. Okay,
I'm going to ping the names here in the chart window for you just to make
it easier. These are the names for fscm. Basically FSCM includes your
credit collection display. These are the names that will be participating
in the uatn. These are the names that we have received from them and from
the business.
Jessica1:27
Okay, so those are the names that should be in column O.
Srinivas1:31
Yes, that's correct.
Jessica1:34
Okay, so is there a list of those names somewhere?
Srinivas1:40
Can I share my screen for a quick one minute?
Jessica1:43
Yeah, absolutely.
Srinivas1:44
Give me a second. So I think I had a call. I think we all had a call.
Myself, Bill and team here with Rakesh and I was walking him through this
list. I know based on our meeting this morning with Sukai, I kind of put
together some information for you so that make it easier for tomorrow's
readout and then to your call session. Okay, just give me a second. Then
again, my Excel sheet only talks about for non ERP applications. Right.
Bill will cover for ERP applications. So here is an Excel sheet again I'm
going to ping you the link. Okay, here is Excel sheet. The names that I
pasted is over there for you basically for credit collection disputes. So I
have one UAT lead business from business and then I have the users who will
be participating it. And then there are three modules. For AIM we have
three modules and uop. Because this process credit collection disputes is
co mingled meaning 300 users will still log into 900 because this
functionality back then was built on 900. Right. So that's why you see
three different two different system UOPN and AM. Because you want AAM
users to test as well. And we want UOP users to test functionality because
they will be the 300 also will have separate FSCM after day one. So I can
send you this. Jessica.
Vicky3:13
So just to. To be clear, on the one you were just on, Nicholas is the lead.
But Nicholas, Alina and Elena are all going to be testers for the uop. And
then Nicholas Yunus are going to be the two testers for the AM for credit
dispute and collection.
Srinivas3:38
Yes, that's correct. So I've just listed him as a lead because he has
provided his name as a lead and tester too.
Vicky3:46
Okay. Okay, I guess my question is, and I follow you, I just wanted to
validate that. But on the second one where we talk about Honeywell am, you
have two names now, not three. So what I want to make, what I, what I want
to clarify is all of these three names interchangeable for am so they can
be number one, two and three or are they not?
Srinivas4:12
It could be. It could change. Right? This is what they, these are the
users. They think that they need to be participating in the am. Uat.
Vicky4:20
Right. But, but. Okay, let me ask the question different. Sakai wants to
know, let's just take one of them. Honeywell UOP credit. She wants three
names for Honeywell UOP credit alone. Forget about the others because if
somebody's sick, if somebody isn't there, we need to have three names. I
see one name. My question is for Honeywell UOP credit alone, can Elena,
Elena and Nicholas all be testers just for Honeywell UOP credit or not? If
the answer is no, we have to go back and find two more testers with
Nicholas for Honeywell UOP credit only. That's what I'm trying to
understand.
Srinivas5:10
Okay, so to answer your question today from credit team, he's the only one
who is helping us forget about the AIM spin, right? For any project, he's
the one who will be involved from Credit Transformation team that he
involves for testing across the credit scenarios. So he said he himself
will be participating it for doing the credit management testing like we
did request for more names. We didn't receive it. Okay then when you are,
when you talk about what is the scope, right, at the end of the day it's. I
mean I understand the need for three names, but then if the scope is less,
they might propose only one or two names. Right. But we will still go back
and ask or if anyone can help, that would be great too. Rakesh, I see you
have raised your hand.
Rakesh5:59
I think it was along those lines to what Vicky was saying. Right? I know
Suga had said three names. So a couple of points on this. If the
organization is big enough to have three names like Nicholas, if the
existing Honeywell organization is just two people, we may need to get both
the names. If it's got 10 people, then to Vicki's Point we may need to ask
for additional names in case Nicholas is on a vacation, falls sick or
something else. Right. So I think that's the ask is at least a primary,
secondary and a tertiary but where the organization can support it.
Vicky6:33
Right. And tomorrow she's expecting a deliverable that says spreadsheet.
Here's the business lead, Nicholas. Here's the the team that's going to
test Nicholas, Elena, Elena. Here's what they're going to test. Honeywell
UOP credit. Let's go to the next one. And then here are the three people
that are going to test Honeywell UOP dispute and then Honeywell UOP
collections. She's expecting that Jessica and I provide three names for
each one of these or it's not a done deliverable.
Jessica7:09
Yeah but I think the problem on somebody is like particularly credit, there
may not be anybody else in the business and that's unfortunately Becky.
That's the distinction of if there's others in the business that are not
giving us names that's on the business. There may not be others in the
business that know this. And this one I'm looking at because I know like
within our business we have one credit person. Nobody else knows how to do
it.
Vicky7:32
Okay, we need to mark those specially Jessica.
Jessica7:37
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm alive. Question specific to this one for example
is I see where it says Honeywell UOP and Honeywell am. But my question is
is Nicholas a in UOP or in Advanced Materials today?
Srinivas7:54
I think when I we did ask the same question. So yes, we with they will be
with Honeywell. Right. They're not. They're supporting cross funk across
SPGs. So they don't. I mean we don't have a dedicated resources who have
been identified identified as AM users yet for these three processes for
credit collection disputes. So we have asked this question to Paul as well.
Medium receiver, dedicated resource name will be going with Athens for
these three processes.
Rakesh8:22
So I think part of that Jessica is also that the org hasn't been hired
fully in yet.
Jessica8:29
That's where I'm getting at I want to understand better too is if this
person is not in, this person hasn't been hired yet. We also need to note
that because if the testing is being done by uop, the systems may work. But
then there's a risk that the person who actually is going to be sitting in
that steep hitting the buttons for advanced materials may not know how to
do that because they're not doing UAT testing.
Rakesh8:55
They have not been hired, they have not done kt and they're not ready to.
Yeah, it may not be ahead of, you know, uat.
Vicky9:02
Correct.
Rakesh9:03
So we do need to. To your point, I agree that we need to mark that as a
risk and maybe that's by exception. Say, you know, Honeywell can do the
test and sign off for us and get executive sign off, etc. But that's cart
before horse. But I think, yes, at least those step one is probably knowing
the gaps and then step two is decisioning on those gaps. So.
Vicky9:24
Correct. I just think, I just think we have to have answers to those
questions. So when asked, we're all in agreement. This one only had one
person. That's why this one, you know, they're not fully org yet, but the
person who's going to do it is the closest to it until they get the person
or so the risk is the, that it might not be the, you know, 100% because
they may not know everything then, you know, I think it's up to us to be
able to give that feedback. So we're identifying the risk at the same time.
Rakesh9:59
Okay, then how do we. So I think, Srinivas, how do we work with you to show
that here?
Vicky10:11
Can we have notes, can we have a notes next to the remarks where you say
who it is instead of. And I think the remarks are, is it the what or
something? But just add the notes. It says it has a risk, a potential risk
where we can say only one person for credit only.
Jessica10:34
Do we want to add that here or in the tracker?
Vicky10:37
Well, the tracker ultimately. Let me just say that the tracker ultimately.
Yes.
Srinivas10:43
Yeah. So Rakesh, can you update your tracker?
Rakesh10:47
Yes, so give me one second. So on the, on the tracker and let me pull up
the tracker and let's make sure that we've got this here. So what I have is
the tracker here. Now what I was also going to do in this tracker, and I
see people populating it here, is some of these names that are UAT test
resources, primary, secondary. I was going to link them to the sheet that
you had to say, for example, for the erp, for the finance brv, the core
systems as well as the adjacent systems that you're touching. I was going
to link them directly. Add a link here to the Excel you are having because
what you also have is the list of scenarios or areas or work streams, if
you will, and then the, the work streams, the scenarios and where the. What
the scope of those are and links to existing scripts. Correct. So I was
going to link that in here and say, you know, Refer to scenarios, you know,
Workbook X that has, you know, the scenarios and the users and your Excel.
Otherwise I think it may be quite cumbersome to add all the names in here
in every Excel. It may be easier to add a link in here and add another tab
that has your sheets.
Srinivas12:09
Yeah, I've just pinged you the link, Rakesh. Okay then I'm also going to
ping the link for the test scripts that we reviewed together the finance so
that way you have it everything ready for now.
Rakesh12:23
And did you share that link, that view as well?
Srinivas12:27
Not yet. Not here.
Rakesh12:28
Okay, so let's talk through this one then. So next steps on this sheet for
the finance side. If you go back to sharing your sheet for a second.
Srinivas12:40
Yeah, give me a second.
Rakesh12:46
And we'll move, make a copy of these and move them over to the, the Athens
UAT folder as well.
Srinivas12:52
Yeah, go ahead Rakesh.
Rakesh12:54
Yeah, no, I cannot see your screen.
Srinivas12:56
Oh, okay. No, give me a second. Yeah, I'm sharing now.
Rakesh13:01
Okay, so okay so this one is what you had in terms of. So Jessica, Vicky,
this is the other piece on what Sukhai wanted on by work stream. What are
the scenarios or scripts? What are the well essentially number of scripts
and then what are the scenarios getting tested and where are the links to
those? And then additionally the ask on is this fully automated automate,
semi automated, manual what is the process of testing and then where is the
defect tracker going to be? So in what we heard in Srinivas is that on, on
the finance side they are not necessarily going to automate anything there.
Everything will be a manual traditional testing. So what you have here is
test scripts, links to the test scripts that are going to test these
scenarios for ap Kofax or FI or Banking and you're going to manage your
defects manually in an Excel and you're adding the tracker link to how that
definitely defect management will occur.
Vicky14:04
Okay.
Rakesh14:06
Right. So again is that accurate? Okay, so I think the next step then and
we'll get to the ERP section shortly. But questions or comments or thoughts
on this, Jessica? Vicky.
Vicky14:24
The UAT defect tracker, are we consistent on where that, which, which
tracker we're using? I mean we have so many. I just want to make sure that
we all are, that it's all consistent as to where we're going to be tracking
these who are aligned?
Rakesh14:39
I think the challenge would be for ERP portion. Everything is getting
automated and Bill, you'll be speaking to this shortly. Everything is
getting automated in Tosca. So the defect tracking management escalation
Resolution will be in Tosca.
Jessica14:55
So let's. Sorry, finish your thought. I thought you were done.
Rakesh14:59
Yeah, no, no, no, I fairly don't. So go ahead.
Jessica15:03
No, I was gonna say. So can we just put a note next. I know it's a link
which is a note next to the thing in Kafka because that's one of the next.
Rakesh15:10
No, no. So this one is for finance and it's all manual and it's a Excel
tracker. This is. There's a second sheet, I think, Bill, that's work in
progress, will have an update for you this afternoon. We'll share a similar
sheet for erp. So the sub processes or the work streams under ERP and the
remarks around what is the scope of that testing, number of scenarios
there, the similar links.
Vicky15:37
To the test, automated.
Rakesh15:39
And then we will say automated. And then I don't think, Bill, we have a
link to Tosca. We'll just say link. You know, we'll have to reach out to
Tosca team to get reporting.
Vicky15:49
So may I make a suggestion on that link? You could say test case summary.
Can you say finance test case summary. Then we can do ERP test.
Rakesh15:59
Oh, yeah. A second tab. We'll just add a second tab to it. Yes.
Vicky16:02
Yeah, but I just. Yeah, because I see that this says test case summary at
the bottom. And I just want us to make sure, because to Jessica's point,
that's finance.
Srinivas16:13
We haven't clumped this together yet. They're still working on.
Rakesh16:20
So we can even keep it separate. I know it's all integrated, but for the
purposes today, we can say, you know, this is finance test case workbook.
And then we'll have an ERP test case workbook.
Vicky16:30
Exactly. Especially since one's automated and one's not. Now, my question
on the ERP side is it everything is automated in erp. A portion of it is
automated in erp. Can you give me. Do we know what that looks like yet?
Rakesh16:51
Defer to you, Bill?
Bill16:53
Yeah, well, the majority, I would say the overwhelming majority of it is
automated.
Vicky17:02
So how are we going to determine or identify, I guess is a better word, how
are we going to identify those that are automated and those that are manual=
?
Bill17:11
Well, I have the list.
Vicky17:13
Okay, so. So you'll have the, the validator or the UAT testers for that
automated and. Or manual of erp, just like we have for finance, Correct?
Rakesh17:30
Yes.
Vicky17:30
Okay.
Rakesh17:33
That'S work in progress. And we'll, we'll get that. Let's, you know, we'll
get an update on it in the end of day call, I think. I don't know. Bill and
Sri, are you invited to that 3:30 check in? Sorry, 3:30 today or 4:30
sometime today? I think that was an end check in. Right, right, right,
right.
Srinivas17:55
Yes, I am invited to that.
Rakesh17:57
Okay. Okay. So again, Bill, I'm going to forward that invite to you. All
right, so we should get a view of that, at least get a read into it so we
know what the gaps are to prepare for the Sukai conversation tomorrow. So I
think what else did we need? So I think we've answered a couple of
questions there, Jessica and Vicki, on having a matrix of the work stream,
counts of scenarios, the scope of that. These are the test scripts for it
as they are today. Mind you, these test scripts will get refined and
formatted and formalized, but they are as they are you know, today in the
existing test scripts. And then we also have the manual automation view and
you know, where the defect tracking will happen. So I think that answers a
couple of questions. I think the second piece of it was the other Excel of
all the list of testers. I think we saw that for the finance portion and
then we'll get a view of it this afternoon on the. For the ERP portion. And
then we can understand what the gaps are there as well so that we can
comment out from tomorrow. What else? I think those were the three main
ones for tomorrow. There was also the calendaring where we said that we'd
come back in a day or so by end of tomorrow to show the sequencing and
calendaring. So certainly not for tomorrow morning, but certainly for the
following day. We'd need a view of the finalized calendaring.
Vicky19:39
So I hate to play devil's advocate, but I get asked this question
consistently. Why do we not know the calendar and what's causing us to have
to wait another day? We just got to be able to explain it, that's all. As
to why it's taking one more day to get the calendar and why we're not able
to do that simultaneously.
Rakesh20:05
I will defer to. I agree with you. I think it's work in progress. I think
as they identify business availability for each of these, they'll have to
calendar in. But I don't want to speak for you, Bill, or Srinivas. Yours is
a manual process, Srinivas. So you'll have to sequence and calendar these
in the right way. So at least start a view on that.
Srinivas20:30
Can someone repeat the question? I'm sorry.
Rakesh20:34
No worries. So the question was I, I volunteered a date and said we Will
have it for a Thursday morning update to Sukai and the question back was
why can't we have progress on it today, tomorrow and see where report on it
tomorrow. So the question to you back is on the sequencing and calendaring
for for those two week window. Where are we on that and do we have an
initial view on it?
Srinivas21:03
No, I think we are still working on it for the two weeks of window. Right.
How we will focus from finance perspective because like I mentioned some of
the like from Hyperion right. The users will be not available the week of
June 30 to a consolidation reporting out they do Correct. Then I'll have to
go back and work with them when they're available and based on that I can
plan.
Rakesh21:32
Sorry, can we put some a version one of it that has blocks that you can
move around a bit later in a day or two I can do.
Srinivas21:40
It maybe tomorrow or day after because today has been completely squeezed
in to get these scripts and everything ready for you. Right. The Excel
sheet you saw.
Rakesh21:50
Yes.
Srinivas21:50
So that took most of my time. As you've seen I have like close to 19
applications where I need to focus.
Vicky21:58
The reason that I'm asking is is because part of my communication is
dependent upon what you all do because I have to ensure validation. I need
to send a communication out to each of these users saying you know, okay,
welcome to to doing the user acceptance testing or being part of the
process. Here's what you can expect timeline wise and what we're looking to
accomplish. Here's what we need from you. If you run into challenges or
issues, please record them X place last and one of the things that I want
to say that we need from you if you plan to take any vacation time at all,
please let us know ASAP because we gotta validate because everybody's not
going to be gone the whole time. We have people, you know, people in Asia
can work while us people are on vacation. We just don't have the luxury of
not having time. And she's going to ask this question other how many people
are on vacation? Let's identify that know it and what's happening with
comms. But I'm just letting you know I can't do anything with communication
until we get things solidified. We gotta go to these businesses as a
looking like we're a unit of one and not disparate all over the place. So
the thing is.
Srinivas23:20
So what is the due date to send this communication up?
Vicky23:23
Well I should be, I should be sending that comms out right now because
that's what she wanted me to do. But I know that it's taking us today to
get the names of who I'm sending the communication to. So what I would say
is that in the meeting tomorrow is I'm going to send the communication out
tomorrow to these individuals. Because what Jessica is doing now as she's
contacting the leads, we're validating those tester names and getting
tester 1, 2, 3 where needed as well so that we're all on the same page so
that Sakai will have what she's looking for and then we can say yes, we've
done a communication to them, here's what they know, here's the timeline
we've communicated, here's what to expect, etc.
Srinivas24:10
Okay, good enough. So Rakesh, then the window, whatever we have agreed now
we will stick, we will still stick on to it except for HFM and FDS or FDS
and this space. Okay, so hfm.
Rakesh24:23
Oh sorry. So let me make sure I'm following you. So the update that we had,
it's not this but going back to. So the calendar view that we shared and
let me pull that up here for everyone's sorry general info.
Srinivas24:46
So Bill, feel free to jump in. I know this. There is some cross functional
efforts too between erp, non ERP on the UAT window. What will be shown here
and then.
Rakesh25:00
All right, give me one second. For some reason Jessica, I think you had all
the security enabled on that. So I'm even unable to open those files. But
readiness tracking we said today. So this is a slide that is going to be
presented presented an opsep all hands call tomorrow. So I need to work
with you Bill and Srinivas on what are the changes we need to this. So let
me open this and.
Vicky25:34
But as Sakai said, she's seen the slide and is okay with it. She wanted the
next level of detail, correct?
Rakesh25:40
Correct. So this has not been socialized and the broader communication to
the overall program. So we will do that tomorrow. But what you are
suggesting then is exactly that is the double click.
Srinivas25:56
Is.
Rakesh25:56
The double click into this Srinivas is how am I calendaring this 7 11. Now
let's start with the first piece you said HFM and something else will not
be catering to this timeline for.
Srinivas26:12
The 630 to 7 4.
Rakesh26:15
Okay, so what will happen here for HFM? It will be only here.
Srinivas26:21
Yeah. Correct.
Rakesh26:24
Okay, so I think we need a double click. Let me make a comment here. Insert=
.
Srinivas26:32
Because the team will be occupied for all the consolidation reporting.
Right.
Rakesh26:37
Okay. So for consolidation and reporting finance HFM area.
Srinivas26:47
Yep.
Rakesh26:49
Testing starts and this goes back to. To the point that you were making,
Vicki. So in fact, I think what we should do is I'm gonna move this here,
but I would actually start doing a calendar of this a much different way.
So what. Let me just do this. There's not many in here. We can do it in
Excel. I'll move it in PowerPoint here. But.
Jessica27:20
Are you gonna do it based on function?
Rakesh27:22
Yes, I'm thinking by fun, you know, put a block of time and then we will
move by depending on what you're saying. So it's by, you know, your ERP
areas you gave and tell me if that is okay. Right, Bill, does that follow?
Is that how you're also planning to do? Is it by your work streams or you
have end to end? So is that, is that how you've already done that?
Bill27:55
End to end? For the most part, you know, there, there are some mini scripts
that I'm going to be talking to the team about what they, where they see,
you know, those being fit in. You know, a lot of times what we do is we all
gather for the end to end scripts and then they break out. Do you know,
with their function for so many scenarios that maybe the business has
requested.
Rakesh28:17
Okay, again, so I. Let me work with you on it. But I think you get the
picture that, you know, I think this is not, you know, it's. I think you
all are much more deeper into this. But the idea would be to do a calendar
view of function by function across your work streams when the blocks of
timing will be. Has a starting point and then you can refine that on a
calendar view. So at least we should get a view of that tomorrow to say
here's what we're looking at and then continue to iterate it by end of day
tomorrow. I guess that is the ask, Vicky, is by tomorrow you get that in a
much better shape.
Vicky28:57
Well, we definitely have to have that in a better shape. She's going to ask
the details. Her next question is going to be, okay, so let's look at ERP
for seven steps. Who are the testers? And then we need to pull up the link
that says here are the testers for each one of these scripts, who wrote the
script, who validate the script, all that kind of. So she's going to want
to know, you know, that we have that information together. Because with our
time that we're having, her concern is we need to have all these different
parallel activities happening to make sure. That we are not losing value,
valuable time that we can't get back. So you're right. That calendar is
great. If I click on the calendar and it's for ERP X and these are the
users. Here are the three users for each one of the ones that we're going
to work on. Here are the scripts that they're going to run. We're
validating. The content of the scripts is fine. At least we have our
strategy approach.
Rakesh29:59
Okay, so, Audrey, can you work with Bill? Bill on the ERP night? Can we get
that calendar view today for how you're thinking it will?
Bill30:10
No, I don't think so. I don't. I mean, you know, my team is in India, so
it's, you know, midnight there.
Rakesh30:16
Understood.
Bill30:17
I'm not going to wake them up, you know, to get a calendar.
Srinivas30:20
You.
Vicky30:25
Leave instructions for them to do it while we're sleeping. Do they work on
it while we're sleep to have it available in the morning?
Bill30:32
Yeah, I have. I have done that already.
Vicky30:34
Okay.
Srinivas30:35
So in occasion. Vicky, I have a question. Right. It's great that we're
doing. I mean, we are putting a lot of efforts to get these cleaned up and
make sure we kind of position directionally for the uat. But there are a
couple of challenges, though, right, where we need your help. I think I did
highlight this multiple calls, but I never got any help. So let me share
quickly my screen and then I need you help. Give me a second. Just give me
a second. So one is I need to know for the business finance users.
Vicky31:17
I can't see your screen if you're sharing it.
Srinivas31:20
Yeah, give me a moment.
Vicky31:22
Oh, okay. All right. I just wanted to let you know I could if you were.
Rakesh31:46
While Srinivas is sharing. Hey, Mac, on your end, do you have access to the
Athens UAT folder? I believe Jessica gave us access, right? Yes, correct.
Okay, so can you move all these files that we'll get from Shrinivas, Bill
and Audrey into those folders appropriately? Yeah, I'll work with you on
that. So that later this afternoon we can talk reference it there. Yeah, I
don't want to move these live ones, Srinivas that you are working.
Srinivas32:15
Yeah, I can take a copy and send it to you right after this.
Jessica32:19
Okay, thank you.
Rakesh32:19
Well, let's timestamp it and say, you know. Yeah, let's timestamp the
copies we have.
Srinivas32:25
Sure. All right. So for finance, right. Especially in the F5 postings. When
we do postings we need now we have names from entity controllers, right. We
have Two names. One is for India and one is for America. We don't have one
for apac. Right. And for us the contact has been always is Satish Krishna.
He's from Fallen Things team. Now he's struggling to identify a name for
apac. That's number one. Number two we are still looking for Apart from
these entity controllers we need names for business finance. Who needs to
be also be partis should be participating in the uat.
Rakesh33:04
So we don't have specifically the UAT function.
Srinivas33:09
I don't think so. I mean I, I have no issues if the UAT function is conclud
that but I just want a confirmation. If you are okay then I'm okay. I have
no issues then he has been a point of contact. But he's saying that he's
telling us that these are the three or two individuals will be
participating participating in the uat not by himself.
Jessica33:31
So I just want to make sure I understand. I've been looking more at the ERV
validation tracker. How does this correlate back to that? Is this the end
ends? Is that why it's not on the tracker or is this in some shape or form
on the tracker?
Srinivas33:48
It's end to end somewhere. The EFI postings right where the class
functional efforts takes place. It should be somewhere in there. But this
is more specific to non ERP applications I'm referring.
Rakesh34:00
Yeah. So Jessica, the BRV tracker is at an application level so when they
run these processes that are end to end they're going to take people so it
won't nicely match one for every app even though you may have a function
lead for an app. So these testers will likely run several scenarios end to
end. So that's why I'm linking them. But it won't be a one to one match
across the 49 lines there.
Jessica34:26
So really this file or the end to end and the VRE file need to be completed
with UAT testers.
Rakesh34:39
They won't be too different. Those UAT testers, if I'm using an end to end
process tester will touch a couple of systems to do it. So the the point
like you know app number 17 they may touch that and app number 27 they may
touch that to run this process. So they'll be considered testers on both.
So I think we should use this list as the source. That's why my plan was to
link this list against those cells to say across these BRV and BRV
adjacent. These 4950 testers are going to cover this. Okay.
Jessica35:16
I've been linking people back to this BRB validation. So if you have more
time this afternoo, let me work with you to get the names in the right file
because I have a good chunk of names. The second thing I want to call out
and this is why I just want to ask more questions is I have a connect. I
said I have a connect. Vicky and I tomorrow with Will Johnson because I
believe he is the overarching finance owner for uat. Right. Like he's not
the individual one but if there is certain specific ones we're having issue
with finance. Is he our point of contact that we need to escalate to?
Rakesh35:50
He is the overall OPSEP lead and the finance lead. He is delegated or
designated in his areas points of contact. So we should be able to reach
out to those as well. And let me get. Those are the names that you will see
in the in the function league area.
Srinivas36:13
Okay. The next application that I have is tax application which is called
especially for Mexico and Romania. We did reached out to the existing
business leads who actually support or supports the general ongoing tax
projects. Then when we reached out to them to align or you know, define the
test script, they said hey look, I'm not moving with Athens, which means I
am not the user to be involved for testing the ADCAM applications for tax.
So that's when I think did escalate to Paul. Right. And I created a name
for that this application and I need some help there similarly for multi
work1.
Vicky36:59
Go ahead, go ahead Jessica.
Jessica37:01
So I think that's where Vicki and I can help and let's get tactical. So
what I'd like to do if you guys can stay on and I don't know that we
necessarily need the whole crowd for this. Let's go through line by line,
start marking where there's gaps and then Trinivas, Vicki and I or I can
send them out, let's start sending out those connection points. And even if
like that's the type of stuff that we need to escalate immediately of if
the person responds back to say hey, I'm not going with it, I'm not doing
this.
Srinivas37:31
These are things that are going to.
Jessica37:32
Go to Shakai and Shakai's going to go to the right level of leadership to
say either you give me a new person or this person needs a support because
we're not at a point that these people really can say we're not supporting.
So yeah, let's go through this and thank you.
Srinivas37:50
Whenever I've highlighted in red right that's the only areas where I need
help I think rest of the processes, I think functions. I'm good. So I think
I am going to anyway share this Excel file with Mac and Rakesh so they can
summarize this for tomorrow's call.
Jessica38:07
Okay, so, so just, just so I'm.
Vicky38:09
Clear, everything you have marked and read is where we need to get an
escalation point. So let's just go back to the, the Edcom invoicing, the
Tax Act. You don't have a business need.
Srinivas38:26
Yes.
Vicky38:26
You get a UAT business and you need help to identify users. That's where
the escalation point.
Rakesh38:33
Yes.
Vicky38:35
Okay.
Srinivas38:37
Same with Varkiva. For Varkiva at least they've given me lead name called
Chad. He just joined last week or this week. Okay. I don't know the exact
date of the joining but he just joined and he's still kind of getting up to
speed. But then we don't have the names yet. Right. It's great that he's
onboarding, they've onboarded him but we don't have the names yet. Who, who
can probably work with us and the same situation.
Vicky39:03
Do you know.
Rakesh39:11
I think these are, these are all the new hires. Right. So these are the
filling up the org and you know, names and seats. But maybe going through
KT and not quick enough for uat. But I think to the other point this may be
where there's an orange organizational gap where he may not have two
testers to support him on this.
Vicky39:29
Right. And we put a comment there. But my point is, is that if he's a new
hire, he has a boss. The boss knows that we're supposed to be doing this.
So he's a new hire, he may not be able to do it. Who else can assist him?
That's what I need to know.
Jessica39:43
I also we have the pitcher catchers in the KT checklist. So my strong
speculation is up there. Someone new is coming in and the catcher, whoever
that pitcher was, is likely going to be the person that should be
connecting and aiding in uat. And what we should probably do. And this is
where it's, you know, some of it might just be the messaging of, you know,
the messaging to the pitcher of, you know, since you have to do knowledge
transfer with your catcher, sit down with them and do the UAT together. So,
so that's some of the conversations we need to have is some of these
pitchers, because they're likely the person that's supposed to be the one
supporting this are saying that we need to know, escalate.
Rakesh40:27
That may. Very well. Yeah, Jessica, that may end up being very well the
case. I think the program knew that there would be some gaps and that I
think early on there were some conversations that the Honeywell teams may
help with uat. But I think it's the point that where the workstream leads
have to sign off on it. So Will Johnson will have to agree to that and say
yes, we'll help out and we sign off.
Vicky40:51
Agree.
Jessica40:52
Yeah.
Rakesh40:53
But again, we need to the point you're making. We need to highlight those
gaps, escalate it and then get the decision.
Vicky40:59
Yeah.
Rakesh41:02
So I know this is coming up really well for finance. So Audrey, for the 4
o' clock or 3:30. I keep forgetting when it is. Can we get a similar view
or Bill, I should point out, will we be mature enough in terms of a view.
Bill41:21
A view of.
Rakesh41:23
Similar to what Srinivas is sharing of.
Bill41:27
If we can ever get off these. Yes, we could work on it.
Rakesh41:31
I will, I will, I will let. Yes. I don't mean to hold you back.
Bill41:36
No offense, but I mean we want. We know what you want. We want to work on
it, but we need to have the time to work on it.
Jessica41:42
Why don't we do this? Why don't we let Bill and Audrey go and then Rakesh
and Srinivas, whoever makes the most sense to stand up, call with Vicki and
I so we can get the users aligned and we can keep everybody moving forward.
Let's do that.
Srinivas41:55
Sure. Okay. Does that make you mean. The immediate help that I need is to
get some names for the tax application line number 33. Resharing my screen.
Sorry. Then there is application black line and then work here. These are
the three applications where we need names. Again, please keep in mind for
workiva, they've given the name as Chad, but he's brand new to Honeywell,
so. But we need to get him up to speed or we need to reach out to his boss,
find out is he the one who is coming help us with this testing.
Bill42:24
Yeah, we have gaps too. So you know what, what I'm gonna end up putting
together, you know, we have many gaps, so if you guys can help with that as
well, you know, we'll articulate it to you and you.
Vicky42:37
Absolutely.
Jessica42:38
Yeah, absolutely. We're here to be your pit bulls. Sometimes more like a
chihuahua, but we're, we're here to help.
Bill42:44
I appreciate the help because we've been banging our heads against the wall
for a while.
Jessica42:48
Yeah, I, I don't, I don't Want here to make friends. Neither is Becky. So
we're here to figure out how we can get this supported. And if we can't get
anywhere at our level, you know, we'll escalate to Sukai. I can also
escalate to Jeff Hopkins if we need to, but. So let's do that. Let's get
anything else for Bill or Audrey. If not, let's get them off the phone so
they can actually do something. Didn't mean that disrespectfully. I just
meant get you off the phone.
Bill43:11
It was perfectly fine the way you said it.
Jessica43:13
All right, good. And then let's get updates on here because, like, for
example, Chad responded back to names for me. Chad also is not brand new.
Chad is new, but like not day two new, more like six months new that worked
with Chad in the past. So let's just talk through this a little bit because
I also got a bunch of names, but I did it based off the BRB tracker. So I'm
trying to figure out the best way to correlate what I got back to this, see
where those remaining gaps are, and then start working to how we can
escalate. So from this team, who besides myself and Vicki should be on the
call, like stay on the call as we get names on here? Srinivas and Rakesh,
or just Srinivas.
Srinivas43:54
I mean, I'm sorry, what else is needed from my set? I'm all in late for a
call.
Jessica44:02
So what you have highlighted in red is only the support that you need.
Srinivas44:08
Yeah, I need business users who will be from business participating in the
UAT for these applications, stacks applications in Workiva and BlackLink.
That's all.
Jessica44:19
Okay, who's the best person? Because I got a bunch of names, but I got them
based off of.
Srinivas44:24
The systems name for us for. Especially around Workiva and Blackline. We
have been told that Chad and Satish then for tax application, they. They
just gave us a name yesterday. His name is. Let me think of the name here.
But I'm not sure if he's trying to help us. He's. He's from Finance. Yes.
Yes.
Jessica44:49
Okay.
Srinivas44:49
But when I. When I talk. When I. When I started talking to Satish, Satish
said that you should probably reach out to this person who uncalled los.
But he did request a call back and I think my team did schedule a call with
him to understand the expectations. Then after that, we didn't hear back
anything. On the leaves for clarity.
Jessica45:09
This UAT team list is based. Focused more on the end to end Versus the BRB
validation list is focused more on the systems and apps.
Rakesh45:22
Some of these are also. I do see systems in here. So there are for example
Workiva capability you're testing, but you're using the Workiva system. So
we have a line item in our tracker for Workiva Banking for example is a
capability, but I don't. We may use five or six apps or four apps for
banking. So we'll have to map that and say these names and banking all go
against those four apps. Hyperion for example, you got Hyperion HFM and
Hyperion Cash app or Hyperion Planning rather. So I presume this is hfm. So
I shouldn't presume. But we should have to make those correlations to your
point Jessica on some of these tie nicely to the apps. Some of them are a
broader set of apps.
Jessica46:10
Can we make this one file? So make this one the end to end and then that
one the app. That way it's all in one place.
Rakesh46:20
Yes, we can certainly do that.
Srinivas46:21
I'm going to show you this. So Mac is going to do that consultation.
Rakesh46:24
Yes, we will do that and that's why I was wanting to link it and add this
as a second tab to that workbook. And we certainly can.
Jessica46:31
Okay. And I'm going to ask this one more time just for clarity. The one in
the UAT file is the one should be using or the one that got emailed over is
the one that I should be using.
Srinivas46:44
For finance. The one in the UAD file you should be referee.

Not just finance. I, I didn't start looking based on business function. I
just started going down the list like.
Srinivas46:58
Apologies if I'm, if you're referring any different team channels. So I
think that question is found to you believe.
Jessica47:04
Okay, so why don't we do this. Rakesh, can you stick around for like
another 20, 30 minutes real quick?
Rakesh47:10
I will be able to in 7 minutes time so I, so I can join back at seven.
Jessica47:16
Okay, so why don't you do this? Why don't you just call me directly when
you're ready to chat and I can get you and I can get the data organized.
I'll pull Vicky and choose a belt wall.
Rakesh47:25
Yep, sounds good.
Jessica47:26
All right, thanks everyone.

<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Challenge:</strong> Uncertainty abou=
t who should be listed as UAT functional leads and testers for various modu=
les=E2=80=94especially within SAP FSCM and related sub-processes.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Resolution:</strong>  <ul>
<li>An updated list of tester names for FSCM was sourced from business cont=
acts and shared in both the chat and an Excel tracker for clarity.  </li>
<li>For =E2=80=9CHoneywell UOP Credit=E2=80=9D only Nicholas has been ident=

<ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Artifacts Shared:</strong>  <ul>
<li>Excel sheets tracking assignment of UAT leads and testers per stream (C=
redit, Collections, Disputes).</li>
<li>Links provided to both tester assignments and test script repositories.=
</li>
<li>Defect management trackers for both manual (finance-side) and automated=
 (ERP-side) testing were discussed, with a standardized approach still need=

</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Linking and Integration:</strong>  <=

automated), with clear referencing and segmentation.</li>

Okay, here is Excel sheet. The names that I pasted is over there for you ba=
sically for credit collection disputes. So I have one UAT lead business fro=
m business and then I have the users who will be participating it. And then=
 there are three modules. For AIM we have three modules and uop. Because th=
is process credit collection disputes is co mingled meaning 300 users will =
still log into 900 because this functionality back then was built on 900. R=
ight. So that&#39;s why you see three different two different system UOPN a=

 test functionality because they will be the 300 also will have separate FS=

ere are the links to those? And then additionally the ask on is this fully =
automated automate, semi automated, manual what is the process of testing a=

nivas is that on, on the finance side they are not necessarily going to aut=

 matrix of the work stream, counts of scenarios, the scope of that. These a=
re the test scripts for it as they are today. Mind you, these test scripts =
will get refined and formatted and formalized, but they are as they are you=
 know, today in the existing test scripts. And then we also have the manual=
 automation view and you know, where the defect tracking will happen. So I =
think that answers a couple of questions. I think the second piece of it wa=
s the other Excel of all the list of testers. I think we saw that for the f=
inance portion and then we&#39;ll get a view of it this afternoon on the. F=
or the ERP portion. And then we can understand what the gaps are there as w=
ell so that we can comment out from tomorrow. What else? I think those were=
 the three main ones for tomorrow. There was also the calendaring where we =
said that we&#39;d come back in a day or so by end of tomorrow to show the =
sequencing and calendaring. So certainly not for tomorrow morning, but cert=

 the script, who validate the script, all that kind of. So she&#39;s going =
