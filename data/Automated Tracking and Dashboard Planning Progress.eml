Automated Tracking and Dashboard Planning Progress

# Meeting Summary =E2=80=93 June 3, 2025

## Attendees
- Mac
- Justin
- Rakesh
- Additional participants referenced (Sean, Jeff, GDS, supply =
chain/workstream representatives)

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. **Data Flow and Source Systems**

#### **Smartsheet vs. Capital =
Edge**
- Smartsheet serves as the *source of truth* for work plans.
- Work plan data is synced automatically from Smartsheet to Capital Edge.
- App details inventory is initially collected, cleaned, and imported to =
Smartsheet, which then propagates to other systems as needed.

#### **Accuracy & Maintenance of Data**
- Most workstreams maintain =
relatively accurate work plans in Smartsheet, with only a few exceptions =
(=E2=80=9Cone or two outliers=E2=80=9D).
- Particular challenge: DCN and =
Dex maintain their own Smartsheet workspaces, requiring manual processes to=
 aggregate their data.

---

### 2. **PMO Reporting and Tracker Design**

#### **Automation and Integration with Tools**
- Key trackers (heat map, =
master tracker, UAT go-live burn down) pull data automatically from =
Smartsheet, enabling near real-time reporting.
- Current mapping captures =
80=E2=80=9390% of needed data; remaining data targets to be reviewed and =
captured during UAT/MOS (Management Operating System) cadence.

#### **Design Approach**
- Initiated a "design backwards" approach: =
outlined dashboard requirements first, then modeled underlying data =
structures accordingly, keeping future dashboard views in scope.

---

### 3. **BRV Readiness and System Inventory Progress**

#### **BRV Tracker**
- The Operational Excellence (OpSep) team is =
developing the BRV tracker.
- The tracker links individual processes to =
multiple systems (many-to-many relationship), capturing every =
process-system touchpoint as a distinct row with corresponding testing =
milestones.

#### **System Inventory**
- Inventory submitted and imported; =
requires ongoing data cleanup.
- Updated system-inventory views to feed =
into Capital Edge and enable process-level test tracking.
- Tracker to include all combinations: function, sub-function, process, and=
 system.

#### **Testing Accountability and Scope**
- The dashboards will help clarify end-to-end testing requirements and =
ensure all workstreams align on mutual dependencies.
- Distinct SBOs:
  - All UAT activities (full scope)
  - Subset for BRV-relevant =
systems/processes (those impacting 8.1 go-live event specifically).

---

### 4. **Dashboards and Visualization**

#### **Dashboard Requirements**
- Primary dashboard to show status for all systems: number of apps in SIT, =
UAT, completed KT, and other key metrics.
- Requirement for dynamic, visual=
 reporting: e.g. pie charts, histograms, burndown charts.
- Example dashboards from previous projects (e.g., J&J) reviewed as design =
templates.
- Suggestion to display both a high-level visual view and a =
backend sheet for data compilation.
- Visualization to enable =
slicing/filtering (e.g., by BRV scope, function, sub-function, system).

#### **Data Hygiene and Phase Approach**
- Recognized need for parallel =
data hygiene work: cleaning and enriching workstream work plan data as =
dashboards are built.
- Plan to map desired data detail levels and =
communicate with workstreams for data enrichment.
- Immediate focus: build =
dashboard with current data, flag obvious gaps, and progressively clean =
data with workstreams over the next two weeks.

---

### 5. **Licensing & Technology**

#### **Smartsheet Licensing**
- Smartsheet Premium license quote acquired: $1,496/year (intended for team=
 use; to be billed as a technology fee under the SOW/invoicing procedures).
- Action: Add Rakesh to licensing discussion with Sean for processing.

---

### 6. **Next Steps and Coordination**

#### **System View and Process =
Mapping**
- Mac to provide Justin with current data models and sample Excel=
 files as input for Smartsheet build-out.
- Rakesh to share additional =
wireframes and dashboard examples; Justin to mock up dashboard =
visualizations in Smartsheet or Excel.

#### **Calendar Planning**
- Need to create a coordinated calendar for milestone activities (for =
example, UAT, go-live, KT, etc.).
- Rakesh to share past calendar view =
examples.
- Plan to develop a rolling agenda/calendar, starting with =
initial content today for activities beginning tomorrow.

#### **Collaboration and Feedback Loop**
- Justin to review and comment on =
the data model, noting feasibility and flagging any columns or integrations=
 that are impractical or require manual upkeep.
- Plan for follow-up =
alignment later in the afternoon on dashboard prototypes and data model.

---

## Action Items

1. **System Tracker Build**
   - Justin to review and=
 further develop the outline/model, using Mac's shared Excel data, and =
validate against Rakesh=E2=80=99s requirements.
   - Begin Smartsheet =
prototype build with available data; dummy data to be used where necessary.

2. **Dashboard Visualization**
   - Rakesh to send visual dashboard =
examples to Justin and Mac (pie charts, burndowns, at-risk statuses, etc.).
   - Justin to create initial dashboard mockups based on shared =
requirements and examples for stakeholder review.

3. **Data Model =
Refinement**
   - All to review and refine data sources, connections, and =
required detail. Workstreams to be engaged to provide/process additional, =
more granular data as gaps are identified.

4. **Licensing**
   - Rakesh to coordinate with Sean regarding Smartsheet licensing =
procurement and internal allocation as a technology fee.

5. **Calendar Coordination**
   - Rakesh to send calendar view examples; =
Team to agree on calendar layout and start calendaring milestones/meetings.

6. **Reporting Structure**
   - Continue to automate reporting flows where=
 possible; flag columns/processes that are manual for subsequent =
simplification.

---

## Follow-Up Points

- **Dashboard feedback =
session:** To be scheduled later this afternoon for reviewing initial =
dashboard mockups and confirming alignment on the data model and visual =
approach.
- **Ongoing data hygiene:** Parallel effort with workstreams to =
improve data quality and completeness over the next two weeks.
- **Calendar deployment:** Begin adding key activities and planned meetings=
 to shared calendar starting "tomorrow" (June 4, 2025).
- **Licensing finalization:** Expected to be actioned later today or =
tomorrow (June 3=E2=80=934, 2025).

---

## Notable Dates and Figures

- **Today:** June 3, 2025 =E2=80=93 Meeting date.
- **BRV 8.1:** Go-live =
milestone (August 1, 2025), with additional system go-lives planned for =
June, July, and into September=E2=80=93October 2025.
- **Smartsheet Premium license:** $1,496/year (team plan).
- **Applications in scope:** ~200 total, with specific focus on 82 for =
full-scope tracking; subset of ~22=E2=80=9323 associated with BRV 8.1.

---

## Summary

The meeting focused on establishing clear ownership and =
automation for system inventory and BRV readiness trackers, standardizing =
dashboards for systems and processes, planning out next steps for data =
model and dashboard prototyping, progressing data hygiene in parallel, and =
finalizing logistic matters around Smartsheet licensing and calendar =
coordination. Key action items and follow-ups are aimed at accelerating =
reporting readiness while ensuring data quality catches up to evolving =
business requirements and timeline milestones.

It.

0:27
Smartsheet, which direction does it. Which direction does it sync? Like, is=
 the source data for all of the app, like, the work plans? For example, is =
it in smartsheet or is it in Capital Edge?

0:41
So the source data for =
work plans is smartsheet, and then it sinks into Capital Edge.

0:47
Okay.

0:48
And then source data for any app details is the. The inventory which =
syncs into smartsheet.

0:56
Got it. How accurate do you feel like the =
smartsheet data is? Like, are work streams generally good at keeping it up =
to date?

1:08
Yeah, no, the work plans are. I mean, except for, like, one =
or two outliers, they are pretty. It's pretty good data.

1:18
Awesome.

1:20
I guess the one challenge that might happen is DCN and Dex doesn't =
actually host their work plans in our workspace. They host it in their own =
workspace. So it's been historically kind of hard to pull data =
automatically from sheets that they have. It's more of a manual effort.

1:44
That's fine. Does it get pulled. Is it, like, a part of the. Like, the=
 PMO cadence? Does it get pulled into the. Like, there's the heat map, and =
then there's the master tracker, and then the UAT go live, burn down one. =
Does it get pulled into those automatically?

2:05
Yeah, those are all =
automatic.

2:07
So those are the ones that I have tentatively mapped our =
columns to. Just from those two or three, I think that we have 80 or 90% of=
 the data that we need. And the trick is going to be building it in a way =
that provides a foundation for the views that are going to come after this.=
 So what we did is sort of design backwards. So we outlined what we want on=
 this dashboard and what we needed to show and designed a data model =
backwards from it. And there's two or three more views, depending on how we=
 want to cut it. That will come after this. And so what we need to do is =
just build with that in mind.

2:59
Okay, that makes sense. Paperbush.

3:04
Hey. Sorry. Late, guys.

3:05
Hey. So I was just giving Justin the =
background for the systems tracker that we need to build. Justin, one of =
the pieces that I have. Excuse me. Yet to review. Is the BRV readiness =
tracker. But from those three that we discussed, I think that there's a =
very clear path to in Smartsheet pulling 85% of the source data that we =
need, and the rest will mark as review during the UAT MoS cadence with the =
work streams themselves to update.

3:51
Yep. Yep, that makes sense. And =
all of this smart, at least everything that's the source of truth is =
smartsheet, can be linked Pretty easily, automatically. So it should be =
good there by the BRV tracker. Is that the one that the opsep team is =
making on?

4:12
If you recall, there's a system inventory piece we =
submitted, which is what they're doing, which is they've imported that, we =
need to obviously clean that up. And that's part of the system inventory =
that Max talking about. Once we get that updated view, we can go in and =
update the Capital Edge with that new updated view. The second part of that=
 is they're linking that to the BRV process tracker to say this process is =
touching these many systems or it's the many to many. So they're creating a=
 separate tab that says, okay, this process goes to this system to test it.=
 Another process goes to the same system to test it. So they're creating a =
row for each of those touch points, but that's going to follow on to the =
BRV process tracker that they're maintaining.

5:06
Okay, that sounds, that sounds harsh.

5:10
It's a rule for every time it =
touches the same system so that they know that, you know, process X touches=
 system, system A and that's complete, that testing is complete or it's, =
you know, on, you know, date X.

5:26
So I already have a preliminary view =
of it. I can show you. It's the. Let me share my screen. I'll show you that=
 view at least. And this is obviously without access to that process =
tracker. But what Rakesh is talking about is all of the functions for each =
of their sub functions in the actual process that it supports. So down to =
the digital marketing level, labeling applications, this one is something =
in China. Everything that's build back, everything I misspoke. Everything =
that's not TSA is going to probably need to be reviewed for like a UAT =
component. And so that view that Rakesh was talking about with the =
processes are one row per process. So an application might be listed =
multiple times. So it's all of the unique combinations of function, sub =
function, process and system everywhere that it touches so that you can =
roll it up and say for any given system, what are all of the processes that=
 it touches and where do we need to coordinate the UAT testing? So an app =
like an ERP might touch HR and finance. And historically the gap is that =
those teams are very good at executing in their own silos and some of them =
are already working towards UAT testing or engaging in it and some of the =
other folks haven't been aligned to that. And so there's those =
interdependencies that need to be accounted for and that's what this view =
effectively does between these systems. It lets everyone know what needs to=
 be tested so they can align their testing schedules or at least know what =
else needs to be tested outside of just their silo. Right Rakesh?

7:36
Okay.

7:39
And so we're mainly interested in everything that's not TSA. =
Some of the TSA's. Okay, so here's one of the intricacies is that this is =
why I was asking about the data hygiene is there's that BRV column in the =
heat map, the application heat map and sometimes it's marked as no but they=
 have provided UAT and SAT start and end dates. So they marked no for BRV =
impact, no BRV impact and they provided testing dates. And so we need to. =
This is like the alignment that we are going to go drive in the MOS is what=
 testing is required. What's the end to end process? Here it says it's =
legal applications quote to cache and what's the UAT component and what's =
the end to end process? So is there UAT that we need to account for or not?

8:49
This is just like so column J then really isn't just limited to just =
BRV scope, it's really the scope is for all of UAT prior to day one.

9:03
Yes. And that's different from the systems view which is that other tracker=
 that we need to build which is only the BRV scope. The 82 applications.

9:17
No, no, no, no, no. The 82 applications is everything Mac BRV is an =
event that is around 8. 1. It's a start of soft spin. So again there are =
move as is build back applications that are going to go through testing and=
 go live in June and July. There are a subset of applications that will go =
live on August 1st with the BRV. There are a bunch of applications that =
will go live post that Aug. 1, let's say Aug. 5 to Sept. 30 or Oct. 1 as =
part of the build back and move as is all of these are again they're all =
prior to day one. So in this particular case in HSE my read on it is it's =
not related to BRV 81 go live. It needs to go live sometime. And they're =
completing the testing in September and going live I presume sometime in =
September or on day one. So we just have to. So there's a. There's a =
distinction between what is the 22 or 23 systems that are there for an 8.1 =
associated go live versus every other thing going live elsewhere. So the =
UAT is really all the apps that are 82 plus however many there are and then=
 the BRV is a subset of that 82 which is just related to 8.1. Got it.

10:48
And I think really though, there doesn't really need to be any =
duplicative efforts. Right, you can just build this for all of it and then =
just have.

10:59
A filter for brv. Yes.

11:02
Okay, sounds good.

11:04
The only the. Yeah, so, yeah, yeah, let me not say anything more, so.

11:15
Don'T leave us hanging.

11:16
Okay.

11:23
What were you going to =
say, Rakesh?

11:25
I was just thinking out loud on. So the data is there. =
We just need to get it in the right format and start, you know, have it in =
smartsheets and start dashboarding on it. We can then refine how the =
dashboard looks, but at some point, you know, the data is there. We just =
need the same fields and with flags we can, you know, we. To. To Justin's =
point, we can slice to say this is in scope for brv. This is in scope for, =
you know, this is. This is BRV related, this is non brv, but in the same =
time frame and things of that nature. So that we can run through a separate=
 flag. We can create as a column. But the idea would be to put all 200 apps=
 into the Tracker 296 and say, yeah, this 82 is. I think you already have =
it there, but this 82 is this and this. The challenge I have there, Justin,=
 here is some of these dates, the hygiene and the plans are not right. This=
 sit and UAT dates are way off. Or there's also the added piece here where =
it's not necessary. For example, there's a process that's changing, but =
that will touch a system. The system doesn't necessarily need to change. So=
 is that system in scope for brv? Yes, because it is touching a process =
that's changing at BRV. But is there a UAT? So it could be a TS8 system, =
but it's being touched on 8.1 to validate a process. So I'd like to include=
 those sort of things to say, yes, this is in scope for BRV and the kind of=
 testing is nothing from a system perspective, but only from a process =
perspective. So that's the kind of information I'd like to get on the =
dashboard as well. But to do that, the model has to show that that system =
is a. Is a BRV system, if you will.

13:27
I think that that's what I was =
trying to do here. Right. Like for the. These TSA ISC apps.

13:39
Sorry, I took over screen sharing just one Thing. Just a few points, I =
guess. I think the first biggest challenge that we can do internally is. So=
 this is the view that I know you guys are used to, but the back end to =
this is something that I don't want anyone to see because it's an eyesore. =
But it is just a compilation of all the data that I can get from work plans=
 and then I can slice it into a more manageable view. I think setting that =
up is pretty easy and it can be pretty automated from all the work plans. =
Once that view is ready, then there can be one effort to make it back end =
fully compiled data sheet and then an actual report view and then there can=
 be another parallel effort, I think for data hygiene. I do agree that a =
lot of our work plans are definitely more at a high level than what's =
probably needed for this exercise. What we can do is really, I think it =
should come from these work streams. Agree, Good example. Since their work =
plans are actually very.

15:02
Good, we don't have to let that stop us. =
Right. I think that that's the caveat that we have communicated is that we,=
 we will build the dashboards with the data that we have on hand. And the, =
I don't want to say the accuracy, but the accuracy is something that we =
will work with the work streams to enhance as we go through the next two =
weeks in the areas that we have gaps or need to gather more information. =
Right. Or update things like the UAT testing schedule. I know that they =
have them. It might not just be in their plan.

15:41
We just need them to load it into the work plans. And I think especially if=
 they already have it and it's a pretty simple ask, they're all pretty =
comfortable with smartsheet. Now, objectively, this is kind of shit. It's =
very high level. But I'm sure they have more granular data. And I think =
really the only effort there that really needs to be done is kind of map =
out what we want to ask for, what level of detail that we need and then =
really just go and ask for it. And I'm sure they'll have it. And that data =
hygiene can be done in parallel as the reports are being built.

16:27
Can we start building the report and then to everything Mac just said, can =
we start building that dashboard Views of these are the apps in scope. =
These are however, how many are in sit, These are how many in uat, These =
are how many that have completed kt. You know those metrics that you had =
there, Mac, on that page, I think we need a visual view of all of this data=
 and start building it.

16:58
Exactly. That's. I completely agree. And =
that's why one way or another, I think that we can, once we're aligned on =
that, just the model, we can put dummy data in there, which is, I mean, =
I've taken a best effort to populate it with all of the business processes =
and the systems and everything and send that to GDS and ask them to build a=
 model on top of it or build a dashboard.

17:31
On top of it. It won't be =
business. I wouldn't worry about business processes. There's a separate =
tracker for mapping business processes to systems. But I would want system =
sub function, everything else there. So don't. They're two separate things.

17:44
Yes.

17:44
The system inventory stuff that Jeff wants as a first =
pass is we should really get a lay of the land from the work plans or other=
 elsewhere. What are the systems that are in play? Have they got the right =
people for pitches and catches? Have they done KT for those? Have they =
identified all the test scripts? Is it an sit? Have they done, you know, =
uat? When is UAT happening and when is go live? So that view we should put =
on a visual and start displaying. Hygiene can come after that because it =
will show it all over the place. We can say this is what it looks like, =
it's crap. But that's the hygiene portion. The next portion of this is the =
process view of businesses are testing processes. They're touching systems.=
 Some of these systems are getting changed. So they need to align some of =
their testing with. With the windows that it has set up. Other systems are =
not getting changed, but they touch them. So this is the view of business =
process map to the systems. So that's a secondary view that we can create =
either mark sheets or capital Edge. But the first step is this visual of a =
dashboard on where are we with all the systems. And because there are lots =
of systems in SIT today, we need to start displaying what that tracker =
looks like. What that visual looks like.

19:07
Yeah, I think we've got it.

19:09
Okay, so that's what I want to start looking at. And like I said, =
hygiene is step two.

19:18
Agreed.

19:21
And then actually on that note, =
Rakesh, I actually just got a quote for Smartsheet Premium licenses. Okay, =
can I just, can I just add you to this email chain with eye?

19:35
Shawn, Sean.

19:36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, I think it's like 1400 a =
year, which is pretty good. 1496 a year.

19:44
Is it for one person? Is it=
 for a team?

19:46
Is it for 12 people?

19:49
Okay, let's do that. Maybe =
we Put it under technology fee so we can give a code to it and say, yeah, =
this is a technology fee for 12 of us. I think there's a tech fee already =
built in, into our sow or in our invoicing, so internally at least. So yeah=
, send it to Sean and I will action it perhaps later today or tomorrow, but=
. Okay, so I'll let you guys continue the background. Let me get you all =
this data back on the some sample dashboards as well as for the supply =
chain because as a next step I want us to start calendaring things, but I =
need to work with you on just putting it on a calendar. So. Yep, I'm just =
going to go back into the background, guys. So I'll let you all continue.

20:40
Yeah, I'm just taking a look at this one that you just sent me, but I=
 guess this is the system process map. So I think, Justin, what would be =
probably the next step here is to start to build the outline and validate =
it with Rakesh, either in Smartsheet or in Excel. I had stuck it in Excel =
and I can send it to you with the model that Rakesh and I had discussed =
with all of the columns and let you take a look probably and see what we =
have and what we don't and start to build the Smartsheet and then in =
parallel, Rakesh, we can wireframe out the dashboard if you have examples =
for the systems view.

21:40
Yep, sorry, that makes sense to me.

21:43
Okay, so can you help mock up something that shows up as a dashboard? Yeah,=
 yeah, let's start, you know, histogram, pie charts and let me, let me go =
back. I told you, Mac, I will get you an example from some of the projects.=
 Let me look at that right now and get us some examples so we can at least =
start getting a view into what, you know, decent or good looks like for =
this. Give me one second, let me share some examples and give me a second =
here. Just pulling up some samples from the past. So can you all, can you =
both see my screen?

24:44
Yeah.

24:45
Okay, so let me pull this up from =
my J and J example. I probably have a few more, but cut over. So something =
like this would be good where this is for an LE work. But we can do =
something similar. I'm thinking just from a stupid PowerPoint. Okay. When =
this decides to open, but if not, let's go look at this. So I'm thinking =
something like this as a burn down. The expectation is that, you know, if I=
 do it here, so I have a work stream across these systems and I can do a =
poll I forget the regions for now, but I have a view of this was for =
everything across all work stream for the legal close or pre legal close. =
But you can look at it as an execution view to say, you know, this sort of =
a dashboard, there's go live completed, go live in progress, number of apps=
, there's a burn. This is for cutover but you could do the same thing for =
burn down for go live to say some systems are in uat. So this is a view =
that progressively will change. It's a point in time view but it's a =
dynamic one that changes every. As apps move into tsa, as apps move into =
out of Sit, UAT into go lives. So you could have the work stream here and =
you could have go live dates here to say okay, pre brv, BRV and post brv. =
And you could have numbers in here that show the burn down. There are other=
 charts here that. So Mac, I was looking at this for a rolling calendar. =
This is how I'm thinking we should set up this. And so this, this is what =
I'm expecting us to develop in a short while to say okay, let's do this =
over the next couple of weeks but let's over plan. Where do I have. Let me =
see if this is not open. Okay, so that was one example I gave of just what =
a dashboard would look like and other dashboards here would be, you know, =
something like this that shows, you know, this is again completed start at =
risk, behind schedule on track. Da da da. So this will again change but it =
gets a view on, you know, things have started on track, you know, there's =
some behind schedule again from the dates. We could do this for SAT or UAT =
or go lives. This could be a go live tracker. But this is again you could =
have you know, status on this many in SIT, this many in UAT etc. So this is=
 one, this is another view where you know, if you double click a slice into=
 a particular we may not have region but we may want to do sub function. We=
 have a view into this. Similarly I expect PMO to create process views but =
from a system progression view we can double click and if you double click =
into this you will get a view of. Okay, yeah, this many systems here and =
this many systems. So again just examples of how I'm thinking we should =
show execution dashboard and again see if these resonate with you. But =
again this is how I'm thinking we should start hygiene later but at least =
the dashboards we should start showing so that Jeff can react to it and say=
 yeah, this visual looks good. This doesn't tell me everything I need to =
know. Add a few more boxes here, remove this, etc.

28:39
Yep.

28:41
Right. So let me send these slides and paste them here so we kind of get a =
view into. Into how we can. Again, this is not how we absolutely need to do=
 it, but it's a view into. Oh, I thought I pasted everything. It's an =
example of a visual that, you know, types of visuals we should be able to =
show in the dashboarding. Why is this doing one by one? Okay, this is not, =
I'm not liking this. You know what, I'll just send you both all the. Just =
these four slides separately. Screw pasting it here. You guys can get an =
example of the slide, how we're progressing and obviously the data model =
should reflect that.

30:14
Yeah. So Justin, here, I'm going to just drop =
the link into the model that I wrote here. So this is based on the =
conversations that we've had and then also the dashboards that we've talked=
 about.

30:36
Ok, sounds good. I do need to hop over to another call, but =
yeah, I'll definitely review these and then connect with you.

30:44
That's fine.

30:45
If we want to review that sometime later this, this =
afternoon to see what is possible or how you guys are thinking through this=
, it'll be super helpful.

30:53
And that's really what Justin, I'm looking=
 for from you. There's a column in here with like what I speculate to be =
the source table and then the process to update this column. Some of it, =
we're going to collect updates as a part of the operating cadence that we =
have and we're planning on that. And then some of it. I need your, like I =
need you to flag anything that is hard to do or doesn't exist that doesn't =
say manual basically.

31:25
Okay, yeah, I can, I, can I, I see that. Yeah.=
 I'll, I'll put in some comments and then send us a file back. Cool.

31:33
Yeah, that would be awesome. And then once we're aligned on that, I think =
it should be pretty easy to get it loaded. It sounds like you have the =
underlying data all in that back end, so I'm not sure what the timeline =
looks like for that. But in the meantime, Rakesh will take a look at those =
dashboards and then also work on the calendar view IO.

31:55
Yeah, yeah, and let's connect on the calendar view because I'd like =
something. Let me shoot you over again. I'm not looking to over engineer it=
. I just want us to put things on a calendar and start start sending out =
the emails with a. With the agenda. And like I said, we'll develop the =
content for it today, but, you know, starting with tomorrow, so. So let me =
send you that calendar view of what I was looking and, you know, just. Yeah=
, cool.

32:22
Yep.

32:23
All right. Thanks, guys.

32:24
Sounds great.

32:24
Thank you.

32:25
Thanks, Justin. Appreciate it.

the views that are going to come after this. So what we did is sort of =
design backwards. So we outlined what we want on this dashboard and what we=
 needed to show and designed a data model backwards from it. And =
there&#x27;s two or three more views, depending on how we want to cut it. =

giving Justin the background for the systems tracker that we need to build.=
 Justin, one of the pieces that I have. Excuse me. Yet to review. Is the =
BRV readiness tracker. But from those three that we discussed, I think that=
 there&#x27;s a very clear path to in Smartsheet pulling 85% of the source =
data that we need, and the rest will mark as review during the UAT MoS =
cadence with the work streams themselves to update.</div></div><div =

6">Yep. Yep, that makes sense. And all of this smart, at least everything =
that&#x27;s the source of truth is smartsheet, can be linked Pretty easily,=
 automatically. So it should be good there by the BRV tracker. Is that the =
one that the opsep team is making on?</div></div><div =

6">If you recall, there&#x27;s a system inventory piece we submitted, which=
 is what they&#x27;re doing, which is they&#x27;ve imported that, we need =
to obviously clean that up. And that&#x27;s part of the system inventory =
that Max talking about. Once we get that updated view, we can go in and =
update the Capital Edge with that new updated view. The second part of that=
 is they&#x27;re linking that to the BRV process tracker to say this =
process is touching these many systems or it&#x27;s the many to many. So =
they&#x27;re creating a separate tab that says, okay, this process goes to =
this system to test it. Another process goes to the same system to test it.=
 So they&#x27;re creating a row for each of those touch points, but =
that&#x27;s going to follow on to the BRV process tracker that they&#x27;re=
 maintaining.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;back=

6">So I already have a preliminary view of it. I can show you. It&#x27;s =
the. Let me share my screen. I&#x27;ll show you that view at least. And =
this is obviously without access to that process tracker. But what Rakesh =
is talking about is all of the functions for each of their sub functions in=
 the actual process that it supports. So down to the digital marketing =
level, labeling applications, this one is something in China. Everything =
that&#x27;s build back, everything I misspoke. Everything that&#x27;s not =
TSA is going to probably need to be reviewed for like a UAT component. And =
so that view that Rakesh was talking about with the processes are one row =
per process. So an application might be listed multiple times. So it&#x27;s=
 all of the unique combinations of function, sub function, process and =
system everywhere that it touches so that you can roll it up and say for =
any given system, what are all of the processes that it touches and where =
do we need to coordinate the UAT testing? So an app like an ERP might touch=
 HR and finance. And historically the gap is that those teams are very good=
 at executing in their own silos and some of them are already working =
towards UAT testing or engaging in it and some of the other folks =
haven&#x27;t been aligned to that. And so there&#x27;s those =
interdependencies that need to be accounted for and that&#x27;s what this =
view effectively does between these systems. It lets everyone know what =
needs to be tested so they can align their testing schedules or at least =
know what else needs to be tested outside of just their silo. Right Rakesh?=

asking about the data hygiene is there&#x27;s that BRV column in the heat =
map, the application heat map and sometimes it&#x27;s marked as no but they=
 have provided UAT and SAT start and end dates. So they marked no for BRV =
impact, no BRV impact and they provided testing dates. And so we need to. =
This is like the alignment that we are going to go drive in the MOS is what=
 testing is required. What&#x27;s the end to end process? Here it says =
it&#x27;s legal applications quote to cache and what&#x27;s the UAT =

The 82 applications is everything Mac BRV is an event that is around 8. 1. =
It&#x27;s a start of soft spin. So again there are move as is build back =
applications that are going to go through testing and go live in June and =
July. There are a subset of applications that will go live on August 1st =
with the BRV. There are a bunch of applications that will go live post that=
 Aug. 1, let&#x27;s say Aug. 5 to Sept. 30 or Oct. 1 as part of the build =

related to BRV 81 go live. It needs to go live sometime. And they&#x27;re =
completing the testing in September and going live I presume sometime in =
September or on day one. So we just have to. So there&#x27;s a. =
There&#x27;s a distinction between what is the 22 or 23 systems that are =
there for an 8.1 associated go live versus every other thing going live =
elsewhere. So the UAT is really all the apps that are 82 plus however many =
there are and then the BRV is a subset of that 82 which is just related to =
8.1. Got it.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backg=

out loud on. So the data is there. We just need to get it in the right =
format and start, you know, have it in smartsheets and start dashboarding =
on it. We can then refine how the dashboard looks, but at some point, you =
know, the data is there. We just need the same fields and with flags we can=
, you know, we. To. To Justin&#x27;s point, we can slice to say this is in =
scope for brv. This is in scope for, you know, this is. This is BRV related=
, this is non brv, but in the same time frame and things of that nature. So=
 that we can run through a separate flag. We can create as a column. But =
the idea would be to put all 200 apps into the Tracker 296 and say, yeah, =
this 82 is. I think you already have it there, but this 82 is this and this=
. The challenge I have there, Justin, here is some of these dates, the =
hygiene and the plans are not right. This sit and UAT dates are way off. Or=
 there&#x27;s also the added piece here where it&#x27;s not necessary. For =
example, there&#x27;s a process that&#x27;s changing, but that will touch a=
 system. The system doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to change. So is that =
system in scope for brv? Yes, because it is touching a process that&#x27;s =
changing at BRV. But is there a UAT? So it could be a TS8 system, but =
it&#x27;s being touched on 8.1 to validate a process. So I&#x27;d like to =
include those sort of things to say, yes, this is in scope for BRV and the =
kind of testing is nothing from a system perspective, but only from a =
process perspective. So that&#x27;s the kind of information I&#x27;d like =
to get on the dashboard as well. But to do that, the model has to show that=
 that system is a. Is a BRV system, if you will.</div></div><div =

that I don&#x27;t want anyone to see because it&#x27;s an eyesore. But it =
is just a compilation of all the data that I can get from work plans and =
then I can slice it into a more manageable view. I think setting that up is=
 pretty easy and it can be pretty automated from all the work plans. Once =
that view is ready, then there can be one effort to make it back end fully =
compiled data sheet and then an actual report view and then there can be =
another parallel effort, I think for data hygiene. I do agree that a lot of=

should really get a lay of the land from the work plans or other elsewhere.=
 What are the systems that are in play? Have they got the right people for =
pitches and catches? Have they done KT for those? Have they identified all =
the test scripts? Is it an sit? Have they done, you know, uat? When is UAT =
happening and when is go live? So that view we should put on a visual and =
start displaying. Hygiene can come after that because it will show it all =
over the place. We can say this is what it looks like, it&#x27;s crap. But =
that&#x27;s the hygiene portion. The next portion of this is the process =
view of businesses are testing processes. They&#x27;re touching systems. =
Some of these systems are getting changed. So they need to align some of =
their testing with. With the windows that it has set up. Other systems are =
not getting changed, but they touch them. So this is the view of business =
process map to the systems. So that&#x27;s a secondary view that we can =
create either mark sheets or capital Edge. But the first step is this =
visual of a dashboard on where are we with all the systems. And because =
there are lots of systems in SIT today, we need to start displaying what =
that tracker looks like. What that visual looks like.</div></div><div =

you, Mac, I will get you an example from some of the projects. Let me look =
at that right now and get us some examples so we can at least start getting=
 a view into what, you know, decent or good looks like for this. Give me =
one second, let me share some examples and give me a second here. Just =
pulling up some samples from the past. So can you all, can you both see my =

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Okay, so let me pull=
 this up from my J and J example. I probably have a few more, but cut over.=
 So something like this would be good where this is for an LE work. But we =
can do something similar. I&#x27;m thinking just from a stupid PowerPoint. =
Okay. When this decides to open, but if not, let&#x27;s go look at this. So=
 I&#x27;m thinking something like this as a burn down. The expectation is =
that, you know, if I do it here, so I have a work stream across these =
systems and I can do a poll I forget the regions for now, but I have a view=
 of this was for everything across all work stream for the legal close or =
pre legal close. But you can look at it as an execution view to say, you =
know, this sort of a dashboard, there&#x27;s go live completed, go live in =
progress, number of apps, there&#x27;s a burn. This is for cutover but you =
could do the same thing for burn down for go live to say some systems are =
in uat. So this is a view that progressively will change. It&#x27;s a point=
 in time view but it&#x27;s a dynamic one that changes every. As apps move =
into tsa, as apps move into out of Sit, UAT into go lives. So you could =
have the work stream here and you could have go live dates here to say okay=
, pre brv, BRV and post brv. And you could have numbers in here that show =
the burn down. There are other charts here that. So Mac, I was looking at =
this for a rolling calendar. This is how I&#x27;m thinking we should set up=
 this. And so this, this is what I&#x27;m expecting us to develop in a =
short while to say okay, let&#x27;s do this over the next couple of weeks =
but let&#x27;s over plan. Where do I have. Let me see if this is not open. =
Okay, so that was one example I gave of just what a dashboard would look =
like and other dashboards here would be, you know, something like this that=
 shows, you know, this is again completed start at risk, behind schedule on=
 track. Da da da. So this will again change but it gets a view on, you know=
, things have started on track, you know, there&#x27;s some behind schedule=
 again from the dates. We could do this for SAT or UAT or go lives. This =
could be a go live tracker. But this is again you could have you know, =
status on this many in SIT, this many in UAT etc. So this is one, this is =
another view where you know, if you double click a slice into a particular =
we may not have region but we may want to do sub function. We have a view =
into this. Similarly I expect PMO to create process views but from a system=
 progression view we can double click and if you double click into this you=
 will get a view of. Okay, yeah, this many systems here and this many =
systems. So again just examples of how I&#x27;m thinking we should show =
execution dashboard and again see if these resonate with you. But again =
this is how I&#x27;m thinking we should start hygiene later but at least =
the dashboards we should start showing so that Jeff can react to it and say=
 yeah, this visual looks good. This doesn&#x27;t tell me everything I need =
to know. Add a few more boxes here, remove this, etc.</div></div><div =
