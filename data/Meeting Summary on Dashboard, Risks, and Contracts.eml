His dashboard. But let's just =
replicate that view for BMA and start showing it in the calls today with =
call outs. Because I think I want to get it. Like, I want to show that, hey=
, we're using your format. Yes, it sucks, but we're using it. And then just=
 to sort of like. Because Christine responded yesterday by teeing off on =
two. Well, three things now, but two things. Like, one, I didn't agree to =
do the supply chain scope. And secondly was that we were already chasing =
these down. I was like, I don't think you are. So anywho, I think if we can=
 get for the contract stuff specifically, Tim, I think we just use. I =
actually prefer your view of it. But the challenge is that they've trained =
just been his eyes to look at a different chart that's a lot more =
convoluted. So chat with James, but I think we probably need to roll it out=
 in the contracts call today. Yeah, that's kind of the. That's the contract=
 spin. So let me know if that doesn't make sense. But I just think we just =
need to. We need to align with. With what? Yeah, with sort of what she =
wants to show, which is like, it is what it is.

1:31
She's.

1:32
She's sort of paying the bill. Well, Jason is, but that'd be good.

1:38
If we can get that. Yep. The other thing that's come up is given the fact =
that, you know, we raised the concern about reaching out to actuation and =
the conversation from yesterday, we are starting to get delayed on =
identifying super users and the locations of the applications.

2:03
Okay. For which apps do we need to.

2:05
Add a list for the transfer =
applications? I can provide that. But until we can start to.

2:12
Yeah. Okay, so this is where we need to get into details. Right. Because =
we're going to have to show Tori Tory 46 apps missing super user sign off, =
23 missing. Like, you know what I mean? Like, and then we can show her.

2:26
Okay.

2:27
And make it her problem. Like, we can raise it with Tori. =
How do you want to fix this? At the end of the day, this is her function. I=
 just think we just need to make sure that we. We come with a. Here's the =
listing and she'll sort of give us the next steps because whatever she =
tells us, like, whatever she authorizes us to do, we can do. Okay.

2:48
She's not going to be on the engineering call today.

2:51
She's not?

2:52
No. She's in a workshop in Charlotte.

2:56
Okay.

3:02
Yeah, I'll draft that report. I will say, hey, we do have 34 applications =
that we can start, well we can technically start tracking all of them even =
without contracts, let's be honest. Yeah. And so we can just start to push =
and say, okay listen, we're going to start moving forward on these next =
steps. We're going to continue to track the contracts as best we can moving=
 forward, but we need to start talking to actuation because these have not =
started because actuation doesn't know the dispositions like they should =
know the disposition for the transfer contracts because they're provided =
all that information. But as far as moving forward and telling hey, yes, we=
 have super user identified and we can start looking for the location. =
They're going to need actuation people to do that because it's managed by =
the business.

3:47
Yeah, yeah. And so what's are we. Do we have Stevie =
today.

3:56
Or tomorrow? Let me double check. I think we do at. Yes, at 11=
.

4:17
Okay. I would let me get Tori's approval now via ping to just say, =
hey Tori, can we share the engineering. Have you raised this to Tori at all=
 yet? No. All right, let me, let me see. Let me ping Dominic first. So I'm =
going to reach out to Dom and just raise it by him because he's going to be=
 sitting next to Tori.

5:05
Okay.

5:05
I assume in the same workshop. So =
I'm just going to get Dom up to speed so that when we ask Tori she's likely=
 going to say to Dom, Anthony's asking and he's going to say yes, we need =
to share essentially. So let me. Because I bought a. I guess what I'm =
trying to get to is I think we can show Stevie the engineering output and =
say we need help with these applications or whatever it is and then we can =
get into the detailed listing.

5:34
No worries yet.

5:36
Okay. So I think contracts, visual Timbo is one secondly is what you're =
just discussing now just getting ahead of. Is it Europe mostly?

5:50
Yeah, mainly Europe. But there's a few Rockford ones as well. Yeah, there's=
 not. The non engineering teams have been responsive. I'm not concerned too=
, too much about those. HR will move pretty quick. EHS will move pretty =
quick. The ops are running a little bit slow but I'm making as much =
progress as I can on these. I think during our sync with the ops team this =
week we'll just say hey, we need to identify super users for these and just=
. I think that'll work.

6:35
So Tim and Anthony, how like should we create=
 risk around that? Because William is pinging me this morning and asking me=
 hey, these many behind schedules and at risk items are there can you =
please create a risk raid item in capital H for this behind schedule and at=
 risk items.

6:58
So yeah.

7:01
Are all the at risk items related to =
contracts?

7:04
No, the. The one that Tim talked about.

7:06
Right.

7:07
Because we are not able to schedule call with actuation. We are not able to=
 find the. The location as actuation super users. So two one is contract, =
second one is this one.

7:26
Yeah. So I basically said I typed the risk in=
 the chat here. Without permission to reach out to actuation team and =
provide dispositions on applications, we cannot identify super users or =
hosting locations of transferring systems.

7:38
So how many items are in =
this.

7:41
Bucket for the 101 for transfers.

7:49
So guys, didn't we agree last week to push the tasks out?

7:53
We've.

7:54
We've pushed them out, but they're not started. Yeah, that's just a. =
Yeah, these are.

8:03
Getting addressed because the start date is.

8:06
Is in.

8:06
Is in the past.

8:07
Basically. 331 was the start date for =
this particular activity.

8:12
Oh, okay. So when's the due date?

8:14
Due dates back in like much later.

8:18
Oh, just flip them to start it =
then.

8:21
Okay.

8:22
Like.

8:26
Is that like how long is it? So, so =
what's the end date though? What's that risk there?

8:31
What's the exposure in the vehicle? I think possible.

8:35
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So if these just started, like if it's just around =
like starting, not starting, like this is just a cab edge thing and we flip=
 like I guess it's. Are we going past due on anything was more my concern. =
No. No. Okay.

8:59
Okay. All right.

9:01
So that's.

9:02
Except. Except the contracts one.

9:05
Yeah. Yeah, that's. That's cool. =
But I appreciate that it's good that we have the start date so early =
because now we, we can raise this as a, as a small risk, bigger risk and =
then it becomes an issue in the next couple of days. So I, I do appreciate.=
 So I think we can flip it to started amber in there. But I, I do =
appreciate the fact that this is like. I like that it's earlier because now=
 we can actually say we need to quantify this risk. Like so Tim, with the =
risk we just need to quantify like numbers. Right. Numbers scare people and=
 they don't understand it without understanding is this one two or like 200=
. And I think it's closer to 100.

9:54
Yep, it is.

9:55
So I think that's what we're just going to say. Without permission to reach=
 out the acceleration team X amount of homegrown application, whatever it =
is or transfers. Sorry. Will be delayed. But yes, I prefer to start it. =
That'll get us out of the cap edge jail. And then let's work this one today=
 with. Let me ping Tori right now, Tim, because Dom actually is not with =
Tori.

10:23
Okay. Yeah, she's in Charlotte, so I don't know if he's going =
to jump across the plant there.

10:38
Actuation dt. Oh, we got the Andy =
Rag meeting tomorrow as well, don't we?

10:45
Yes.

10:54
Okay, so we just need to so like re pivot a little bit on that view.

11:18
So just to confirm, we are changing all the at risk item and changing the =
status to in progress and at the same time we are creating a low risk in =
the capital edge, correct?

11:31
Not yet. Not yet. I'm trying to because I=
 think if we get, if we get Stevie's attention and Andy Rag's attention, =
this goes away. But I just need approval from Tori to share this with Andy,=
 Ra and Stevie if that makes sense. Like this could be all sorted on our =
call tomorrow where Andy's like, I just need Tory's approval I guess is =
what I'm saying. So hold off for now, Amber.

12:01
Hold on on the risk.

12:02
Right.

12:03
But I will change the status to in progress. Okay.

12:05
Okay.

12:05
Okay. Okay. So once that status flips to end.

12:08
Progress, we're no longer at risk. They capitalize all reality articles. =
That takes care of the risk.

12:20
Okay, I'll do that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. =
Okay. Thanks Amber. So. So that's that one team. So I think that's, that's =
a good call out on. On those ones, I guess. Amber, the one thing and I've =
been doing yesterday's call is when will we have a view of apps due by like=
 when apps are due. Like essentially a burn down of apps, a date of when an=
 app should be completed, handed over to actuation versus when we actually =
have completed it. So like essentially it's an app level forecast to =
actuals.

13:00
You want that view. But started working on that. But here I=
 can start working on that.

13:06
Yeah.

13:07
Basically you want to burn =
down of all the tasks, right? An application level or what?

13:13
No, no, no tasks. I want to just understand when an app is complete. And I =
thought you like, it's. It's essentially like how many apps are supposed to=
 be complete by the end of April like by the 15th of April or any point in =
time.

13:28
Okay.

13:29
Huh. Okay. And so for example, I don't know when =
Fortran is expected to complete, but I would say we're expecting 61 apps =
essentially. It's just there is a task for you that we've got and I think =
you'll get you've got numbers for those, but this is like 4,461. When are =
they all going to be complete?

13:52
You have that ambar. You, you just =
need to make it a little bit more legible because you have the due dates =
for. On an app level, right. You have a percentage complete the due dates. =
So you have that information in your dashboard. The one that we shared with=
. Yeah, this one here. So if you click on D, for example, you have the =
applications all there and their due dates. Okay, Right.

14:21
But when they are actually completed, that.

14:25
That we don't have yet.

14:26
We haven't really done any of those. But this is.

14:28
Think of this. Couldn't this be if like, wouldn't you just add a column =
into here? If you could, then it says if 100% it's complete.

14:40
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can do that. I can do a math step.

14:44
Does that make sense?

14:46
Yeah, you're right.

14:47
Yeah. Because if this is copy. Yeah, yeah.

14:52
This is our plan. And =
let's say if it is 100% complete, then probably populate today's date or =
something like that in the actual due date column.

15:12
Once that flips to 100%, then you got the date. Actual end date.

15:18
Yeah, got it, got it.

15:20
Yeah. So this. Can you scroll down slow? Oh, =
yes. You take your notes. Sorry.

15:31
Okay, we'll do that.

15:34
If you scroll down slowing. Are you going to flip this into a line chart or=
 some kind of. Can you keep scrolling down?

15:47
I have to expand it. But=
, but if you, if you can. This is good.

15:53
Okay. No, this is good. =
Essentially what I was trying to make sure of is that not everything is on =
one day. So I think we're good. Okay. Okay.

16:02
30.

16:02
May. 30 May 30th of May 8th. May. No, no, this is good. This is good. Is =
there anything post end of May? No, no, no, not.

16:11
I don't think so.

16:12
Everything is before finance. The finance application.

16:15
Finance one.

16:16
Yes.

16:17
Oh, Finance.

16:19
This Finance.

16:24
Where is finance? Oh, finance is in finance. So we've got a. We've got a =
dependent task. Yeah. So where is finance actually in our plan? Yeah.

16:40
We added separate task form. So.

16:43
Yeah, I just, I don't know if=
 we rolled them up under Finance or if they're hidden somewhere else. Yeah,=
 they are.

16:48
They are here.

16:52
The thing is.

16:56
These all are interdependency tasks.

16:58
Right.

16:59
So they don't follow with the usual hierarchy.

17:02
Sorry.

17:06
Yeah. So the finance one are don't follow the usual hierarchy. They are =
kind of an interdependency task. That's why you are seeing like this. =
You're able to view.

17:17
Right.

17:17
Like, all these are dependencies.=
 So what I did is I created. So basically I linked their original task ID =
in here as a prefix, then the interdependency word so that if anybody is =
looking at that, they can understand what is it. And then the application =
name and then its disposition. This is how the naming convention I followed=
.

17:40
No, it makes sense. I'm tracking. That's a little bit. Yeah.

17:43
Okay.

17:43
Okay. I assume the June ones are because.

17:54
But I did.

17:55
I would just. I was just making notes on Factory HFM and =
hfm. That one's still spinning a little bit.

18:05
HFM and Factory hfm.

18:08
Okay. Yeah. This second and third ones.

18:11
Second and third.

18:12
Oh, actuation will need access to this post day one because I'll need=
 to close the books.

18:22
Oh, no, this is the earliest this should be.

18:28
Anyway, we can do this for, like, detailed review at a later time. I =
just want to do a sense check of the plans.

18:34
That's.

18:34
That's fine. Okay. Okay. Because if the end of May close will be done on =
Collins books, because the month preceding obviously was part of Collins. =
So the first month in close that Saffron will do for actuation is end of =
June. Okay. Just because it's. It's a lagging activity. Okay.

19:05
Now this looks.

19:05
This looks good. So, Amber, I think what we just =
want to pull out is if you could. We've all got access to this, right?

19:19
I am making changes regularly, so you have an access to a copy of =
this, but I will upload the latest one as well.

19:29
So, Amber, if you could just do us one favor. Right, so on the top, right, =
we got 409. What we do need to have is apps completed is equals 100%. So =
this is obviously right now. Zero. Yeah. Yeah. And then what we need to =
have is like apps expected to be completed. Like, apps forecast. Forecast. =
Is it possible to make this rolling? So it picks it up like it's a formula?=
 Right. I guess what I'm trying to say is essentially I'd love to have, =
like, we've completed five apps against a plan of six apps at any one point=
. So I can tell Jason, hey, Jason, we've completed 20. We should have =
completed 25. And the five that we haven't completed are these for these =
reasons. Right. Just because Jason is all about numbers and stats right now=
. And honestly, when you're in execution mode, he's kind of not wrong. So =
essentially, how many apps, like, have we completed? How many should we =
have completed? And then I guess you could do how many remaining but that's=
 just a deduction of. Yeah, so. Or maybe potentially like apps. Apps =
completing in the next week or so. Like, anyway, like, I think we can sort =
of work on this, but it would just be good to see a very quick forecast =
versus actuals on the right hand side. Okay, Jim, does that make sense?

21:20
Yes.

21:23
And then actually to, to this point, like yesterday we =
had a call with William Seymour and Matthew Clark to replicate all this =
into Capital Edge and they agreed to it. So should I send these =
requirements to them or should I work on this?

21:39
No, I think you, like, you can, we can just, you can like own this as long =
as. As long as like. And I think we just update this. Say like, let's just =
agree on when this gets updated, Amber. Like let's say end of day Monday =
and end of day Thursday every week. Or like let's just agree on whatever we=
 want to update it to once a week or whatever. Yeah. No.

22:08
So refreshing. This is not a big task. It's just a simple export. Maybe a =
two, three minutes job. That's not a problem. But creating this would. Yeah=
, it's very easy. I can do it multiple times in a day. That's not a problem=
. The thing is like this will require some kind of maybe, I don't know, =
expert skills in power bi. So I'm just thinking like how much I can do. =
Maybe I would need more time, I don't know right now. I've never done this =
kind of work like, like rolling and rolling calculations and burn down =
sexual versus focus. So probably that's why I just wanted to have a caveat =
there that probably I might need to do some research or some maybe to watch=
 YouTube videos to implement this. So just, just giving you heads up =
because yeah, this, this will require a lot of calculations and tax queries=
 and all that stuff. Yeah, I can work on that. I'm not saying I will not =
work. I'm just giving. I'm saying that maybe I'll not be able to finish =
this bed tomorrow or maybe might need maybe couple of days or maybe three =
days, four days, I don't know.

23:22
So there's. We've got a power. I'm =
just pinging someone on the New York office who's a power bi wizard and. =
Okay, I'm just seeing if she's got any availability this week. So she like,=
 she like made her name in this stuff as well. So she's got some =
availability this week. I'll. I'll set up time with you and her. Okay. To =
just see if she can say yeah, it's. It's this, it's that. It's like she was=
 actually teaching. She was on a different project here and was actually =
teaching the Collins folks how to use Power Bi. It fell in a heap. But it's=
. She was trying. Yeah. So I guess. So if you said like.

24:06
I guess.

24:07
The, the right hand side is a very much nice to have. Amber, don't =
stress. What we do need to see is that on April 16 or April 12 we should =
have completed like 14 projects. We've only completed seven. I don't need =
that on the right hand side. We just need a view that tells us that.

24:29
Okay, okay, let me do some ticking here and should be. I should be able to =
come up with something by tomorrow. Let me do that.

24:39
Yeah, thanks. Appreciate that. What view do we want to have? I will come =
back to that in a sec. Okay. And so that's that one team. So essentially =
these are kind of like the reporting we have to get under wraps. So yeah, =
that's. That's the key for today is just make sure because the more we can =
keep people at bay and not questioning and challenging, the more we can =
actually focus on actually execution. So Amber, if you could take the lead =
on this one. That's great. Timber. Let me know if like James is pushing =
back in any way. He shouldn't. But yeah, just give us a heads up on that =
one.

25:37
No, I'll reach out to him right after the skull.

25:40
Okay, cool. Thank you. Thank you. And Matthew, you good for the Rockford =
calls today? Okay. Do we have agendas and whatnot ready for them?

25:51
Yeah, we do part put this together before she left and I was on the calls =
last week so it should be relatively straightforward. I think that we have =
Colin Gillis today, this afternoon if. Let me check if that's still on the =
calendar actually. Or it might have been combined with tomorrow. But =
basically what we're looking from Colin is to see how much progress he's =
made in that file answering yes or no for the DT01 apps. He's had five days=
 to do it, so gonna try and put his feet to the fire a little bit. And the =
other one, did we follow.

26:30
Up with him last week on it?

26:32
Yeah.

26:34
Okay. And what did he. He just didn't respond?

26:37
No.

26:37
When did we follow up? Because I need to make sure that.

26:40
He left me on red on Friday.

26:43
Do we do it via email?

26:45
No, I did not.

26:48
See. If you're gonna follow up with this kind of =
stuff, it has to be via email, Mac, because it's. It's not traceable. Okay,=
 so just follow up. Say, hey, like, Tory's on. Like, got people on the =
email. Like, if Ping doesn't. Like, Ping only works if you want a really =
quick answer. If you need to follow up with someone to get them moving, it =
has to be via email where other people are on the chain.

27:13
Okay, so can I send him a quick note this morning? Say, hey, like, looking =
forward to our call this afternoon. Planning to review the progress that =
you've made on the file that we sent last week. Let me know if you have any=
 questions in advance.

27:27
Yeah, we can.

27:28
I think it's.

27:29
If he hasn't done it, it might be late to get progress, but it's not a =
whole.

27:33
I mean, any progress is good just getting him to look at it. =
Okay, and the other is Josh Lee's.

27:44
Okay, so do we have the tester =
identified for, like, what do we need to do for Fortran?

27:54
So some of the testers have come back and said that they are into.

27:58
The schedule and various of them are in and out of office. John is =
coordinating. So I'm just looking for an update from him on calls that he =
has.

28:06
Scheduled and what gaps are we're meeting.

28:10
It sounds like everyone is open to being the testers. It's just two people.

28:16
We're on vacation and I haven't seen.

28:20
Any of the actual invites go out, but once, I guess I can test. Okay, so =
the test has been confirmed? Yes, correct. After this call today. Okay. And=
 so we haven't scheduled the testing yet. We haven't scheduled the testing =
yet, but.

28:44
They have provided, like, I'll be free on this block. And =
I need to remind Josh, hey, can you schedule these? These folks are =
supposed to be back this week.

28:56
Okay. And do they have. Do they all =
have the compiler? Yes. Well, that was the thing is they.

29:02
There was like one guy who said, I don't have the compiler, but the guy who=
 does is on vacation, but he'll do it. But we have points of contact with =
the compilers who are able to test with availability. So we have the names =
identified we need to do the sessions.

29:20
Okay, and who's setting up =
the session?

29:23
Should we set it up or should Josh.

29:31
What's being agreed with Josh?

29:33
I don't think that we have agreed =
with Josh. We provided the template to Josh for. Hey, here he's having you =
go request testers. We could provide a template for the email and ask him =
to set it up. I think that just because he's close with these people, it =
looks good coming with him. And then we can help facilitate. So we'll send =
him an email template, he'll give us the dates that everyone has come back =
with and we'll prepare a slide or two for him to run.

30:06
Well, yeah, let's not overcook it though. Right. So essentially, what needs=
 to be done for us to test? I would just. Let's focus on the prereqs. Right=
. Like, we need. Like, is the landing zone needed before we test?

30:20
I don't think so, because it's locally compiled on the computer.

30:25
The Fortran scripts. So the compiler is. I agree, but the scripts don't sit=
 on the computer. The scripts sit in like a controlled place owned by a =
lady that I can't remember her name.

30:37
Okay, so that's one of the open=
 questions then. Do we need a landing zone or can we test locally?

30:42
So I need you to run through what do we need to actually make testing? Or =
like, is this testing or is it validation? I guess that's one question. And=
 then what do we need to do to make sure we can get this validation done =
successfully? If it needs to be in its final location, then we need a =
landing zone, which means we're delayed because of no landing zone.

31:05
Okay.

31:06
You know what I mean? Yeah. Or if it's going to be in a team =
site that's dedicated to actuation, that might be good enough. Like, who's =
doing the final sign off? Like, we need to just jot these things down and =
similar to the page you've already put together. But like, we just need to.=
 What we can't have is bring three people from actuation in and then =
realize, wait, we're missing something. False alarm. We'll come back next =
week. We're trying to avoid that.

31:30
Okay.

31:31
And I guess how long does it take to test every script? And are we testing =
every script?

31:37
I will add those to the open questions.

31:39
We need to work through exactly. With. With Josh. Like, what's the approach=
? Right. And so have a crack at that Mac. Let's. We need that before Josh's=
 call today.

31:53
Yeah, we have something similar. Yeah, we have pretty =
much it. It's in the same deck. I'm just going to pull it up and I'll send =
you the link. It's in the same Rockford app approach.

32:07
But does it have the details right of, like, how many are we testing?

32:15
It does.

32:16
I'm looking. Hold on. Fortran, we're testing. There's=
 20 copy and 2 logical separation and 61 fortran.

32:34
We're just talking about Fortran today, aren't we? Like Well, I guess. What=
 are we talking about today?

32:40
So we're talking about the upcoming =
Capital Edge tasks that he has due, talking about the Fortran testing and =
the other apps under his purview, Capital Edge. So Fortran testing, Capital=
 Edge tasks coming due.

33:02
Okay. And so when are the other ones due? At=
 the same time as Fortran or are they like, a later date?

33:09
They're a later date.

33:11
So let's go all in on Fortran. Let's clear 61 =
off the list so that when Anvar creates the chart, we've got momentum at =
least in one site. You know what I mean? Let's. Let's get fortunate over =
the line and let's have some very tactical questions for Josh, who's =
setting up the meeting, when should we have it? Like, do we need to =
identify landing zones? Like various tactical questions that we can align =
to and close out on the call. Because as soon as this guy comes back, if =
he's got the compiler already and we're going. Does that make sense?

33:55
Yeah, that makes sense. Sorry, I'm just taking notes.

33:59
Okay. Yeah. So. And then once you've got that page of like the tactical =
items, just ping me the link and I'll just jump in and add anything that I =
can think of. Ideally we meet Josh once a week. Ideally this session next =
week is the testing session.

34:20
Perfect.

34:22
If we can get ourselves in order, that'd be ideal. I'd prefer Friday just =
so that it pops up. But yeah, let's. Let's work through it.

34:34
Okay.

34:34
Can't speak to dates until we look at the prereqs. Yeah. All right, =
so that's that one. What else do we have for Rockford today? Is it just =
those two? Yep. Okay. Okay. All right.

35:00
And Anthony, I do have couple=
 of items for Bangalore. So the first one is Friday. On Friday when I sent =
out an email, maybe I can show you to you. And I really wanted your sort of=
 team's help on. On replying to that because tomorrow I have a call with =
Vinay. So actually we initiated this conversation with Vinay last week. =
Like for this four transfer application, we want to understand what are the=
 local contracts so that we can initiate the contracts conversation. And =
then I sent out an email to him and then he replied me with this. That for =
isograph, he need more information on this. These are the SCM DT =
procurement contacts. So not sure should I reach out to them how. How this =
should be tackled? So for timing designer, he's saying this is not hosted =
in the GITC IND site. So not sure what. What he Meant for. For all this. =
These are. These all are contracts related and the task that we are talking=
 about is obtain local contracts and the PO information.

36:22
Okay. So that Robert Hock reports into Christine Balsam and so does Laurie.=
 So in non product. So Tim, we might need to add Isograph and Micro Semi =
Designer to our discussion this afternoon.

36:56
In the contracts =
Discussion?

36:58
Yeah, yeah I'm a designer.

37:05
I have a contract for. I think I want to say France but I'll have to double=
 check.

37:14
Yeah, there a couple of applications are not hosted in =
Bangalore. I checked the master and they were having Polverhampton and =
Panberry as their I would say primary site or something like that in the =
description if I go there. Yeah I did check that.

37:41
There is one distinct one side of Bangalore. Let me just make sure I got =
that one right.

38:06
I was looking.

38:10
Yeah, I can track those ones =
that I have that are dedicated and I'm already looking for those contracts =
because they're. They're not just purely Bangalore. The only one that I =
have is purely Bangalore is Quick Silver. So I'm looking for these already.

38:26
So should I ping you this so that during your day Tim, if you are =
able to get the answers? Because I have a call with Vinay tomorrow at this =
time only so I have to.

38:41
Okay.

38:45
And here we are talking only =
about timing designer and Optress and then this two will be tackled during =
your call.

38:55
One second, I'm just pulling them up.

38:56
Okay. Okay real quick. Sure.

39:01
I've got the whole list so I can tell =
you which ones I actually have contracts for and which ones I don't.

39:07
Okay.

39:26
And then on the side note Anthony for the homegrown ones. So =
Pradeep who is. Who is from Copious team he was asking me whether we have =
initiated the conversation for testing waivers so I said like first we will=
 have a discussion with Tori and the leadership team and then we are going =
to socialize the slides with the. With the actuation team.

39:51
So sorry, which slides are your number. Sorry.

39:53
Testing. Testing waiver.

39:55
The 12 application.

39:57
So have we started that like socializing with Tori? Yeah, yeah.

40:04
No, no we. We're not going to have Tori today unfortunately.

40:08
Okay.

40:09
So I need not need to be delayed. I think Tim, what we may need to do=
 man is package up a like a. An email for Tori because we've got a bit =
pending her now. Yeah, and we'll get that out end of day. One of them is =
the testing waiver and they would accept.

40:29
Yeah.

40:30
And the other item was on the finalize actuation. Sorry the. The location =
for which we have to talk to TTSMO to finalize the landing zone basically =
for all this, all the sites, starting with Bangalore.

40:54
Yeah. So I can raise this with Jason this afternoon. Yesterday afternoon's =
call was a prep call for something else.

41:01
Okay.

41:01
Okay. But I can raise this this afternoon. We had a call on Friday =
internally just to make sure that we weren't gonna shoot anyone else or =
throw away, I guess there anyone else under the bus from the EY team. And =
that was a no. So I'll raise the risk tonight. Amber, is that like landing =
zone is required for. Right. 100 plus applications across Bangalore or all =
sites, really? Well, not all sites. Bangalore and Rockford specifically. =
Right. I think, yeah.

41:31
Yes, they have the IES randoms.

41:37
So should I send you a note, Anthony, on this or we are good?

41:42
I think we're good on this. Okay. I think. Yeah, we're working through this=
 through a different channel. I think the. I think we're good. I think what=
 we can do tomorrow is we've gone away from it, but I think, team, what we =
can do is. Is get back to the tactical items list starting tomorrow just so=
 that we're. We're very clear on what we're working on. Because there's =
always going to be more work than there is time. So let's just spend time =
sort of working through what's the priority for that day. Because the =
priorities shift depending on who's asking for it. And I'm going to need =
your help to update or refresh the numbers on the chart that we pulled =
together yesterday. And we just need to tighten up some of the language on =
the functional side. Okay. As well. The other thing, Mac, I just need your =
help with is can you please create speaker notes for Despina? Because she's=
 presenting and I'm legit scared that she's going to say something wrong =
and we're going to end up with a huge fire drill or an action list.

42:54
Speaker notes for Despina for which.

42:57
Just overall the deck. Yeah, =
for each page.

43:00
For each page of which deck?

43:03
The SMO Day one readiness deck.

43:06
Okay.

43:07
So essentially for each page, we just need to tell Despina what we want her=
 to say. She doesn't need to read it, but we can't do anything more. Right.=
 So I would sort of give her six key bullets for the page and let her. Let =
her wander off and go elsewhere. But I think we. We need to give her that =
view.

43:33
Okay. Yeah, I can do that.

43:38
Cool. There's a review at I =
think 11. Let me just check. There is a review with Despina At I'm off my =
calendar. But it's. It's definitely. I think it's around noon. So I think =
if. As long as we can sort of have something ready by noonish, then just =
let me, let me know. I think the way to play it is just to put a text box =
in the right hand side of the page and just put like the spina talk track =
or something like that and have a crack at it. And then we'll ping you and =
you've got like a good draw for each of them and then we'll go through them=
 and find it. Okay.

44:37
Any key call outs that you have off the top of =
your head or like, what's the main story that you think?

44:45
I want you to have a crack at that. Right. So that's sort of when you sort =
of review it. Like if you were good, like presenting to an executive =
audience and you want to tell people what they need to know, but also get =
off stage as quickly as possible. How would you do it? There's going to be =
edits to it, Matt, so don't worry about getting it wrong. I want you to =
have a crack at it and then we'll refine it together. Sure. Yeah, yeah. =
Just let me know when you've got a good draft of it and then we'll jump =
through it and then we'll work through it.

45:13
Okay, sounds great.

45:15
Okay, cool. All righty, team. I don't worry about apologies. Team's =
probably shaking his head.

45:20
I apologize.

45:23
You guys are still talking.

45:25
I have to. I have to take the dog out =
really quickly, but I'll be back inside in like 15 minutes.

45:32
Yeah, no worries.

45:33
Okay.

45:33
How's your house, Tim?

45:36
House is fine.

45:37
Surviving.

45:39
No, no trees on the house. So we're=

could just do us one favor. Right, so on the top, right, we got 409. What =
we do need to have is apps completed is equals 100%. So this is obviously =
right now. Zero. Yeah. Yeah. And then what we need to have is like apps =
expected to be completed. Like, apps forecast. Forecast. Is it possible to =
make this rolling? So it picks it up like it&#x27;s a formula? Right. I =
guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is essentially I&#x27;d love to have, =
like, we&#x27;ve completed five apps against a plan of six apps at any one =
point. So I can tell Jason, hey, Jason, we&#x27;ve completed 20. We should =
have completed 25. And the five that we haven&#x27;t completed are these =
for these reasons. Right. Just because Jason is all about numbers and stats=
 right now. And honestly, when you&#x27;re in execution mode, he&#x27;s =
kind of not wrong. So essentially, how many apps, like, have we completed? =
How many should we have completed? And then I guess you could do how many =
remaining but that&#x27;s just a deduction of. Yeah, so. Or maybe =
potentially like apps. Apps completing in the next week or so. Like, anyway=

 call. Because as soon as this guy comes back, if he&#x27;s got the =
compiler already and we&#x27;re going. Does that make sense?=
