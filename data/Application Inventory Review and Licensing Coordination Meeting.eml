Application Inventory Review and Licensing Coordination Meeting

# Meeting Summary

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Application Inventory =
Review
- **Applications Considered**: Mentor Graphics, Global Component =
Database (GCD), and GERB Tool.
- **Current Status**: These applications =
were not previously in the inventory. They emerged from work on the Hornet =
project and subsequent potential additions analysis.
- **Ownership Clarification**:=20
  - **Global Component Database**: =
Associated with Mentor Graphics, now part of Siemens EDA after acquisition.
  - **GERB Tool**: An independent engineering tool requiring local =
installation and licensing.

### 2. GERB Tool Licensing and Usage
- **Installation and Licensing**: GERB Tool requires a local installation =
with licenses that need to be purchased by the engineering group.
- **Current Licensing Status**:=20
  - Unknown if licenses are already =
acquired.
  - Need to determine the number of active users.
- **Action Plan**:=20
  - Follow up with Colin Gillis on GERB Tool =
licensing and active users.
  - Verify if licenses are accounted for in the=
 TSA EN01 costing.

### 3. Mentor Graphics and Global Component Database =
(GCD)
- **Vendor Information**: Mentor Graphics, now Siemens EDA, offers a =
suite of tools.
- **Application Tracking**:=20
  - Siemens tools like =
Siemens NX are already tracked.
  - GCD referred internally as "Edmund."
- **Replacement Strategy**:=20
  - Creating a standalone database with an =
Excel file for parameters, similar to the Hornet project.
  - Tim Mullen is responsible for developing the standalone library.
- **Impact on Inventory**:=20
  - No need to track GCD separately as it =
will be replaced by the standalone library before Day One.

### 4. Divestiture Process (Day One and Day Two)
- **Key Dates**:
  - **Day One**: May 31st =E2=80=93 Logical separation begins.
  - **Day Two**: Physical separation follows after Day One.
- **Separation Phases**:
  - **Day One**: Users redirect to the standalone =
library, ensuring logical separation from the global master library.
  - **Day Two**: Users must perform local installations and obtain =
individual licenses, ensuring complete physical separation.
- **Licensing Management**:
  - Licensing costs managed via a "bucket" in =
TSA costing, reflecting the total cost of provided applications.
  - Ensuring Collins accounts for these licensing costs accurately.

### 5. Coordination with Contracts and Licensing Teams
- **Consent Agreements**:
  - Need for consent agreements with Siemens EDA =
and WYSE Software.
  - Tim Patrick is liaising with the contracts team to =
facilitate these agreements.
- **Licensing Verification**:
  - Confirm that all licenses under TSA are appropriately accounted for.
  - Avoid unauthorized reseller issues by ensuring divested users remain =
employees or authorized contractors.
- **User Count Verification**:
  - Determine the number of active users across locations: Bangalore, =
Wolverhampton, and Rockford.
  - Collaborate with the licensing team to =
obtain accurate user counts.

## Action Items

- **Christine**:
  - Collaborate with Tim and Anthony to extract actuation user accounts for=
 Mentor Graphics and GERB Tool.
  - Follow up with Colin Gillis regarding =
GERB Tool licensing and active users.
  - Request a report from the =
licensing team on Mentor Graphics and GERB Tool user counts.
  - Reach out to the licensing team for user counts and share the latest =
census data.
 =20
- **Matt**:
  - Send an email to the contracts team =
regarding consent agreements for Siemens EDA and WYSE Software.
  - CC relevant teams to ensure all stakeholders are informed.
  - Coordinate with Tim on user counts and necessary licensing information.
  - Ensure the contracts team is aware of and addresses consent needs for =
Siemens EDA and WYSE Software.
 =20
- **Tim**:
  - Continue developing the =
standalone library to replace GCD.
  - Work with Christine and Anthony to =
provide user counts and licensing information.
 =20
- **Anthony and Pari**:
  - Assist in validating the application inventory and provide specific =
details as needed.

## Follow-up Points

- **Verification of Licensing =
Costs**:
  - Ensure all licenses provided under TSA are accurately =
reflected in the costing efforts.
 =20
- **Consent Agreements**:
  - Finalize consent agreements with Siemens EDA and WYSE Software through =
the contracts team.
 =20
- **User Count and Licensing Details**:
  - Obtain and verify the number of active users for Mentor Graphics and =
GERB Tool across all locations.
  - Provide this information to the =
contracts and licensing teams for accurate cost allocation.
 =20
- **Census Data Sharing**:
  - Share the latest census data with Christine =
to assist in determining active user counts.
 =20
- **Vendor Inquiries**:
  - Redirect any vendor inquiries regarding licensing and technical issues =
to the contracts team to avoid unauthorized reseller concerns.

## Key Dates and Figures

- **Day One**: May 31st =E2=80=93 Logical =
separation commences.
- **Divestiture Sites**:=20
  - Bangalore
  - Wolverhampton
  - Rockford
- **Licensing Locations**:
  - Users in Bangalore, Wolverhampton, and Rockford require licensing =
verification.
- **Current Timeline**:
  - 52 days until May 31st, as =
highlighted in the weekly leadership call.

Transcript:

It, it's. It, it's.

2:06
Hey, Christine, can you hear me?

2:08
Hey. Hey, Christine. Hey, Christine. Yeah, it's a little muffled, but I =
can't hear you.

2:17
That looks better.

2:17
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

2:21
All right. Are we waiting for anybody else or is this just me for this=
 one?

2:25
I think it will be just you originally. So I got your name from=
 Pari Sankoya and Anthony Lockley, colleagues here. We're working on the =
Business Managed Apps team. I'm not sure if you have worked with them, but =
I think that it is our first time meeting and let me just double check and =
see. I'm not sure if Tim is able to join, but Tim Mullen I think was the =
other person.

2:55
Yeah, his counterpart of mine. I will see if he's =
available.

2:59
Yeah. This should not take very long. Really. There were =
just a couple apps that came up as potential additions to our Business =
Managed app scope that we had flagged that we wanted to review with you and=
 Tim. Okay, let me get the list. There we go.

3:22
Yeah, I just pinged Tim, so hopefully but I can cover most of it that he =
should be coming along to.

3:29
Cool. So the three were Mentor Graphics, =
the Global Component Database and GERB Tool. So right now these were not in=
 our inventory and they came up, I think from the work that we did on =
Hornet and then also just in our analysis of potential additions and we =
were trying to understand. I know that Pari had talked to Tim previously =
about the library that's being built at and I'm not sure if Mentor Graphics=
 and gerbtool are related to that or if it's just the Global Component =
Database, but just trying to understand who's the owner. Is it related to =
that library? And ultimately do we need to pull this into the inventory of =
apps that we're tracking or not?

4:18
Yeah, and I mean we've been working =
on this with the Redwood crew since last year, so I'm not sure why they're =
coming back around again on these. Yeah, yeah, the, the listings there. =
Grip tool is its own independent engineering tool. It does not store data =
that if, if that's needed by that group, that's just a straight up local =
install and they're going to have to purchase licensing. So there's nothing=
 that I would say we need to migrate. There's no configuration. So that's a=
 pretty simple one.

4:59
Lovely. Do we have licenses already for that? Are=
 there actuation users of GerBTool? I wonder.

5:09
That one wasn't on my radar, but maybe because it wasn't something where we=
 had migration activities around it that it might not have been on my radar=
.

5:17
Yeah, I can tell you we would.

5:20
Have to ask the engineering =
group.

5:22
Okay. Yeah, I can follow up with Colin Gillis too who's =
working on the EN. The TSA EN01 costing and try and understand if GERB tool=
, those licenses that are. If they're centrally provided are accounted for =
there and if there are actuation users. Okay, so I might follow up with.

5:52
Yeah, I mean Colin's been involved with some of these questions since =
last year. My original point of contact was Locksme and I think her. A lot =
of her activities have been transferred to Colin since she left.

6:07
Yeah, yeah, that's my understanding as well. Hey, Jesse.

6:13
So the two are, you know, we've been working on since last year now. It's. =
It's a little misleading the way they're listed. The global component =
database is the electrical library, so that's one and the same. It actually=
 is from Mentographics was the vendor. It's now Siemens. Siemens bought out=
 Mentographics. So you'll see those used somewhat interchangeably. Menor =
graphics being its own listing. That's a vendor name. And depending on who =
you talk to, it's going to mean different applications because they have a =
pretty massive suite of tools. So I don't know in that particular case =
necessarily what group of tools they are referring to.

7:04
Yeah. And I can go back and look at the application inventory, but I think =
that that makes sense. I did hear that this morning that it was acquired by=
 Siemens. And if it's an app, and if it's not an app, it's a suite of tools=
, then I don't think we need to track it outside of what we're already =
tracking because we have those Siemens tools like Siemens nx, we have all =
of those Siemens tools already accounted for. And so if this to you is not =
like a one particular application that we're using, there's no need to add =
it.

7:39
Yeah, this might be a little bit different than some of the other=
 Siemens tools. I mean demographics is now Siemens eda, so it is part of =
Siemens, but I know it. It generally ends up in its own bucket when we're =
talking about tool divestitures or migrations. So I suspect this refers to =
the client applications which, you know, we have various methods that those=
 get deployed out. But again for client applications, the expectation with =
the divestiture is they're going to have to do local installs and obtain =
their own licensing prior to physical separation. That for the time being =
they're still relying on our Software deployments for clients. And they're =
still tapping into Collins licensing and that would continue during logical=
 separation, but prior to physical they'd have to have local installs so =
that they're no longer dependent on our deployment methods.

8:49
So day one.

8:50
Yeah, whatever deployment method Saffron wants. Right. At=
 that point before physical separation, they need to have their own =
installs.

9:00
Okay. And physical separation is like day two. Right. So =
we're going to be logically separated for day one and then day two, the =
physical separation. Yeah, they will obviously have to go there. Like =
that's their own strategy.

9:12
Right.

9:13
Okay.

9:15
So that's between day one and day two. My understanding is that it's on =
them to figure out, you know, tool deployment or local installations and =
then I don't know who they're working with on, you know, figuring out =
licensing. I think there were some questions around that of we may need to =
at least provide what we believe they're going to have to go purchase for =
licensing.

9:37
Okay. So I just checked my notes and I had a piece in =
there that potentially this Mentor Graphics was referring to the VX tool 2.=
6. So that would be the.

9:50
Those would be the client that go hand in =
hand with that Global Component Database library. So yeah, that. And =
they're going to get bumped up in a version when we bump up, we're going to=
 carry them along with us. But those would be the client applications.

10:06
So this is the client applications for gcd.

10:10
Yes, got it.

10:12
Okay. And so with the library that's being built, will that replace =
gcd?

10:22
Yeah, for them, yes. And we went back and forth a lot last year=
, beginning of this year originally, I think the Laksme and the Redwood =
team had signed up for a clone and cleanse of the existing system. But it's=
 a server based system, it's got an Oracle database and it was way more =
than what they need and way costlier than what anybody in the end wanted to=
 do. So we are giving them a standalone database with an Excel file for =
their parameters. We did this for Hornet already, so we have precedence for=
 breaking off the system this way. So we're going to do the same situation =
for Redwood that we did for Hornet and give them a standalone library.

11:12
Perfect. So I can lean on Pari for the specific details there. It =
sounds like then Global Component Database, maybe we will track and just =
track it as this. But there's really no action there. Right. Like that work=
 is being done, like the execution.

11:32
Yeah, I know. Tim just joined. I=
 had handed off the instructions that I created when I did Hornet I handed =
off to Tim, he's following those instructions to create their standalone =
library.

11:45
Sweet.

11:45
And that's what we want them to use for day =
one. Logical separation is they would start pointing to that standalone =
library and not our global master library that everyone in Collins, you =
know, can get into. So we want, we want them to be separated out at that =
point.

12:07
Got it. So Tim is doing that. Is that work being done there =
like that building the database tracked in Capital Edge, do you know?

12:21
I don't know if it's tracked in Capital Edge. I mean, we have a =
charge number we were given. I don't know if any of that's being tracked in=
 Capital Edge though.

12:32
Okay. And so Global Component Database. Is =
this like a light something that's licensed right now from Siemens or is =
this.

12:42
Yes, the actual. The application name is Edmund. We had tagged=
 it Global Component Database internally, but the EDM library is what they =
call it.

12:58
Got it. And so this one I think we can pull into our =
inventory and probably track as no action because they're going to be =
provided with the library that Tim is building and then mentor graphics. =
They will continue to maintain their current use of connecting to the new =
database as the client for day one and then by day two, physical separation=
, it's going to be whatever strategy they choose, get their own licenses, =
install it on the new PC, whatever.

13:37
It wasn't clear to me. I haven't=
 been asked at this point to provide any, you know, estimates for what =
licensing they have to purchase. I'm not sure how that's being handled by =
the divestiture group. And you know, what. What does Collins have to =
provide to Safran to say this is what we think you need to go get.

14:01
That would be incredibly helpful if. I mean. Yeah, so that's sort of where =
we're going next is we need to start to understand that one, make sure that=
 those license costs were accounted for in the tsa because the TSA =
revisions that are being under undergone right now I think reflects the =
latest view of. Here's the apps that you will continue to use the Collins =
license for after day one, between day one and day two. And I think that we=
. Those counts would help us understand one, how many users there are and =
where they are. I had Bangalore, I think said that there were Bangalore =
folks here.

14:50
There's. Yeah, Bangalore Wolverhampton and a few in =
Rockford.

15:00
Bangalore Wolverhampton. And let me write down Rockford. =
Yes. Okay.

15:09
Those are the sites that I'm aware of.

15:12
Do you have an approximate off the top of your head? Do you know how Many =
licenses we have.

15:17
Oh, well, it's our primary tool for all of Collins=
 and so we have a huge number of licenses. I'd have to look at the actual =
user count for those groups.

15:30
Yeah. And I think that that's the =
question is we need to find out the user count for.

15:34
Yeah, they're not going to want to match the licensing we have.

15:37
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, like the actuation user count. Exactly.

15:45
Again, it's a pretty massive tool suite. They may not even want all =
of the features that we have. That group may use a. In Collins as a whole.

15:59
Okay, okay, yeah, that would make sense.

16:03
That would have to be validated with that divestiture group on what it is =
they're going to require for licensing. I can put best estimate for that.

16:17
Okay, yeah, that would be really helpful if you could just take that =
offline and check on. Yeah. For that group, the user counts and then what =
the recommended approach might be for licensing and then we can validate =
with the divestiture group.

16:36
And we're not. We're not charging back =
specifically for each between day one and day two. We're not charging =
Saffron like line item by line item for licensing. It's just kind of a big =
bucket, right?

16:53
Yeah, exactly. It's a big bucket. The bucket. The =
cost that they pay for the bucket is supposed to, in theory, reflect the =
sum total cost of all of the apps that are provided under that bucket. And =
they can't pick and choose. I want this app, I don't want this app, I want =
whatever. So they'll get it sort of as is like as we have it now. And =
that's the onus is on the legal team and our team to make sure that that =
bucket is appropriately costed and sized according to what they're going to=
 be given.

17:26
Okay.

17:27
Yeah.

17:27
And I know in between day one =
and day two, they're going to be considered contractors. Correct.

17:36
So I don't think so. I know that was the approach with Hornet. I think that=
 there are remaining employees and there's going to be just a flag put on =
them in active directory that marks them as divested. So I think for Hornet=
 it was. It did go that approach. And for this one, there's complicating =
factors. Right. And I think that they are going to continue to be employees=
.

18:05
Okay. That might actually, I know I've gotten some inquiries from =
the vendor which I've deflected so far, but they were concerned about the =
possibility of us acting as reseller. And as long as the divested users are=
 still employees, that's not a concern. Or if they were onboarded =
contractors, that's typically not a concern either. It's when we're acting =
as unauthorized resellers of their licensing where they start getting a =
little antsy. So we want to make sure that we're not violating any rules =
there.

18:56
Yeah, absolutely. And one of my colleagues, Tim Patrick on =
the business managed apps team has a regular cadence. I think he's actually=
 on the call right now with the contracts team who I think can help =
facilitate those conversations. Right. With Siemens, I think that there's =
some notice that they typically send like a. And some type of consent that =
gets sent to Siemens. Like basically outlining here's the structure, here's=
 how we plan to do it.

19:23
That would be awesome if they actually. Yeah.=
 If there was just some agreement, that would be even better.

19:28
Yeah, that's I think their whole job. So I'll make a note to add this to =
the list of follow ups with Tim. If you can help me understand the user =
counts, that would be really helpful just for like our records. And then =
also I'm sure that the contracts team will ask that at some point too. And =
we, I can make sure that I know it gets sent to them to make sure that this=
 one gets on their radar because I'm sure that they have like Siemens =
overall. But if this is like the eda.

19:57
Yeah, I would definitely make =
sure they're included, including Siemens eda. Because even though they're =
technically one company, you know, same situation that we've had where when=
 they got bought out, you know, one company, but those two sides of the =
house were treated a little bit differently.

20:13
Yeah.

20:13
So I want to make sure that's all included.

20:16
Yep, exactly. Exactly. =
So I'll send a note and CC this team on that. And otherwise I think that =
that pretty much covers the questions that I had GerBTool locally installed=
 licenses. Do you know for GerBTool after day one they'll still use the =
Collins licenses or can you help pull the user accounts for that group that=
 might use it actuation folks?

20:45
Yeah. And I think if out on the =
Redwood SharePoint sites is there users. I know that was being kept close =
to the vest for a while. I think I saw a preliminary one at some point.

21:02
Oh, the census.

21:04
Yeah. Honestly the only way for me to know =
would be if I asked the licensing team to run a report for give me the =
users from the last year or two or you know, some, some date and bumped him=
 up against that list.

21:21
Yeah, I, so I, I definitely have a Copy =
that's been shared with our team and I just need to ask Tori probably and =
Anthony about, I think, the sensitivity of that because I. I got the same =
impression that it is sort of being held.

21:40
Yeah. The draft ones that =
were being sent around, I know we had passwords and were under orders not =
to share and. Yeah, and I understand.

21:48
Yeah. But I'm sure that there =
would be no problem. And our team, we can do that, like, check too. If the =
license team can pull the active users from the last year and we get that =
list, I can bump it up against the latest census that I have from like a =
month ago and we can get that list no problem, both for Mentor and for grr.=
 But let me speak with the folks on my team about sharing this. I'm sure =
that it's no problem with like Collins, folks who are read in and it sounds=
 like you are. So let me see about what I can do for sharing that. But in =
the meantime, if you can reach out to the licensing team and ask for a =
report on mentor graphics and GRBTool, I think that that would help =
jumpstart it. Okay, sweet. So those two will track and then Global =
Component Database. I'm going to just chat with Tim and Anthony and Pari =
and see what they think. I don't think it needs to be tracked because the =
work is already being done. Tim, you're driving. It's going to replace GCD =
or the Siemens EDM library. And ultimately that doesn't make a difference =
as long as it's done before. As long as it's built by day one for actuation=
, I don't think they care because Mentor Graphics will, like, plug right =
into it. This is what you did for Hornet.

23:09
And day one, I know that =
that's, you know, shifted. What's the current day one?

23:16
Yeah, yeah. So the current day one is May 31st.

23:19
Okay.

23:21
Is this something. I'm not sure what the timeline looks like, but is this =
something that we were planning to have ready for May 31st?

23:30
Yeah, I don't think that's it. Tim's gotten pretty far with it already, so =
I don't see that as being a problem.

23:38
Sweet. Yeah.

23:39
You can correct me if I'm. No, no, that's. So far everything.

23:43
I know everything's on track, so we're good. 52 days as leadership reminded=
 us about 10 times. This morning we have our weekly leadership call. And I =
heard the number 52 so many times, so it's definitely on the brain.

23:59
Yeah. Now that if we retrieve the license.

24:02
Info from the Siemens EDA=
 side that might be pretty extensive because that's.

24:10
Tim, you and I can. We might need to chat offline and see how we can filter=
 that because otherwise it's, it's gonna be.

24:16
Yeah, my creature. Break that up between locations or just.

24:23
Pick a few choice licenses because there's so many license features. Right.=
 Have to pick some. Some specific license features.

24:34
Okay. Okay. And I'll see about getting you a copy of the census that I have=
, if that would help at all.

24:43
That my. The last one I saw. So it's =
entirely possible that names have shifted since then?

24:54
Yeah, I think somewhat. I'm not sure how much shifting has gone on. Like I =
think here and there probably, but probably not a whole, whole lot. Cool. =
Okie dokie. Well, I've got these actions. I'll make sure that you're cc'd =
on the email to the contracts team. Do you know who the Vendor is.

25:18
For GrBTool wise software, I believe.

25:23
Let me double check. I =
actually should have that gcd.

25:29
I'm just going to go verifying that.

25:30
But I'm pretty sure it's WWISE because then, yeah, for wwise, I can =
get that put onto the contracts team's radar as well. At the same time as.

25:48
Yes, it's wyse W I S E WYSE Software.

25:52
Perfect. Okay, so I'll =
send an email to them about Siemens EDA and Wise Software Girb tool that we=
 need to get that consent agreement done for and then GCD we won't track. =
Christine, you and Tim can work on pulling the user accounts, the actuation=
 user accounts for Mentor Graphics and Grub tool if possible. And I'm going=
 to follow up on the census and sharing that. Okay, sweet.

26:21
And those, I mean the user counts and the licensing, that's basically for =
Saffron to go make their decisions before day two. It's not really an =
action that we're going to use with it, but they're going to go do their =
procurements.

26:36
Yeah, yeah, I think so. I do think that on our side =
the business Managed Ask team will be tasked with. Oh, I'm sorry.

26:46
Breaking up a little bit.

26:47
Yeah, hold on one second. So on our side, =
I think we might be tasked with verifying that all of the licenses that are=
 going to be provided under TSA have been accounted for in those TSA =
costing efforts. So for us I think it's mostly just a verification that =
they were accounted for and part of those buckets. And then for Saffron. =
Yeah, it will help them between day one and day two make the decision of =
what they want to do, but I think that that's less important. It's. We have=
 to protect, like Collins and ensure that we've accounted for those if it's=
 something that we're paying for.

27:30
If the vendor pushes again on =
contacts, me or. We talked to him about technical issues, too, regarding =
licensing for the divestiture. Is there somebody on your contracts team =
that I can have them go to? Because I'm not sure I'm comfortable fielding =
those.

27:49
Absolutely. Let me get you a name. I'll ping you a name on =
teams on Collins. And let me get you a name because there's a few and =
there's someone on our team that's dedicated interfacing with them. So I'll=
 get you a name, and I'll ping it to you. Okay, perfect.

28:05
Yeah. I don't want to misspeak and say something different than what =
they're talking to the vendors about.

28:13
And it's one thing off your =
plate, you know, like, it's one less thing to worry about.

28:17
Awesome. Okay.

28:18
Sick. Okay. Well, Christine, Tim, Jesse, thank you so=
 much for joining. I'll send out some notes, and we'll keep pushing. I =
think that this sort of answers the questions, but if anything else, I'll =
just probably ping you. Okay, cool. All right, thank you, Matt. Thank you =
all so much. I appreciate it. All right, thanks.

28:36
Bye.

it&#x27;s just the Global Component Database, but just trying to understand=

6">So the two are, you know, we&#x27;ve been working on since last year now=
. It&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a little misleading the way they&#x27;re listed. The=
 global component database is the electrical library, so that&#x27;s one =
and the same. It actually is from Mentographics was the vendor. It&#x27;s =
now Siemens. Siemens bought out Mentographics. So you&#x27;ll see those =
used somewhat interchangeably. Menor graphics being its own listing. =
That&#x27;s a vendor name. And depending on who you talk to, it&#x27;s =
going to mean different applications because they have a pretty massive =
suite of tools. So I don&#x27;t know in that particular case necessarily =
what group of tools they are referring to.</div></div><div =

:1.6">Yeah. And I can go back and look at the application inventory, but I =
think that that makes sense. I did hear that this morning that it was =
acquired by Siemens. And if it&#x27;s an app, and if it&#x27;s not an app, =
it&#x27;s a suite of tools, then I don&#x27;t think we need to track it =
outside of what we&#x27;re already tracking because we have those Siemens =
tools like Siemens nx, we have all of those Siemens tools already accounted=
 for. And so if this to you is not like a one particular application that =
we&#x27;re using, there&#x27;s no need to add it.</div></div><div =

6">Yeah, this might be a little bit different than some of the other =
Siemens tools. I mean demographics is now Siemens eda, so it is part of =
Siemens, but I know it. It generally ends up in its own bucket when =
we&#x27;re talking about tool divestitures or migrations. So I suspect this=
 refers to the client applications which, you know, we have various methods=
 that those get deployed out. But again for client applications, the =
expectation with the divestiture is they&#x27;re going to have to do local =
installs and obtain their own licensing prior to physical separation. That =
for the time being they&#x27;re still relying on our Software deployments =
for clients. And they&#x27;re still tapping into Collins licensing and that=
 would continue during logical separation, but prior to physical =
they&#x27;d have to have local installs so that they&#x27;re no longer =
dependent on our deployment methods.</div></div><div =

6">Yeah, for them, yes. And we went back and forth a lot last year, =
beginning of this year originally, I think the Laksme and the Redwood team =
had signed up for a clone and cleanse of the existing system. But it&#x27;s=
 a server based system, it&#x27;s got an Oracle database and it was way =

reach out to the licensing team and ask for a report on mentor graphics and=
 GRBTool, I think that that would help jumpstart it. Okay, sweet. So those =

a verification that they were accounted for and part of those buckets. And =
then for Saffron. Yeah, it will help them between day one and day two make =
the decision of what they want to do, but I think that that&#x27;s less =
