   -

   The discussion centers on organizing support for User Acceptance Testing
   (UAT) in Jeff's absence.
   -

   Avinash was mistakenly thought to be involved in UAT; he clarified he's
   not currently supporting that effort and has only had minimal contact (o=
ne
   or two calls) outside of the main meetings.
   -

   There is some confusion regarding who should be coordinating UAT-related
   responsibilities, especially amid organizational changes (notably,
   additional responsibilities for Chukai are being shifted).
   -

   Piers, who was expected to work on UAT, is out of office in Panama and
   will not return until Monday, June 23, 2025, having left on Monday, June=
 9.
   This leaves another week without his input.
   -

   The group recognizes the need to identify someone else to support UAT
   activities while Piers is away; Avinash is not available for this.
   -

   Paul joins the meeting and is briefed: the immediate focus is to ensure
   Pierce's UAT support responsibility is covered.
   -

   The service desk, led by Aaron Hicks, was identified as a key resource,
   specifically for setting up a tech bridge to support UAT. Dave Shearer
   manages end-user PCs.
   -

   Aaron Hicks is experienced with such setups and is expected to provide
   both tools and advice for a smooth UAT process. The next step is to reac=
h
   out to him for support.

Avinash0:03
Hey.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator0:03
Good.
Avinash0:04
Thank you. How are you folks?
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator0:07
Busy. Busy with Jeff's asks a new at. I copied you on an email. I know
Piers is not here, so. So you're it.
Avinash0:22
I didn't know that.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator0:23
Ah, well, I didn't either. So I. But so in all seriousness, are you helping
him with the uat? Have you been.
Avinash0:34
No.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator0:35
Attacked?
Avinash0:36
No. No.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator0:37
Okay, so I wanna. Okay, then I don't want to pull you into a wrong meeting
because I was under the assumption that because he attacked you in earlier
calls.
Avinash0:53
Yeah, we just had one or two calls outside of it. No.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator0:56
Okay.
Avinash0:57
Because again, I had a brief chat. I was not really getting a sense of who
should I kind of tag team to say go get what information is it UAT dates,
is it testers? What is it? Because I was like, do we have a list or how are
we going to work this out? And there's. With some of the changes that we
are going through with Chukai here, I have more of her responsibilities
coming over onto me now. So I was not even sure how much of what I would be
better off going here versus somebody from the Spinco organization itself
should be driving. So we had a brief chat, but I didn't even know that he
was out of office till this morning. In my conversation with Sakai, she
said, did you not have that conversation? I was like, no, I did not be out
of office.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator1:55
So. Okay, no, that's good to know. Good to know from the sense that, okay,
at least we, you know, I don't pull you into the wrong things, but, you
know, not good to know in that he will. He's going to have to help us with
the resources or somebody to support uat. And I invited Paul to this
because this was more of a brainstorming session. So. Well, let's maybe
repeat this for Paul. Hey, Paul.
Paul2:19
Hi.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator2:20
Afternoon. Thanks for making the time. So I pulled this group in with
Avinash just to discuss Jeff's ask. And I think Avinash was also mentioning
right or wrong. I pulled him in because I was under the assumption from
prior assumption that, you know, he's been sort of tagged with peers to
support some of the uat. And I think Avinash was just informing me that
that's not necessarily the case. So if so, because he's pulled into other
things and he's not necessarily plugged into uat. So I think from an
assistance perspective will have to find someone else. Paul, then to
support Pierce with UAT activities.
Paul3:09
When's Pierce back?
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator3:11
Two weeks from now.
Paul3:14
Isn't it one week?
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator3:16
No, he was going to Panama for a couple of weeks, so he left Monday. He's
not back till the 23rd, I believe.
Paul3:25
That's more than two weeks.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator3:29
Yeah, nine to the 21st. So, yeah, yeah, he'll be back on Monday.
Paul3:32
He'll be back on the 23rd. So we've got another week without him to
survive. Yeah, Yeah. I suspect he ran out of Runway and never got the
chance to talk to Avinash. I don't. Don't know what happened. Certainly
dropped the ball there, but. So we need to absolutely get in touch. I think
it's Aaron Hicks that runs the service desk, Right?
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator3:59
Yes. Let me. Aaron runs.
Avinash4:05
Yeah.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator4:05
Dave Shearer runs the end user PC, but Aaron Hicks runs the service desk.
Paul4:11
We need Aaron to help us with getting a tech bridge set up. He's done this
before. It's right in his wheelhouse.
Unidentified speaker leading the discussion, possibly a manager or
coordinator4:26
Okay.
Paul4:27
He can probably dust something off that he's already got and follow it, but
he'll give us guidance also.
