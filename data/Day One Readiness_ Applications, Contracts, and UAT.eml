Overview

The discussion centers around the management of applications, logical
separation efforts, Transfer Service Agreements (TSAs), contracts, and User
Acceptance Testing (UAT) in preparation for day one readiness. Key updates
include progress on application copies, TSA integration within engineering,
contract risk management, Safran workshop outcomes, the establishment of a
High Strike Board, and the development of UAT exit criteria and sign-off
processes.
Main Topics Discussed1. Business Managed Applications (BMA)

   - *Application Copies*: Efforts are underway to create copies of
   numerous applications to support daily activities, including tools like
   Excel macros.
   - *Logical Separation*: Minimal impact on BMA with only about five
   relevant applications out of 400. Progress is positive with most logical
   separation tasks proceeding smoothly.
   - *Engineering Scope*: Most TSA-related applications within the VMA
   inventory fall under the engineering TSA. Dedicated applications like
   transfer disposition and data extraction are accounted for in Capital Ed=
ge.

2. Contracts

   - *Current Risk*: Contracts are identified as the primary risk area,
   while other functions are on track for day one.
   - *Safran Questionnaire*: A definitive list of items related to
   contracts will be provided to address Safran's detailed questions.
   - *Detailed Responses*: Actions include providing app and
   vendor-specific details, explaining decisions regarding day one actions,
   and addressing exceptions like HPC computing.

3. Safran Update

   - *New York Workshop*: Conducted last week with several action items
   resulting.
   - *BTS Changes*: Working towards providing a clean copy to Jason by
   midweek, with only minor areas still under discussion.
   - *App and Contract Inventories*: Focus on detailed questions to ensure
   all necessary information is available for day one dispositioning.
   - *Integrations*: Ongoing discussions with legal and D2 leadership; no
   new updates provided.

4. High Strike Board and Heatmaps

   - *High Strike Board*: Managed by William and Khan, serving as a
   comprehensive view of day one readiness and cutover, aligned with
   enterprise expectations.
   - *Heatmaps Accuracy Review*: Starting Thursday, PMs are instructed to
   update heatmaps in Confluence to reflect the latest readiness status.
   - *Team Coordination*: Emphasis on reviewing application details to
   prevent oversight, with upcoming reviews and potential clean-ups planned=
.

5. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Exit Criteria and Sign-Off

   - *Package Development*: Nicole, Jen, Noah, and Chris French are
   creating a package to define UAT success criteria and sign-off framework=
.
   - *Timeline*:
      - Preview with Jason expected by Thursday.
      - Dedicated session with Jason likely later today.
      - Finalization and presentation to SMO by mid to early next week.
   - *Sign-Off Process*: Ensures alignment and acceptance from SMO and
   functional coordinators, despite tight scheduling constraints.
   - *Concerns*: Potential challenges with functional sign-off timing, but
   plans are in place to meet deadlines.

Action Items and Follow-Ups

   - *Provide Definitive List*: Deliver a definitive list related to
   contracts as part of the Safran questionnaire.
   - *Review UAT Package*: Await and review the UAT exit criteria and
   sign-off package once drafted.
   - *Update Heatmaps*: PMs to update heatmaps in Confluence by Thursday to
   ensure accurate readiness status.
   - *Prepare for High Strike Board Review*: Ensure all project details are
   current and ready for the upcoming review process.
   - *Coordinate with Legal*: Acknowledge and accommodate Legal's review
   process for all communications and documents.
   - *Support UAT Sign-Off*: Assist in the finalization and endorsement of
   the UAT sign-off package to meet the required timeline.

Key Dates and Figures

   - *Application Count*: Approximately 400 applications, with about five
   requiring logical separation.
   - *Tasks for Day Two Authentication*: Around 53 tasks related to
   authentication strategies and cleanup.
   - *Safran BTS Deliverable*: Expected by midweek.
   - *Heatmaps Review Start*: Thursday of the current week.
   - *UAT Sign-Off Presentation*: Mid to early next week.
   - *Team Availability*: Collins will be on holiday on Friday.

Aaron0:00
Has like numerous applications that they're working to create a copy for.
Logical separation isn't that big of a thing for bma. It's more so, you
know, finding these old tools that you know, they want copies of so that
they can continue doing their daily activities, whether it be like an Excel
like macro, there's so many of those. But in terms of logical separation
work that is also going well. There's only like five applications that
actually applies to out of our 400. So yeah, that's also going well.
Meeting Host0:40
Okay. And for everything that's, that's going to be, there's a, I would say
like, like a handful of them out of the broader thing that's going to be
TSA right there.
Aaron0:53
We have a lot of TSAs for sure that that falls within our engineering EN01
scope.
Meeting Host1:01
That's where I was going to go. That's all under the engineering. That's
all under the engineering tsa, correct?
Aaron1:07
Yeah.
Meeting Host1:09
So is it fair to say that all of the functions for the TSA apps in the VMA
inventory are under engineering?
Aaron1:18
No, because there are. I need to double check that, but I believe so. I
think the ones that are within dedicated sites, they are dedicated
applications and those are our transfer disposition, which is, you know,
taking contract and getting it.
Colleague1:38
Over to actuarial the transfers. And the TSAs will be in capital edge as
well accounted for as any data extract or logical separation activities as
well. So you could have dedicated at a site with determine target landing
zone type task, for example, that's a tsa, so those are certainly in there.
So I think that Net net what we're saying really is that capital Edge I
think overstates day one risk for that reason because it's more of a day
two item anyway. Things like determine the authentication strategy is a big
one. I think that we have 53 or so tasks that are really day two
authentication, cleanup, add, remove, actuation, users, email strategy,
things like that. So I think that we can expect a meaningful drop in task
count as all of the work that we've been doing gets synced into the actual
execution status. And then as Pari said, the actual logical separation
activities are commencing in full force.
Meeting Host2:48
Okay, okay. All right. So, so contracts is the big risk at this moment in
time. Everything else is executing according to plan, on track for day one.
We have line of sight into like all the transfers, all the TSA and anything
that is TSA is part of the engineering tsa. Is there, is there anything
else that we haven't covered?
Aaron3:13
We're Working through that here. And I can get you a definitive list that's
part of the Saffron like questionnaire.
Chris3:20
Right.
Aaron3:20
Where like they want a definitive list.
Meeting Host3:22
Right.
Aaron3:23
So.
Meeting Host3:24
Okay. Okay, that would be good. All right. I think that's great for
business managed apps. I think the other big area is contracts. And I know,
James, we connected earlier. We have some actions. So broadly speaking,
team, this is more for everybody's awareness. There's a number of questions
coming on contracts. So this is going to be an effort that we're going to
drive to support the responses back to Safran as well as just get a better
understanding of the plan for contracts on day one. Anyways, what that
means is it's going to require, I think, a little bit of more detail around
each of the questions that we've gotten and it's going to be line by line
and probably app and vendor specific. So just in case we don't have the
knowledge around it for whatever reason, we're going to reach out and ask
questions either to you or the PMs to help us basically understand what
does the app exactly do. And as an example, if we are saying that there is
no action for an application on day one and we don't need to do anything to
it, who made the decision, why is it okay to do that? And the answer could
be as simple as we found out later that actuation doesn't actually use
this, or we found out that there's no way to logically separate it and
we're just going to take away the access on day one, things like that. A
good example of this is HPC computing, of course, right in Ross Law, that
we have a very good line of sight on, but there may be more that come down
this route. Just so everybody's aware. Okay. And maybe two minutes. Ken,
you want to provide a quick update on, like Safran and where we stand with
everything there?
Jason5:18
Yeah. So we had the New York workshop last week. A lot of action items came
out of that. But really the biggest things I'll try to touch on are the
bts. We are working through all of Safran's changes, aiming to provide kind
of a clean copy to Jason by midweek this week. So that's one thing I'd say
we're almost aligned on that. There's only like three, four smaller areas
where there's still some back and forth, but for the most part we're almost
set there, so that's positive. The second big takeaway, I would say, is
what Aaron just mentioned. Fran's asking for a lot of detailed questions on
the app and contract inventories for them to marry up to make sure that
they have all the information that they need on day one dispositioning. So
that's probably gonna be a big focus for us in the next two weeks. And then
the third probably key takeaway out of that was the integrations piece,
which is still kind of an ongoing discussion with legal in D2 leadership.
So I don't have a further update on that, but it's still continuing to be
discussed.
Meeting Host6:34
I think overall trending really well.
Ken6:37
Right.
Meeting Host6:37
I. I think there's a number of calls with SON directly where we're having a
great conversation with them. Ken, would you agree? Yeah, yeah.
Jason6:46
No, I would say really recent engagement has been much better. We're being
a lot more transparent. The one thing I want to call out to everyone is
Legal is being very, very focused on reviewing anything that we send to
them. So even if it's like meeting minutes or anything of that nature,
Legal has to review it. It takes about three or four days. So whenever we
get kind of a response to Safran, we just need to make sure we take that
questions.
Meeting Host7:26
Okay. Two other items just so everybody has the update on what you'll see
probably in 15 minutes.
Ken7:35
Right.
Meeting Host7:35
I'll give you a quick preview on this. There's this concept of a High
Strike Board that William and Khan are going to manage going forward. The
High Strike board is meant to be kind of a catch all for day one readiness
and cutover. Think of it as a summary view of all the heat maps. Right. In
a way or a summary view of all the projects. That High Strike board is very
closely aligned with what despite wants to see. And there's going to be a
big element of heatmaps accuracy review starting this Thursday. So the
guidance that we've given to all the PMs is to update those items. I would
say that once those are updated and those all live in Confluence, it would
be good for the teams to get a better understanding of where the latest
things are in Confluence. And just so we as ey have a plan of where we
stand with the day one readiness for all the apps individually.
Ken8:40
Right.
Meeting Host8:40
So now with so little time left, the team is really, when I say team, I
mean the broader team is looking at all of the details app by app to make
sure that nothing gets missed. So a question gets come on a very specific
application. And so that's why we want to make sure that the heat mounts
are ready to go and the high Strike board is ready to go there. There will
be probably more check ins around this and, and probably a request to clean
that up if anything is missed. But we'll start the review on the Thursday
program. Review this this week. Let me stop there for a second. Any
question? Okay. Other pretty big item is UAT exit criteria and sign off. So
this is probably more pertaining to Chris and Pooja. To the two of you. I
don't know if you've seen this package, but Nicole, Jen, Noah and Chris
French have been kind of working this.
Ken9:40
Right.
Meeting Host9:40
To create a package. It's meant to show what does success for UAT look
like, meaning pass versus fail rate, open defects, etc. As well as a
framework for how we expect to get signed up from all the functions to make
sure that we have documented and done like a CYA to make sure that UAT is
complete and we can move into the next phase.
Ken10:03
Right.
Meeting Host10:04
This is going to be a pretty important thing. That is not only something
that Jason has a pretty big eye on, but what also he needs to take it up to
Sarah and present it to her. Sarah. Sarah is the lead for the snr. This is
coming soon. I think it would be good for, for maybe you to provide some
commentary on this if you, if you come across it. I'm not sure if you've
seen it, but as soon as we have a draft of it and we start previewing it, I
will make sure to give it over to you. So you can, you can see kind of like
what, what they're doing to get signed up on uat.
Pooja10:37
And you said Nicole Noah and Jen and Despina are putting this package
together.
Meeting Host10:43
Nicole, Noah, Jen, with help from Chris French. Yes. So it's primary. So
again, this is primarily being driven by, by Collins.
Ken10:52
Right.
Meeting Host10:53
We're not really driving it. What we're able to do now is provide like a
framework or provide like templates. But they've been pretty clear that
they want to drive it forward and they want to have the 10 on it. So we
haven't been able to kind of really dig in and just create it ourselves,
which is okay. Right. They're the ones owning uat. I'm just mentioning it
here because I can very clearly see that this gets presented to Jason and
there's an ask that comes to say, ey, how do we do it? How do you normally
see this going? Is this sufficient to get signed off, you know, et cetera,
et cetera. So we may just need to be able to opine on it if need it.
Pooja11:31
Sure, yeah. Send it our way here and as soon as you have a draft and we can
at least be aware and review it.
Meeting Host11:38
Yeah, I've been asking for that draft, I'll be honest with you, but I. I
just haven't seen anything myself. So it'll be. It'll be new for all of us.
Ken11:47
Here.
Chris11:48
Just a general question. Yeah, I just had a general question on that. I
know UAT is scheduled to end by end of week and this package sounds like it
won't be ready until. Until next week. I mean, is there going to be enough
time to get functional sign off? I'm sure this is a question that's been
asked. I'm just curious.
Meeting Host12:08
It's supposed to go until end of next week, right? 4:25.
Chris12:10
Yeah, end of next week.
Jason12:12
Right.
Chris12:12
And I just know, like the functions haven't been super. It's fine, we can
take it off. But I'm just curious how this is going to work.
Meeting Host12:20
So the way this is going to work, I'll. I'll share the timeline. Right. We
aligned with this yesterday. Aligned on this yesterday. Sometime between, I
would say probably Thursday, I would say. So the plan is today we would
preview it with Jason. I think they're saying that they might have
something later today. We'll have a dedicated session with Jason on this.
Probably by Thursday.
Ken12:43
Right.
Meeting Host12:44
I would say probably Thursday is when we would get Jason's feedback on it
and try to understand a little bit more on like where he's thinking and how
that package looks overall. But before that, we probably won't have the
details. That gives us basically like Friday, when columns is basically off=
.
Ken12:57
Right.
Meeting Host12:58
Just so everybody's aware they're going to be on holiday. So we have Friday
and maybe I would say Monday.
Ken13:03
Right.
Meeting Host13:03
To kind of opine and make updates. If something comes down the pipeline at
that point, it's going to be, I'll say, unquote, final. And then we need to
take it to the SMO by mid to early next week to show it to them and make
sure that they're aligned on what the signup process looks like. Because
somebody not us needs to sign off on UAT and say that this is done and
accept that that includes the smo, that includes the functional
coordinators. So, Chris, to answer your question, you know, a little bit
more directly, it's going to be cutting it close, but it should be within
the time frame to get the site off. Okay.
Chris13:46
No, yeah, thanks for having me.
Meeting Host13:49
I was curious. Thanks. It's a good point because, you know, if we get into
a point next week where somebody's not aligned on the sign off, like
process or the framework of it, then we kind of run into the talk about
like, well, we're testing, but we need to make sure that somebody out there
who's doing the sign off is aligned and reviewing and prioritizing that so
we get it in time to be able to continue down the path of preparing the
program. So you'll see all this. Oh, go ahead, go ahead.
Pooja14:25
It's on a separate topic, but I know you would agree next week. Have you? I
know you are probably not.
Colleague14:33
It's similar.

color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Okay. Okay, that would be goo=
d. All right. I think that&#39;s great for business managed apps. I think t=
he other big area is contracts. And I know, James, we connected earlier. We=
 have some actions. So broadly speaking, team, this is more for everybody&#=
39;s awareness. There&#39;s a number of questions coming on contracts. So t=
his is going to be an effort that we&#39;re going to drive to support the r=
esponses back to Safran as well as just get a better understanding of the p=
lan for contracts on day one. Anyways, what that means is it&#39;s going to=
 require, I think, a little bit of more detail around each of the questions=
 that we&#39;ve gotten and it&#39;s going to be line by line and probably a=
pp and vendor specific. So just in case we don&#39;t have the knowledge aro=
und it for whatever reason, we&#39;re going to reach out and ask questions =
either to you or the PMs to help us basically understand what does the app =
exactly do. And as an example, if we are saying that there is no action for=
 an application on day one and we don&#39;t need to do anything to it, who =
made the decision, why is it okay to do that? And the answer could be as si=
mple as we found out later that actuation doesn&#39;t actually use this, or=
 we found out that there&#39;s no way to logically separate it and we&#39;r=
e just going to take away the access on day one, things like that. A good e=
xample of this is HPC computing, of course, right in Ross Law, that we have=
 a very good line of sight on, but there may be more that come down this ro=
ute. Just so everybody&#39;s aware. Okay. And maybe two minutes. Ken, you w=
ant to provide a quick update on, like Safran and where we stand with every=
thing there?</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;backg=

height:1.6">Yeah. So we had the New York workshop last week. A lot of actio=

ch on are the bts. We are working through all of Safran&#39;s changes, aimi=
ng to provide kind of a clean copy to Jason by midweek this week. So that&#=
39;s one thing I&#39;d say we&#39;re almost aligned on that. There&#39;s on=
ly like three, four smaller areas where there&#39;s still some back and for=
th, but for the most part we&#39;re almost set there, so that&#39;s positiv=
e. The second big takeaway, I would say, is what Aaron just mentioned. Fran=
&#39;s asking for a lot of detailed questions on the app and contract inven=
tories for them to marry up to make sure that they have all the information=
 that they need on day one dispositioning. So that&#39;s probably gonna be =
a big focus for us in the next two weeks. And then the third probably key t=
akeaway out of that was the integrations piece, which is still kind of an o=
ngoing discussion with legal in D2 leadership. So I don&#39;t have a furthe=
r update on that, but it&#39;s still continuing to be discussed.</div></div=

those items. I would say that once those are updated and those all live in =
