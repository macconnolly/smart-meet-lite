UAT Planning Execution Communication Strategy Alignment

# Meeting Summary =20
**Date:** June 20, 2025 =20
**Participants:** Rakesh,=
 Sukai, Jessica, Paul, Vicki, Srinivas, and others =20
**Duration:** Not specified, but reference to a follow-up in a "couple =
hours."

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. UAT (User Acceptance =
Testing) Planning & Execution =20

#### Regional & Remote Testing =20
- There was an extended discussion regarding the structure of regional =
testing, especially APAC remote execution.
  - **Remote Testing:** =20
    - Clarified that remote testing is taking place in APAC, particularly =
on 7/2, starting at 6:30 AM Pacific Time.
    - Purpose is to enable teams =
in APAC to undertake end-to-end tests instead of limited individual tests.
  - **Slide Updates:** =20
    - Discussion about how to visualize APAC's =
role in the schedule=E2=80=94debated adding a distinct column vs. an =
asterisk/note. =20
    - Decided on an asterisk/narrative to avoid =
suggesting that APAC can test all areas, especially if defects exist (e.g.,=
 logistics), with the note that APAC will begin testing on 7/2 with what is=
 available.
  - **UAT1 Column:** =20
    - Clarified the meaning behind the=
 UAT 1 column for 7/7=E2=80=937/11, indicating it includes all items the =
team deems ready (not just three specific items).
    - The green items =
indicate ongoing end-to-end and defect-fixing work, not limited only to =
those three items.
    - Buffer available for late-order management =
scripting.

#### Dependencies on Predecessor Tasks =20
- Certain professional modules (notably Hyperion) can only be tested in the=
 second week due to dependencies=E2=80=94outputs from previous tests are =
required to complete this phase.

#### Adjacents and Access =20
- Outside the 14 core systems, adjacent systems will also be used in =
end-to-end and parallel run (PRV) testing, although no changes are being =
made in BRV.
- Emphasis on ensuring testers are provisioned and all =
schedules aligned, with 6/25 selected as the target date for aligning the =
hour-by-hour schedule.

#### Tester Identification =20
- There is an active effort to identify UAT testers in regions, especially =
for critical systems (notably tax systems).
  - Ben Goldstein is =
collaborating on this.
  - Deadline for identifying testers: **6/22**.
  - A risk exists because some regional finance or tax teams may not yet be=
 hired (e.g., Solstice finance/tax team); alternatives (Mexico, Romania) =
are being considered.
  - Will Johnson is on heightened alert in case =
escalation is required.

### 2. Execution Dashboard & Reporting

#### Script Management =20
- Script finalization for UAT is ongoing for =
three sub-functional areas, to be fully ready by weekend/Monday.
- Daily script execution will be tracked:
  - Number of scripts =
planned/completed.
  - Scripts stopped due to defects/issues.
  - Scripts at risk or delayed.
- Reminder to ensure data on dashboards =
makes logical sense (avoiding inconsistencies like more =E2=80=9Cnot =
started=E2=80=9D than total scripts).

#### Defect Tracking =20
- A revised defect management dashboard is under development:
  - Number and severity/categorization of defects will be tracked and =
reported.
  - Dashboards to be updated at least daily, possibly =
near-real-time.
  - Leadership (especially "he"=E2=80=94likely referring to=
 senior management or Jeff) will see summarized updates, not technical =
process details.

#### HR/ADP Testing =20
- HR ADP testing is managed and =
tracked independently by the ADP team:
  - Sandra and Kelly Rosen are the =
business contacts.
  - Not included in the main dashboard but readiness for=
 questions is advised.

#### War Room & Communication Cadence =20
- War room and meeting operating system (MOS) are finalized in a separate =
planner but not yet included on slides.
- Plan to establish and document =
the cadence, including bridge line and scrum call setup.
  - Meetings to be scheduled by this afternoon.
- Reporting will occur =
**twice daily:** =20
  - Morning: Planned activities.
  - Afternoon: Actuals and outcomes.
- A distribution list for these =
communications will be created and circulated for review.

### 3. Communication Strategy

#### Email Sender/Recipient Strategy =20
- Aim to provide all major communications from a recognizable source =
(=E2=80=9CPaul=E2=80=9D) to ensure high open/read rates and establish =
authority.
- Vicki may send more targeted, secondary communications; all =
responses regarding detailed questions can be directed to Vicki (her role =
and name will be introduced in broader emails to foster recognition).
- Discussion about including other possible senders (Pierce) due to =
bandwidth but agreed the primary sender should be highly recognized to the =
audience.
- Over-communication is preferred over risk of insufficient =
updates.

#### Stakeholder Inclusion =20
- Jeff (senior exec) and other =
tower leads for both Solstice and EIT to be routinely copied.
- Testing team members and other stakeholders as identified will also be =
included.

---

## Key Decisions and Agreements

- **Visualization of =
APAC=E2=80=99s Participation:** Use an asterisk/narrative instead of a new =
column for remote APAC testing commencing 7/2, reflecting testing will =
depend on defect resolution.
- **Hyperion Testing:** Hyperion module =
testing deferred to the second week due to dependency on previous test =
outputs.
- **Tester Identification:** Immediate follow-up with Ben =
Goldstein and possible escalation to Will Johnson if testers are not =
secured by 6/22.
- **Communication:**=20
  - Major comms from Paul; Vicki =
as backup and detailed responder.
  - Comprehensive stakeholder inclusion =
on communications.
  - Distribution list to be verified by Paul and Sukai.
- **Dashboard Enhancements:**=20
  - Ensure logical data presentation.
  - Finalize defect tracking approach for leadership visibility.
- **War Room/MOS:**=20
  - Set up and communication cadence to be =
formalized and included in documentation.

---

## Action Items

1. **Update Slides:**
   - Add asterisk/narrative indicating APAC remote =
testing start and dependency on defect resolution.
   - Ensure schedule =
visual matches reality for UAT1 and regional columns.
   - Move hour-by-hour schedule alignment for adjacents to 6/25.

2. **Tester Identification:**
   - Ben Goldstein to finalize list of =
regional testers (by 6/22).
   - Srinuas to provide update post-meeting =
today and finalize alternate names as needed.
   - If unresolved, escalate =
to Will Johnson and inform Sukai.

3. **Dashboard Preparation:**
   - Clean up execution and defect tracking dashboards for accuracy and =
clarity.
   - Add information about HR/ADP testing management note.
   - Ensure defect categorization and daily status reporting features are =
ready.

4. **MOS/War Room & Meeting Setup:**
   - Document cadence and =
meeting operations (scrum/bridge lines).
   - Schedule kickoffs and =
recurring calls, aiming to set up this afternoon.

5. **Communications:**
   - Create and circulate distribution list for twice-daily reports.
   - Confirm key recipients (add tower leads, Jeff, etc.).
   - Finalize sender structure: primary (Paul), secondary/responder (Vicki)=
, with chain of escalation/coordination clear.

6. **Other:**
   - Review communication and escalation plan with Pierce to check =
bandwidth.
   - Ensure all templates, plans, and reporting materials (slide=
 12) are documented and ready for kickoff.
   - Prepare brief, targeted =
agenda for senior leadership touchpoints.

---

## Follow-Up Points

- **Tester Identification Outcome:** Monitor post-meeting with Ben (June =
20) and escalate to Will Johnson if not resolved.
- **Distribution List =
Review:** Once prepared, circulation to Paul and Sukai for final review.
- **Pierce Bandwidth Check:** Confirm Pierce=E2=80=99s role/agreement =
before finalizing communication escalation plan.
- **Documentation:** Add =
MOS/war room cadence documentation into pack for future reference.
- **Final Meeting Schedule:** Confirm kickoff and cadence once meetings are=
 set this afternoon.

---

## Closing Notes =20

- Consensus was that the =
plan is detailed and on-track, with all reporting and communication =
infrastructure nearly in place.
- Team will meet again in a =E2=80=9Ccouple=
 hours=E2=80=9D to close the loop on remaining open items and finalize the =
immediate action items.

Correct.

0:02
I think we need to.

0:04
It'll have to.

0:11
And I would say Rakesh, you're talking to these. So again there's a lot on =
this slide. Just focus on the key pieces and. And then we can that way jump=
. One thing that's key goes back to publish the hourly the regional testing=
.

0:24
So just a few pieces that'll be.

0:26
Good for him to know and =
he'll stop you if he has questions.

0:30
Sure.

0:30
Okay, so the next slide is. We're going through the daily. My only question=
 is the remote testing is that what we're saying is happening in APAC. So =
remote testing fit 6:30 Pacific 4. Is that remote testing greens in that =
column?

0:54
What's happening at AAPAC on the 7:2? It would be the remote =
testing in APAC.

1:00
Okay. I just wanted to make sure. And then that =
remote testing is allowing them to do end to end. It's allowing them to get=
 in and test something that matters. Correct versus just.

1:13
Okay, do you want us to put.

1:16
So I mean to do good. I just go ahead.

1:20
No, no, I. I understand where you're getting with this. It's going to =
give them the ability to start texting end to end. The question I had on =
this, I apologize, I'm losing my voice is do we want to have that call out =
on here? We didn't want to update the. If you call it the hard schedule =
date since this is more of a call to soft launch of U18. Do you want us to =
at least note this on here? Because we actually don't have it on this slide=
 right now.

1:48
The regional.

1:50
Yeah.

1:50
Yes. So where is. Yeah. =
So is the regional those three rings or is regional even more than the two =
rings?

1:56
It would be.

1:57
See where it says UAT 1 column for 777 11. =
It would be anything in there that the team deems is ready for testing.

2:10
It will not impact development and that's key.

2:15
Okay, so that means it's. They can test a good bit. Yeah, I think there's =
some way we. Because otherwise it seems like UAT one. It seems like we =
tested those three and sound to me I thought the regional team was only =
going to be testing those three. But you're saying no.

2:30
Oh no, no, no. These three are continuation of these end to end and defect =
fixing into very much into this week. I think everything else is, you know,=
 it's a three, five two day duration kind of testing. So the expectation is=
 that it will really be. Most of testing would be done here and defect =
fixing will really happen here. But order management example, there's A lot=
 of end to end scripting there that will go into this week. So it'll. It's =
essentially giving us the buffer to finish it there. So this second column =
is not for.

3:08
Yeah, okay.

3:09
Okay.

3:10
I thought it was a =
combination of both of them. Okay. I thought it was the sist. And then the =
ones that were green was S. It's still happening, but APAC is doing remote =
testing. That's not what this is saying. So where's the APAC piece in here?=
 Or is it not.

3:24
It's just.

3:25
It's not right now.

3:26
Yeah. It would have to be before that UAT1 column. Right. Because that's. =
So we could either adjust that and say that that includes the APAC piece or=
 we would want another column.

3:39
So the only reason I hadn't.

3:41
And it says I don't have a conversation now, I hadn't originally put =
anything in is we're not confident at this point in time what exactly =
they'd be able to test. Perfect world, no defects. They can test everything=
. So we can. That's why I'm wondering if it's just more of a note that in =
our plan, we will hand off to APAC on 7.2. Whatever's available to test. Or=
 if you do, I can put a column in. But I just don't want it to be =
misleading and say, hey, they can test everything if we think there's =
significant defects, let's say in logistics, and we don't hand that off to =
them.

4:12
So I think if we can put sort of like that. What is it? That =
line. I don't know if I'm making sense when I put that line. But hold on, =
let me just.

4:23
Something visual that says, hey, APAC will be inserted =
here.

4:28
Correct.

4:28
Something like.

4:31
Hold on. Yeah, like at the=
 beginning of that UAT1 column.

4:35
Yeah, something like.

4:36
Yeah, this will be depending the defect resolution. Yeah.

4:41
Okay.

4:44
And then.

4:44
And then.

4:44
And then have like a little thingy majiggy =
like that. And then just say uat and then just with an asterisk narrative.

4:52
That's what you'd be like.

4:53
Hey, we don't know which ones, but =
they should start somewhere in the middle. Again, this is a very ugly =
version of this, of what I'm saying. But that way we're not putting in a =
column. We're just kind of putting a. Kind of a stake in the ground. Does =
that make sense for Keshe?

5:06
Yes.

5:06
Yes, it does.

5:07
I'm aligned too. So we'll look at that offline and get that added.

5:11
Okay, perfect.

5:12
All right, back to you.

5:15
The other call out to =
you just for your awareness. We talked through. There's a couple of these =
that we had shown just in person testing. So talk to the team. They're =
going to push that to whatever can be tested remote. A lot of them are more=
 user based and they're not long. But we still said, you know, whatever you=
 can test in the first week. There's only one of them in professional mind.=
 I can't remember what the name was, but there's only one of them. You can =
see at the bottom where we're testing the second week. That one very =
specifically is because there's dependencies from. I think it's items one =
through nine because it's a more of a reporting function. So they don't =
have Hyperion, so they don't have the ability to test the week before =
because they need all the outputs from the other tests. So that's the only =
one that if for whatever reason we were ready we could start to test during=
 week one. They would. But just talking through that with the team because =
of all the other testing going on, there is a very low likelihood to be =
able to test anything for Hyperion just based on its predecessors.

6:14
Okay, okay. All right.

6:19
You need to, you need the transactions.

6:23
You're right.

6:23
Okay.

6:25
All right, so slide number six is.

6:32
The call out here is that for these 2414 critical systems everything is =
already the orange here is the escalation or rather the heightened need =
around the regional tax testing teams. And I think there have been several =
conversations with that tax team and Ben Goldstein to identify the regional=
, the testers in region. And there's active conversations happening and I =
think the expectation is that it will happen again. This is UAT that the =
testers would be identified by this. Well 622. So Srinuas is that realistic=
? The reason, the reason we put it as a risk is because of the =
organizational readiness and having a solstice finance team or tax team in =
region I think is not hired yet. So we're looking, we're looking for =
alternate names.

7:38
Right.

7:39
So we have a call with Ben and some =
output from Mexico, Romania to finalize who the testers are participating =
in our uat. So post today's call, I think we'll be in a better position to =
get this cleaned up in line up what.

7:55
We thought will be. And I think =
this is a good one just to let him know this and then just say, hey, if I =
don't get what I need, this is one thing I might escalate to you. This is =
fine. Okay. All right.

8:07
One other thing too, just for your awareness, =
we had a very good conversation yesterday with Will Johnson. So he also has=
 a heightened awareness of all of this. If we do not have a good outcome =
from the meeting with Ben, we will be having another.

8:22
Excuse me.

8:22
Conversation with Will. So he's on alert for this as well.

8:27
I changed notes with him, so keep me close in that one. Okay. All right, =
this is good. So I think with this one we don't spend so much time because =
it's just a backup what we said on slide five. But it's the same to him. We=
 need his help for that one item. Okay. Slide number seven.

8:44
So these are all the adjacents. So critically, these 14 are where changes =
are happening. And so that's. So this is sort of the heady slide. Now, =
similarly, outside these 14 core systems, there are all these adjacents =
that are being used where there's no changes in brv, but they're being =
consumed as part of the end to end testing and the prv. And so this is =
really more a status on do we have testers in this areas as well? Have we =
provisioned access and have we aligned on all the schedules? So again, for =
UAT schedule, I think we said 625, so the hour by hour schedule would also =
be aligned. So actually I'll move that to 625 here to match everything else=
.

9:31
Okay. All right.

9:32
So these two slides are the same and then =
taxware is the same as the Edicom. It's another tax software testing. And =
it's the same story of regional testers Insul says being identified.

9:48
That's correct.

9:50
Okay.

9:50
Yeah. So it doesn't seem like we'll have =
to spend a lot of time here with Jack. It's just to say, look, we're =
including that visibility in case we have to dig into it if there's a =
defect or anything else. Yep.

10:01
Right. We'll just highlight that. Yep.

10:05
We don't really need to dwell on it that long.

10:07
Yep. Great.

10:08
So a couple of takeaways here. This is the execution dashboard we've =
developed. I'll talk through this and then perhaps highlight here. So all =
this is saying is again, there are script finalization ongoing in these two=
 for UAT happening for these three, and they should be done by this weekend=
 and Monday for the tax app Srinivas. These are the dates we discussed =
yesterday. So that's one point in that. This tracks the number of scripts =
for each of these sub functional areas. This essentially tracks execution =
status as to how many this is again will be Provided at the end of day, =
every day on how many were planned, how many were actually completed, how =
many had got stopped due to defects or any other issues, how many are at =
risk of getting completed, and then what becomes what is delayed? The =
particular call outs here would be these three items which would get closed=
 for UAT by Monday. And then the second call out here is that to the point =
that Jessica mentioned, the HR ADP testing is being managed by adp. They =
have a rigorous process. ADP is managing the execution and reporting of it =
that Sandra and Kelly Rosen and others are plugged into. It's not being =
tracked here. And so if that question comes up, we may want to understand =
if the expectation is everything to be tracked here.

11:56
Okay, no, I think we can answer that question. All right.

12:02
All right. So this would be the daily dashboard.

12:05
Let's make the ones that are. Make them equal. Make them make sense. So if =
you look at number of scripts 5 and then not start at 9 when I first looked=
 at the data.

12:15
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

12:16
That is what we're saying.

12:17
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:18
So if you can just clean up every day.

12:20
Yep, yep, yep. Apologize for =
that one. Yes. Okay.

12:24
All right. And then this is the daily one that =
any.

12:31
Not even daily.

12:32
You can look at it. We can look at it at=
 any time as it relates to scripts and where they are.

12:36
And so this will be correct.

12:39
The next slide. Sorry.

12:41
Oh, yeah. So this one, the defect management. There's a bit of a change I'm=
 editing here because this will address this question on what. Yes. What =
has been run? How many defects are there? What is the severity and =
categorization of those defects? So I think there's a portion of this that =
will change to indicate that, and we're working on that now. But this would=
 be also a defect tracker, however it is. So parts of these will be. I =
think you mentioned rightly that he doesn't care about the sausage making. =
This would be provided perhaps near real time or. Or perhaps by end of day,=
 every day, a dashboard that he's able to see and the leadership is able to=
 see.

13:24
Okay. And do we have the war room and our MOS and how we're =
going to communicate and all of that stuff? Do we have that finalized?

13:35
We do. We have a detailed planner on the mos. I don't think it's =
anywhere here, Jessica, we can talk about.

13:43
And I just want you guys =
to.

13:44
Both be able to see it on.

13:45
Top of your head.

13:45
And then we need to make sure eventually we have it documented. That's One =
of the things you ask.

13:51
For, for the cadence.

13:53
Correct the cadence. Yes. We can add the mos at the bottom. Yep. Sorry, go =
ahead.

13:58
Yeah, add that bottom. We do. We just haven't set up any =
meetings yet. The plan was this afternoon. Get those done. I want to make =
sure we got all these details in here, but we're going to set up a bridge =
line, we're going to set up the scrum calls. All of that has been outlined,=
 but we can make a note on here and even the timing of this. So, Sukhai, I =
do have one question related to this is we're going to send this out twice =
a day. Once in the morning for what our plan is and then once in the =
afternoon with what actually happened throughout the day. Who do you want =
that audience to be outside of? We have our testing team. I'm assuming we =
always copy you. But for example, would you want to copy Jeff? I kind of =
want to have an idea.

14:41
Yeah, I think you copy Jeff. He likes to get. =
He wants to just know everything is fine. I don't think he's going to want =
to go all in such a thinking, but he's going to want to know things are =
good. So I think this team, of course, any other stakeholders, but =
definitely Jeff and I, as we, as we move forward. Okay.

14:59
We will create a sort of a distribution list today that we can send over to=
 you and Paul just to take a look at to make sure that we're not missing =
anybody from the actual testing team. I have a confidence in who we need to=
 copy on this. It's more at the leadership level of I'll include everybody =
in this call, include Jeff, and if there's anybody else you think is =
missing, just let us know.

15:18
Got it. Okay.

15:21
I would actually extend it to the tower leads both for Solstice and eit, =
but we can.

15:29
No, no, no.

15:29
I'm good with that. To me, it's one =
of those things that the more people that need to know that are in the know=
, we.

15:35
Don'T have to follow up, the better.

15:37
So I like that. I like that idea.

15:39
Yeah.

15:39
One of them.

15:40
Yeah.

15:41
Right.

15:41
Agree, agree. Okay. Vicki, if we're lucky, we'll=
 have five minutes. We luckily have two or three. So it's going to be key =
just to hit on the key pieces that you want him to come to know. Yep.

15:56
Right.

15:57
I'm aligned. Okay. So. So my thought here is we have a =
plan. It's very detailed. We know the messaging, have our timeline, that's =
reporting material. If you go to slide number 12 this is what we're going =
to do. We're going to kick off. We'll send this to you have any questions, =
let me know. But we have all the details, the templates, the plans, all =
documented. And then that way. Okay.

16:21
Okay. I have one quick question=
 for you and I know this is super, super quick. A lot of it's going to be =
email. Who are we going to send it from? From Sukai or from Jeff or from =
someone else?

16:35
We are thinking from Vicki, because I'd like to have =
one concise person who can send them out. But also my concern is I want to =
make sure that it's somebody that if we receive a response because somebody=
 has a question on something that, you know, I don't expect Vicki to be =
able to answer all the questions, but she'll know who to reach out to. So =
that was our thought. Unless anybody has a different one.

16:56
I think it should go to Paul. And the reason why I think it should go to =
Paul. Paul's like, oh, cry. I was right is because everybody knows Paul. =
The thing is, a lot of people don't know Vicki yet. And then don't get =
confused like who is this person and why is she sending it? She would =
respond to her. She would not respond to her. Whereas I think it's going to=
 be.

17:17
Good for it to go to Paul.

17:18
Because everybody knows Paul.=
 And so that would be my thought. But Vicki would work very closely with =
Paul. I know Paul. I would love to get your thoughts on that. If you think =
it should be somewhere.

17:31
I'll write it and send it to you so you can =
just copy and paste.

17:35
All right.

17:35
Yeah.

17:38
Okay. I mean, the only other option is Pierce, really. Pierce will be back =
and would have the bandwidth. Mike. Mike concerns only the bandwidth. =
That's all. I'll be in Charlotte next week and.

17:50
Then I would say let go to Vicki. I mean, I just. I think right now I need =
to make sure. I want to connect with peers. Just to make sure. I just need =
to connect with peers first before I make that decision. Go ahead.

18:08
So, Vicki, maybe it's a combination.

18:10
Let's.

18:10
Let's meet offline and figure out if I can support. I will.

18:14
I don't know.

18:15
There's quite a few communications here, right?

18:17
Oh, there's going to be. They're going to be. There's going to be so much =
communication. They're going to ask us to please stop. I mean, okay, I want=
 to over communicate. I want to over communicate rather than under =
communicate. Because if we under communicate, it leaves more risk and we're=
 too much at the crunch time to have risk. So I'd rather people say I =
already know that or I'm aware of that than to say I had no idea.

18:43
So.

18:46
Paul, send out some of the major comms, but identify Vicki as a =
person. So once we get Vicki's name out there and to your point, to kind of=
 they'll start to realize who she is, then we can send some of the maybe =
smaller tailored emails from Vicki. So yeah, we can work that into our plan=
 of what is more of a global calm going to Maybe let's say 50 plus more =
people and then we can have that come from Paul. But even within those =
emails because, hey, if you have questions, please do that to Vicki as =
she's supporting the effort. So.

19:18
Got it.

19:18
We can tackle that. Which I think would be a good.

19:21
Combination because you want to make sure people are going to read them. =
That's, that's the other part. Right.

19:25
People don't read them when =
they see, when they see call, they know read the reason why. I want to =
establish some sense of authority. And then Vicky, again, it was sad, but I=
 like that idea. Very good questions, very good discussions. Let's see how =
it goes. Very good progress. Thank you guys so much. Talk to you in a =
couple hours.

19:44
Thank you. Great progress.

them in professional mind. I can&#x27;t remember what the name was, but =
there&#x27;s only one of them. You can see at the bottom where we&#x27;re =
testing the second week. That one very specifically is because there&#x27;s=
 dependencies from. I think it&#x27;s items one through nine because =
it&#x27;s a more of a reporting function. So they don&#x27;t have Hyperion,=

one. They would. But just talking through that with the team because of all=
 the other testing going on, there is a very low likelihood to be able to =

these 14 core systems, there are all these adjacents that are being used =
where there&#x27;s no changes in brv, but they&#x27;re being consumed as =
part of the end to end testing and the prv. And so this is really more a =
status on do we have testers in this areas as well? Have we provisioned =
access and have we aligned on all the schedules? So again, for UAT schedule=

I&#x27;ll talk through this and then perhaps highlight here. So all this is=
 saying is again, there are script finalization ongoing in these two for =
UAT happening for these three, and they should be done by this weekend and =
Monday for the tax app Srinivas. These are the dates we discussed yesterday=
. So that&#x27;s one point in that. This tracks the number of scripts for =
each of these sub functional areas. This essentially tracks execution =
status as to how many this is again will be Provided at the end of day, =
every day on how many were planned, how many were actually completed, how =
many had got stopped due to defects or any other issues, how many are at =
risk of getting completed, and then what becomes what is delayed? The =
particular call outs here would be these three items which would get closed=
 for UAT by Monday. And then the second call out here is that to the point =
that Jessica mentioned, the HR ADP testing is being managed by adp. They =
have a rigorous process. ADP is managing the execution and reporting of it =
that Sandra and Kelly Rosen and others are plugged into. It&#x27;s not =
being tracked here. And so if that question comes up, we may want to =
understand if the expectation is everything to be tracked here.=
