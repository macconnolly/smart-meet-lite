# Meeting Summary =
=E2=80=93 June 20, 2025

## Attendees
- Rakesh
- Prashant
- Sakina
- Charles
- Lane
- Paul
- Rashid
- Bill
- Corey
- Mac
- Others as referenced: Sukai, Tom Moker, Mahesh, James, Mahim, Jeff, =
Angela, Sean, Skip Shoal

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. **Project Planning & Structured Deliverables**
- **Need for Structured Timetable:** There is consensus on reviving a =
detailed, step-by-step project timetable, reminiscent of efforts two to =
three months ago. The focus is on providing a clear look-ahead, tactical =
T-minus planning, and early identification of activities and deliverables =
between now and October.
- **Advance Preparation:** Sukai requested not to =
receive last-minute notices and prefers all significant deliverables to be =
shared well ahead of time=E2=80=94especially those requiring review or =
communication to the broader program.
- **Review Cycles:** There will be =
built-in review cycles with both Paul and Sukai for all key deliverables. =
Recent lapses (e.g., the BRV readiness workshop) underscored the need for =
timely alignment.
- **Game-planning & Rigorous Tracking:** Each "big rock" =
or major deliverable will be mapped out in detail, with owners coming =
prepared to report status, delays, risks, and escalation needs.
- **Tactical Planning:** Next week, a session will be held to define =
granular plans for each high-impact deliverable.

#### Key Points:
- All tower leads and functional owners to draft their tactical plans, =
which will be iteratively refined as a team.
- Weekly structured reviews =
and escalations are to replace ad hoc reporting.

---

### 2. **Staffing and Resource Onboarding**
- **App Factory Staffing:** =
Discussions continue on staffing for the App Factory work stream. Charles =
to discuss with Prashant about onboarding cross-functional resources.
- **Resource Onboarding:** Director Tom Moker is being considered for =
onboarding, with Sakina tasked to coordinate and complete initial =
independence checks.

#### Key Points:
- Proposal and staffing approach for=
 App Factory is with all tower leads; reactions are awaited.
- Expectation to begin onboarding people next week, pending conversations =
with Paul.
- Multiple work streams, including app factory, unstructured =
data, and end-user migration, will require increased resources.

---

### 3. **Server & Site Migrations**
- **Edge Server Migration:** Rashid is =
to provide a server migration schedule identifying what apps are moving, =
especially aligned with site cutover plans.
- **Site Cutover Pilots:** =
Active pilot migrations are ongoing at two Pennsylvania sites; details (lid=
 codes and dates) will be provided.
- **Visibility & Communication:** =
Emphasized importance of informing app owners of their migration =
responsibilities and giving Sukai advance notice regarding these pilots and=
 changes.

#### Key Points:
- Server migrations are specifically for edge =
servers located at physical sites, not data centers.
- Communication plans involving IT Comms and Mahesh are necessary.
- Broader visibility for Sukai on pilots and potential risks are required.

---

### 4. **CSA Exit Workshop & TSA Exit Planning**
- **Workshop Preparation:** Lane updated that a detailed, hour-by-hour =
agenda for the upcoming two-day workshop was presented to Paul and team, =
and is aligned with expectations.
- **Contract Team Presentation:** The =
contracts team will prepare a 30-minute presentation on securing RTUs for =
day one to address access concerns.
- **EIT and Interdependency Input:** =
Paul will coordinate with various teams (EIT, DEPs, DCM) on budget and =
interdependency sessions; Lane will add to the All IT Connect agenda for =
Monday.
- **Material & Pre-read Preparation:** Rashid confirmed a pre-read =
for the Dex DCN workshop is ready, pending review with Bill and senior =
managers.

#### Key Points:
- Workshop readiness is high with over a week =
for final preparations.
- Several requests for support and data from =
internal functions in the coming week.
- Paul and Lane to coordinate on =
team inputs and presentations for upcoming sessions.

---

### 5. **Vendor & IT Strategy / Resource Funding**
- **Vendor Scope =
Alignment:** Discussion on aligning vendor IT strategy across all work =
streams before TSA exit. Certain managed service scopes were missed and =
will need to be handled via a new vendor or change request.
- **Resource Gap for DCN:** James (now out of office for two weeks) =
highlighted the absence of EY support for DCN and the need for advisory =
resources, especially for M&A-specific activities (e.g., Active Directory, =
device transitions).
- **Funding Constraints:** Expansion requests for =
resources from James and Mahim require alignment and funding approval. The =
SOW for Phase 4 is already under budget pressure, (i.e., additional =
headcount may require change requests and client negotiation).
- **Resource Commitments:** The team will avoid making firm commitments =
before funding and scope are clarified.

#### Key Points:
- Next step: Draft a holistic resourcing and funding plan for new requests;=
 to be discussed with Paul, Sukai, and upcoming CIO.
- All resource discussions to be scoped and documented for potential future=
 change requests.

---

### 6. **Program & Cost Tracking**
- **Budget Tracking:** Corey to provide an updated view of budget vs. =
actuals for presentation.
- **Workshop Status Updates:** Status heatmaps =
and pending actions (specifically for ERP and cloud deliverables) to be =
shared at All IT Connect.
- **UAT Progress:** SIT (System Integration =
Testing) is starting. Calendar, trackers, and dashboards for readiness and =
defect tracking will be developed and socialized, with daily morning and =
afternoon reporting from next week.

#### Key Points:
- UAT status updates and associated reporting mechanisms (defect tracker, =
execution dashboards) will be included in All NT Connect materials.
- ERP and cloud dependency information is pending (awaiting SAP negotiation=
 results).

---

### 7. **PC Rollout & Infrastructure Migration**
- **PC Rollout Schedule:** Rashid has received the schedule; now focusing =
on mapping risks and aligning sequences of user migrations.
- **Holistic Infrastructure Migration:** Emphasis on tracking risk across =
all infrastructure components (sites, servers, network, PCs, unstructured =
data), not in isolation.
- **Risk Reporting:** Any risks or sequencing =
issues to be flagged for Sukai and senior stakeholders.

#### Key Points:
- Risks specific to PC deployment and broader infrastructure migrations =
need to be monitored and communicated.

---

### 8. **Ownership and Risk =
Gaps: PowerApps & Power BI**
- **Responsibility Misalignment:** There is =
confusion regarding ownership of PowerApps and Power BI migration. Data & =
Analytics vs. other teams (Maheen/Paul) have conflicting understandings.
- **Action:** Rashid to review project emails and clarify past resolutions;=
 both areas will need to align with the M365 migration schedule and be =
clearly assigned.

#### Key Points:
- Ensuring clear assignment of owners =
for these tools is critical, due to the scale of work and impact.

---

### 9. **Internal & Cross-Team Communication**
- **Unscheduled/Undocumented=
 Meetings:** An internal daily sync exists with Paul and Solstice team =
leads (not on broader team calendars, nor including EY).
- **Awareness:** Bill and Lane participated in the review of the TSA exit =
workshop agenda; teams to be made aware if their attendance is specially =
required.

---

### 10. **Hypercare and Command Center Strategy**
- **Upcoming Meeting:** A Hypercare meeting is scheduled for 2:30 Eastern; =
slides to be sent by Rajiv for pre-review.
- **Ownership Misalignment =
within DCN:** Aaron Hicks claims scope ownership for Hypercare, while =
others disagree. Need for consensus on roles before proceeding.

---

Transcript:
0:00
Through just step by step, not just this, but when we come in, it's not =
just, you know, what happened today. What it is, I think we would like to =
have a structured timetable of steps so somewhat similar to what we were =
doing a couple of months ago, two, three months ago. But we want to bring =
it back to the point where it's, we have a look ahead that you know, if =
we're working towards the BRV ready us, you know that there are a few =
workshops coming, there are things kicking off. So we do a T minus plan and=
 we understand what the activities are. And one of the primary reasons has =
been as well that Sukai pinged us and told us that she doesn't much =
appreciate last minute notices. So particularly where it comes to providing=
 her and Paul with any deliverables or anything that they need to be read =
into and read out to the broader program. They would like time ahead to =
prepare that with us. So the only, probably the most likely way we can do =
that is if we game plan each of the key mile deliverables that's coming out=
. So all of the big rocks activities that are going to be coming up between=
 now and October, we should lay that out including all the deliverables and=
 have a tactical plan to do what we will day on day or week on week so that=
 we understand and also bake in time for review with Paul and her before. =
So again a couple of recent examples, you know, the BRB readiness workshop =
has been, you know, just a fire drill mode. We submitted it but you know, =
Paul has been aware and he read into it somewhat and we're having the =
review with him. We've not had that review with Sukai and I think she'd =
made the point that you know, on two things. One, if there are urgencies =
and if there are risks, she would like to know ahead of time that we bring =
it up to her. But two and two that we read in, read her in into these, any =
deliverables or anything's coming up from.

2:06
Or.

2:07
Any other deliverable ahead of time. So we take that in, you know, into =
consideration. So the point I'm trying to make here is that next week we'll=
 spend some time just talking through as we lay out for each of these key =
key big ticket items how we want to game plan that and a very tactical game=
 plan. Okay, there's gig five deliverable. This is again it's not new. It's=
 what we've done. We just need to do it with a bit more rigor. So we'll, =
we'll discuss that then. What that means for this call then is it won't be =
as much ad hoc. We'll have a structure, a bit more structure in place as to=
. We'll go through, you know, every step of it so that the right owner here=
 can come and provide a view into, you know, x has happened, Y has not =
happened. This is a delay. This is where I see the risk and this is what =
needs to be escalated. So let me stop there, see if Prashant, if you want =
to add anything and then get a reaction or a thoughts and comments from the=
 team, I.

3:14
Think you covered it. While we have a good, while we have a=
 structure of what we're doing, it's kind of become a little bit tactical. =
So just aligning it to what we are on the hook for and making sure that we =
have some review cycles, plan. That's the intent.

3:32
And keep in mind this list is as we go through this next phase, all of you =
saw the proposal. So if we get all of that work, including all this core =
stuff we're doing, there's going to be work on app factory, unstructured =
data, end user migration. So it's, it's different. Several more work =
streams that will be spun up and several more tactics, you know, somewhat =
independent deliverables and somewhat related. So we do need to get a good =
handle on that. So again, we'll talk through that more next week. But as =
you are working on your work streams here, think about, you know, =
tactically, my ask of our ask of all of you is, you know, where it is =
within your remit, you know, put together the initial view of the plan and =
we will also work with you to refine that. So the goal next week, end of an=
 activity or key item or body of work and talk through, you know, what is =
it we're going to be hitting in every day, every week so that we're =
marching to it with a bit more rigor. So having said that, let's get into =
it for this week certainly and into early next week. So I'll turn it over =
to you, Sakina.

4:48
Thank you Rakesh for starting us off. Yeah, so just =
starting with the move as is coordination by dcn. Charles, I know you were =
planning on chatting with Prashant. Any update on this area? Just generally=
 on staffing.

5:13
Sorry I was not on the one yesterday but I do see =
Charles to chat with Prashant GS staffing topics resources is that linked =
to move as his effort?

5:24
I don't think to do with like staffing. So we =
were discussing at Factory staffing and he said that he was wondering =
whether we could onboard resources that could help across he's and it.

5:37
Okay, so let's take that off of there Sakina in that case and put that=
 as a separate topic that we can discuss with her with Charles.

5:47
You said yes.

5:49
Okay. So yeah, I know. I'm aware of this and I need to =
get a conversation going with Charles.

5:55
We'll.

5:55
We'll do that move as is Good. We've got a potential resource.

6:02
For to.

6:03
Staff up App Factory. The proposal or our approach is out and=
 it's been shared with all of the tower leads. No one has reacted. I'm =
going to have a conversation with Paul and assume that we'll start getting =
people on the ground next week. Internally we've identified a director =
Sakina. I will reach out to you to onboard Tom Moker on the project. We've =
got confidence.

6:29
So.

6:32
Yeah, yeah, that is actually pretty nice. =
So I, I'll need to. I'll work with you Sagina to set up some time and, and =
do an onboarding and then of course we need to do all of the independent =
initial independence checks and whatnot. Right. So we'll just get those =
done.

6:50
Got it.

6:51
Yeah.

6:52
Yep, sounds good. Thank you for that.

6:58
Can you put us to keep an action item for me on this line item that I=
 owe Rakesh and Prashan the server migration schedule. This will show them =
what apps are moving, at least the line in the sand from dcn. So I need to =
get that over to them today.

7:19
Thanks, Rashid.

7:20
Rashid, I know you talked about this, but when you say server migration =
schedule, it is. So apps are moving and they have some plans already. Right=
, so what servers are these?

7:36
Yeah, this is specific to the edge =
server. So these are applications that are hosted at the site. So we're =
following.

7:45
I think.

7:45
Yeah, we're cutting over the network and so=
 the app owners need to be aware of all the work they need to be doing per =
the schedule.

7:53
So does this link to the site migration schedule then? =
Or are these servers sitting on data centers or are these sitting on site?

8:01
No, they're sitting on site.

8:03
So they're sitting on site, then =
they're part. So basically what you're saying is that there is a site =
cutover schedule that has been published and then the server migration of =
these edge systems will be aligned to align to that site move, Right?

8:18
That's right. That's a better way to say it.

8:22
Okay, so which site is =
moving immediately? Like. Like right now I know the.

8:30
There's two sites that are being piloted in Pennsylvania. That but let me =
not speak offhand, let me get to the actual lid codes and the dates on when=
 they're moving. And it also includes the applications that are being =
hosted on that site at that site.

8:47
So that would be good because. So =
for various reasons, Rashid, I think us as a team, we all need to know but =
I think if there's any communication that needs to go out as it relates to =
this and the pilot, it's something that we need to talk to Mahesh about, =
including the IT comms, etc. I don't doubt that that's probably already in =
their minds and that team's communicating but it'd be good visibility for =
us that we bring in. So these are things like that as a good example team =
and Rashid that we would want Sukai to know that there is a pilot happening=
 here and that this is things that she needs to know in terms of look out =
for this or watch out for this or heads up that these are things coming. So=
 yeah, just to publicize that with us, send it to the team so that we can =
review and if there's any actioning that we need to do as a team, let's =
talk through that so that we can make sure Paul and Sukai are up to date on=
 that.

9:50
Sure, let's do that. I think most important is making the app =
owners aware of what work they need to do by when. I think that's the big =
piece of it. So we can, when I share it with you, I say we have that =
conversation at least something today.

10:05
Let's do that. We should, we =
should. And I think you have something later in the day so you have the =
content review but perhaps after that.

10:12
Sure, we'll do okay.

10:15
All right, thank you both. Lane, anything on the teasing? Is the workshop =
after a meeting earlier?

10:23
Yeah, so I'll update this meeting. So Bill =
and I met with Paul and the leads this morning. We walked them through our =
outcomes and agenda for the two day workshop. Kind of very detailed I would=
 say hour by hour, what we're doing, no updates. I they're aligned with =
what we want to accomplish accomplish in the way that we're going about =
doing that. I will say that there will be a few asks of the team coming =
through today and into next week. So specifically for the contracts team, =
we will be asking for you guys to put together probably a 30 minute =
presentation of how your going about getting RTUs prior to day one. And =
it's really just going to meant to alleviate any concerns on access and =
right to Use those during the interim period for some other work streams. =
We'll have some masks coming out over the next few days, but I would say in=
 general for the workshop we're in very good shape and we have have, you =
know, over a week to get ready for it, which is puts us in a very good spot=
.

11:47
Thank you, Lane. And I know Paul mentioned an all IT connect =
agenda item on the CSA exit workshop.

11:55
So Paul and I are going to =
meet a little bit later today and that's really just to get awareness to =
his teams on where he needs some folks to plug in briefly during this. So =
you can think about that as pulling in the EIT team when we'll go through =
our budgets because there's obviously going to be some resource needs and =
EIT input that are needed for that session as well as DEPs and DCM for some=
 of the interdependency sessions because their input will be needed.

12:33
Sounds good. And I'll add that to the all IT connect agenda for Monday. =
Rashid for the Dex DC and he's workshop we on track to share the pre read.

12:47
And I've got a meeting scheduled with the senior managers partners =
later this afternoon to go over it in detail. Just a few missing pieces =
from slideware that I'm tracking so I think we're in good shape here.

13:01
And has it been reviewed with Bill?

13:06
Yeah, I gave him a preview=
 yesterday night so he's seen some of the slides and then we've got a =
detailed page flip this afternoon.

13:19
Okay.

13:22
Would like to chat about the third bullet on the updates though about the =
James request. He's going out of office I think for like two weeks. We've =
got some time here but would like to maybe next week. Rakesh and Prashant, =
while I'm in in Lane, while we're in Charlotte, we chat about this box on =
how we move forward.

13:42
Okay. And Charles and that team would also be =
there. Right. Cyber. So I'm hoping we can have that conversation with =
Charles as well.

13:51
Yeah, we would need Charles, Sean and probably Bill=
 for that discussion.

13:58
I think we talked already. Sorry, go ahead.

14:01
Sorry. This is part of the vendor ID strategy. Right. So one, there =
was a partial scope for managed services that has already been de auctioned=
. James has come back. Lena saw the mail that Rashid you forwarded that =
there are pieces that are missed out that need to now be, you know, sent =
out and packaged and sent out for another vendor to be onboarded. Right. =
And that is that ideally it needs to get also mixed with the app vendor =
strategy that they need to push forward. So I know James doesn't ask, but I=
 think we need to get Paul and others to look at this for holistically and =
like come up with a plan. We did have a session on vendor IT strategy =
already with, with that, with that group. So like it would be difficult for=
 us to kind of pick this up and do like an entire pre auction that scope of=
 work for what, what James needs. Right. But this is probably a quick =
change request or something that needs to come up.

15:05
So. So yeah, there's two points here. So one is the vendor and IT strategy =
really needs to be aligned across all work streams going into the TSA exit =
workshop because that is going to impact budgets as well as timelines and =
who they're planning on supporting their TSAXA projects. The second piece =
of this is James kind of what James highlighted in his ask is that DCN =
really doesn't have some EY support at all and he needs an advisor to come =
in and support him across some of the paper ops that he didn't even mention=
 because he doesn't likely doesn't even know that they're going to hit =
because they're not BAU things, they're M and A specific things. So you can=
 think about that like Active Directory and domain separation. Some of the =
EUC and device transition that are going to be very different than what he =
would typically see in his day to day job, especially just given his =
background. So I think what will likely happen is they'll probably want the=
 position and advisors come in, start helping him through that and then =
hope and then try to turn that into additional work for our team. So I =
think Skip Shoal was the name that I've heard.

16:32
Yeah, yeah, I hear you and all of this is good. We should discuss this =
further and scope it out. The one point is that who's going to fund it =
right now, right. There's already a, you know, an SOW that we are =
submitting overall. So for phase four, which already has a scope extension =
across certain areas that include end user migration, additional day one =
support for erp, this whole app factory piece. So we know that the client =
is under pressure to reduce consultant requirements. So while we capture =
all of it and create a view for James, it needs like we need to work with =
him to kind of get this to Paul, to Sukai, to the new CIO who comes in and =
then kind of agree on where the funds will come from for this. And he's not=
 the only one. Mahim has separately reached out for and asked for two to =
three resources that We've again not put into the sow, so I understand that=
 we need to scope it well but I don't want us to go and make any =
commitments saying oh we'll get you people because.

17:46
No, absolutely, yeah. To me this seems like something that would be a =
change request and additional opportunity.

17:53
Yeah, absolutely. And not=
 an immediate one in my understanding. I don't know Rakesh on the ground =
but like we're going to have to also depend our current scope that we're =
proposing pretty you know, significantly to like the tower leaders, Angela =
M and A teams and so on in the next couple of weeks.

18:19
Yeah, so yeah, so yeah, just action items there for us. But yes, I'm with =
you.

18:27
Sounds good. Also just something to flag is that James is =
already on vacation as of this morning. He was not on our solstice lead =
call in case the team was trying to set up any time with him. Moving on to =
all IT connect topics on this subject. Currently we have our topic for Paul=
 to address the EIT support for the TSA exit workshop. Lane, is there =
anything additional that needs to be presented for the TSA exit workshop?

18:57
No, nothing. At least three for sure.

19:00
Perfect. And then Corey,=
 is there any costing data that you would like to socialize?

19:11
I think we, we decided on showing.

19:13
A view of the.

19:14
The budget. Budget versus actual unique. So we'll get, we'll get an updated=
 view of that.

19:20
Okay.

19:23
And Rakesh, I don't know what you =
thought, what you think about, you know, I don't know if there's anything =
to show in the OIT connect or remind some folks on. But we can, it might =
not, we may not need to have like a slot for the gate deliverables or just,=
 we can just mention that those are due or you know, getting submitted. I =
think we have most of the inputs and I mean I need to address that broadly =
with the whole team.

19:52
Okay.

19:53
Yeah, it may be just enough. Do we=
 need. Are we requesting any information from that?

20:03
You know, I think the requests are out there. I think for ERP it's just =
getting.

20:07
Getting back information based on SAP negotiations which, =
which I think we don't have yet.

20:14
And, and then for cloud.

20:18
Information on those applications.

20:20
So let's include a slide on =
status update that essentially has your heat map but essentially I would =
expect everything else to be closed out and just these two for standalone =
costs, the particular sections.

20:40
And then Corey, I'll just await the =
data from you. Thank you. And then Matt, is there something to share for =
UAT on Monday? Is there anything we want to socialize Mac, Rakesh.

20:59
For UAT Sit is starting so I think it's. We'd want to socialize the =
calendar that's been put together that will develop by end of the day. So =
that will. Yeah. So there'll be a couple of things that will socialize a =
calendar, we'll socialize the trackers and we'll also socialize the =
dashboard that we're starting to maintain. So there will be a morning and =
an afternoon reporting that goes out and a cadence set up. So a daily scrum=
 call, etc. Being set up from Monday. So it'll be more of a morning evening=
 update. So we can. We should add a slide there for what the dashboard =
reporting and tracking would look like as well as potentially a defect =
tracker. So add that as well. So status execution status tracking readiness=
 and execution status and then defect management.

22:00
Okay, so the defect management Rick has just like your set one, set two set=
 three defects.

22:10
Yes.

22:13
Mac, let's align on this content so we =
have it in by Monday in the slides for the all NT connect. Moving on to =
staffing. Prashant, I know you are planning to discuss this with Charles, =
so I'm just going to park for now until we have an update and then. Rashid,=
 were you able to get the PC rollout schedule?

22:38
I received it about 1:00 clock yesterday.

22:42
Okay. And so for this item=
, what are we tracking currently?

22:49
To me I'd close this out. We've =
got the schedule and now it's just designing and aligning on user migration=
 schedules which we were tracking I think on the right. No, we're not =
actually. We took that one off.

23:02
So track it here, socialize that. =
Help us understand what could be potential risk, what may need to be =
sequenced, etc. But let's track it here again this goes back to the. My =
first thing statement refer for.

23:23
Yeah, for Sukai.

23:24
Yeah.

23:24
To me it's a broader. Like how is infrastructure migrating everything=
 including you know, just sites, servers, network PCs, unstructured data. =
Like it's all one thing. But agreed, we'll. We'll outline those risks =
specific to PCs.

23:42
All right, thanks Rashid. Moving on to BRV =
readiness, I've got.

23:48
One risk that I want to raise here on the left =
side of the PMO and catcher word. So Rashid, I know that you have said that=
 Power Apps and Power BI are covered by the data and analytics team. I was =
just on a call with Paul and the leads and Maheen specifically said believe=
 that Power Apps and Power BI are covered by. So there is a misalignment =
and A gap there where that no one is picking this up.

24:27
Let me, let me do some digging on my end because PowerApp came up early in =
the project and I know it got resolved somehow. So let me just go through =
those emails. I'm sure it's somewhere in there in.

24:39
Power BI is probably the bigger piece but those will both need to follow =
the M365 migration schedule. It's specific being specifically called out in=
 scope for aui. So we just need to understand who owns that because it is a=
 large piece of work for shiny. Edgar.

25:08
Hey, I've heard a couple of =
times today about some meeting with Paul and the Solstice team leads. I. =
I'm not sure is this a recurring thing? I've not seen anything on the cat.

25:18
Yeah, I've not. I haven't seen anything on my calendar.

25:21
I just want to be sure.

25:24
Specifically pulled into that for us to =
present for 30 minutes. They have an hour long meeting every day that's =
internal to them that they asked us to join to take them through the TSA =
exit workshop agenda.

25:39
Just keep us informed of that.

25:41
Interesting. So who's setting this up? Paul has set up a meeting. But EY is=
 not on that meeting, right?

25:50
No, ENY is not on that call. It's their=
 internal daily sync and he asked Bill and I to be on it last night so that=
 we could take him through the agenda we joined this morning and walk them =
through the TSAX workshop.

26:06
Okay. All right, that is good to know. I =
did not know that this meeting existed. All right.

26:14
Rashid, do you have your hand out?

26:16
Yeah, just quickly because I've =
got a drop. Prashant, Raquette, do you feel comfortable with the hypercare =
meeting? You guys are able to join. No more talking points. Do you want to =
see slides in advance?

26:25
I will be on Rajiv, if you can send me the =
slides in advance because I also need to then work with. I mean between you=
, me and Paul will need to work with the deal PMO team to to kind of align =
on. On the overall Hypercare command center strategy. Right. So that's =
going to be run centrally and IT command center will kind of be a big =
participant of that. Right. So we need to kind of tie out with that.

26:53
That works just 30 seconds. D.C. there's misalignment within DCN. You know =
Aaron Hicks thinks absolutely. This is in my scope. I own this. Okay. And =
Haritha, you saw their emails. They said absolutely not. It's not in our =
scope. And this is on Rachel. So that's the kind of the first let's make =
sure everyone's on the same page on who's doing what and then yeah, we can =
go through the content.

27:14
Okay. This is the one at 2:30 Eastern.

27:18
I believe so.

27:20
Okay.

27:25
If you want to prioritize UAT and =
other areas, I, I will commit to joining that one.

27:30
Okay. It's related to. Yeah, fair enough.

27:35
Moving on to BRV actually =
before we close out, I know we're overtime but. General update on this Mac.

27:47
Yeah. For the workshop tomorrow. We met with Paul. We've shared the =
data with him. He's walked through it. He's largely aligned to the, to what=
 we're putting in. He wants to go through the double clicks in more detail =
and he wants to follow up with a couple of people to update the content. So=
 between the Monday morning sync is we'll have to just plan on having this =
as a topic that we, we walk her through it. I know she has some planned =
time off or whatever or she's traveling somewhere else next Monday. So I, I=
 do need to work with you to get that 15 minutes with her. Walk her through=
 the BRB agenda.

28:30
Okay. So we, we have a, we have a connect later =
today on it. So let's talk during that time.

28:36
Yeah, thank you.

28:43
And sorry on the other one the. Thank you. Arpit Prashant for and the rest =
of the team, Sakina, everyone else for the content. Sukai is on board with =
the content. She had some nets this morning and we have some talking points=
. We're meeting with Jeff and a few and then we'll let you know how things =
go. But I think. Yeah, we're. We're providing an update on UAT to Jeff in a=
 little while.

29:13
I'm not on that meeting. Rakesh, I don't want.

29:16
Yeah, no, no, you're good.

29:20
Let me.

29:22
Sure. All right.

29:28
Anything that we need to discuss Now I know we are over time and we have =
conflicting meetings after but we can pick back up at eod.

29:39
Sounds good. It.

 step, not just this, but when we come in, it&#x27;s not just, you know, =
what happened today. What it is, I think we would like to have a structured=
 timetable of steps so somewhat similar to what we were doing a couple of =
months ago, two, three months ago. But we want to bring it back to the =
point where it&#x27;s, we have a look ahead that you know, if we&#x27;re =
working towards the BRV ready us, you know that there are a few workshops =
coming, there are things kicking off. So we do a T minus plan and we =
understand what the activities are. And one of the primary reasons has been=
 as well that Sukai pinged us and told us that she doesn&#x27;t much =
appreciate last minute notices. So particularly where it comes to providing=
 her and Paul with any deliverables or anything that they need to be read =
into and read out to the broader program. They would like time ahead to =
prepare that with us. So the only, probably the most likely way we can do =
that is if we game plan each of the key mile deliverables that&#x27;s =
coming out. So all of the big rocks activities that are going to be coming =
up between now and October, we should lay that out including all the =
deliverables and have a tactical plan to do what we will day on day or week=
 on week so that we understand and also bake in time for review with Paul =
and her before. So again a couple of recent examples, you know, the BRB =
readiness workshop has been, you know, just a fire drill mode. We submitted=
 it but you know, Paul has been aware and he read into it somewhat and =
we&#x27;re having the review with him. We&#x27;ve not had that review with =
Sukai and I think she&#x27;d made the point that you know, on two things. =
One, if there are urgencies and if there are risks, she would like to know =
ahead of time that we bring it up to her. But two and two that we read in, =
read her in into these, any deliverables or anything&#x27;s coming up from.=

tactical game plan. Okay, there&#x27;s gig five deliverable. This is again =
it&#x27;s not new. It&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve done. We just need to do it =
with a bit more rigor. So we&#x27;ll, we&#x27;ll discuss that then. What =
that means for this call then is it won&#x27;t be as much ad hoc. =
We&#x27;ll have a structure, a bit more structure in place as to. =
We&#x27;ll go through, you know, every step of it so that the right owner =
here can come and provide a view into, you know, x has happened, Y has not =
happened. This is a delay. This is where I see the risk and this is what =
needs to be escalated. So let me stop there, see if Prashant, if you want =

 out as it relates to this and the pilot, it&#x27;s something that we need =
to talk to Mahesh about, including the IT comms, etc. I don&#x27;t doubt =
that that&#x27;s probably already in their minds and that team&#x27;s =
communicating but it&#x27;d be good visibility for us that we bring in. So =
these are things like that as a good example team and Rashid that we would =
want Sukai to know that there is a pilot happening here and that this is =
things that she needs to know in terms of look out for this or watch out =
for this or heads up that these are things coming. So yeah, just to =
publicize that with us, send it to the team so that we can review and if =
there&#x27;s any actioning that we need to do as a team, let&#x27;s talk =

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Sorry. This is part =
of the vendor ID strategy. Right. So one, there was a partial scope for =
managed services that has already been de auctioned. James has come back. =
Lena saw the mail that Rashid you forwarded that there are pieces that are =
missed out that need to now be, you know, sent out and packaged and sent =
out for another vendor to be onboarded. Right. And that is that ideally it =
needs to get also mixed with the app vendor strategy that they need to push=
 forward. So I know James doesn&#x27;t ask, but I think we need to get Paul=
 and others to look at this for holistically and like come up with a plan. =
We did have a session on vendor IT strategy already with, with that, with =
that group. So like it would be difficult for us to kind of pick this up =
and do like an entire pre auction that scope of work for what, what James =
needs. Right. But this is probably a quick change request or something that=
 needs to come up.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px=

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">So. So yeah, =
there&#x27;s two points here. So one is the vendor and IT strategy really =
needs to be aligned across all work streams going into the TSA exit =
workshop because that is going to impact budgets as well as timelines and =
who they&#x27;re planning on supporting their TSAXA projects. The second =
piece of this is James kind of what James highlighted in his ask is that =
DCN really doesn&#x27;t have some EY support at all and he needs an advisor=
 to come in and support him across some of the paper ops that he =
didn&#x27;t even mention because he doesn&#x27;t likely doesn&#x27;t even =
know that they&#x27;re going to hit because they&#x27;re not BAU things, =
they&#x27;re M and A specific things. So you can think about that like =
Active Directory and domain separation. Some of the EUC and device =
transition that are going to be very different than what he would typically=
 see in his day to day job, especially just given his background. So I =
think what will likely happen is they&#x27;ll probably want the position =
and advisors come in, start helping him through that and then hope and then=
 try to turn that into additional work for our team. So I think Skip Shoal =
was the name that I&#x27;ve heard.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:1=

 you and all of this is good. We should discuss this further and scope it =

There&#x27;s already a, you know, an SOW that we are submitting overall. So=
 for phase four, which already has a scope extension across certain areas =
that include end user migration, additional day one support for erp, this =
whole app factory piece. So we know that the client is under pressure to =
reduce consultant requirements. So while we capture all of it and create a =
view for James, it needs like we need to work with him to kind of get this =
to Paul, to Sukai, to the new CIO who comes in and then kind of agree on =
where the funds will come from for this. And he&#x27;s not the only one. =
Mahim has separately reached out for and asked for two to three resources =
that We&#x27;ve again not put into the sow, so I understand that we need to=
