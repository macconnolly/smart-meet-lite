UAT Readiness Accountability and Coordination Plan

# Meeting Summary: UAT Readiness Review and Coordination =20
**Date:** June 2, 2025 =20
**Attendees:** Rakesh, Pierce, Avinash, and =
others referenced (Jeff, Sky, Sukhai, Sriram, Harry Tong, John, Steve Brown=
, Pramod, etc.) =20
**Purpose:** Immediate review and action planning for =
the upcoming UAT phase, readiness dashboard, identifying gaps, and defining=
 clear next steps ahead of the All IT call.

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. **Status of UAT Readiness and Current Deliverables**
- **Objective:** Move from presentation/preparation phase to actionable =
execution.
- **Discussion Points:**
  - Review of the readiness =
presentation and feedback that leadership now needs actual execution, not =
further discussion or deck reviews.
  - Specific concern expressed about =
overdue deliverables; names and responsibilities for UAT roles were due on =
May 23 and remain incomplete by June 2.
  - Emphasis on accountability: If =
deliverables aren=E2=80=99t provided, issues will be escalated directly to =
leadership (Jeff, Sky) as no further extensions are possible.

### 2. **Review of UAT Tracker and Dashboard**
- **Objective:** Ensure =
completeness and usability of the tracker and readiness dashboard.
- **Discussion Points:**
  - Excel tracker contains a roster of UAT =
functional coordinators, POCs, and IT leads, but contains =
gaps=E2=80=94especially among IT support roles for various subfunctions.
  - Calls for the inclusion of a more granular breakdown, such as specific =
IT resource names under each subfunction (e.g., Finance=E2=80=99s =
transaction flow, T&E cards, etc.).
  - Heat map/dashboard visualizations =
were discussed; current versions insufficient since they do not reflect =
full subfunction coverage.

### 3. **Alignment and Role Clarifications**
- **Objective:** Identify points of contact and ensure all subfunctions =
have clear owners.
- **Discussion Points:**
  - Need to clarify if some =
business focal points are also acting as IT focal points and identify =
missing names in key areas (e.g., ISC, supply chain, finance).
  - Discussion of the need for explicit callouts in the tracker for blank =
roles and missing points of contact.
  - Suggestions to add further columns=
 such as =E2=80=9Csubfunction IT POC=E2=80=9D for better clarity and =
escalation.

### 4. **Immediate Actions and Communication**
- **Objective:** Mobilize required teams to populate tracker and identify =
testing windows.
- **Discussion Points:**
  - Decision to email all =
responsible parties with a link to the tracker, explicit instructions, and =
an end-of-day deadline for completion.
  - If no response, escalation =
protocol will be enacted.
  - Ensured tracker is accessible (renamed to =
"UAT Readiness Tracker" with no dates for version consistency), and link =
will be distributed via chat and email.
  - Emphasis on a single-threaded =
approach to communications to avoid confusion among multiple leadership and=
 teams.

### 5. **Calendar and Testing Windows Coordination**
- **Objective:** Gather and align SIT/UAT windows for all workstreams and =
functions.
- **Discussion Points:**
  - Recognition that several teams (ERP=
, supply chain) have set windows for SIT and UAT, but this information is =
fragmented and not formally collected.
  - Need for MOS (meetings of =
status) calendaring to bridge the gaps and clarify dependencies between =
functions (e.g., ERP, finance, supply chain).
  - Plan to ask for explicit =
SIT/UAT dates via formal requests as previous calls did not yield =
structured data.

### 6. **Dashboard and Reporting Evolution**
- **Objective:** Develop a live dashboard to communicate readiness and =
outstanding gaps.
- **Discussion Points:**
  - After roster completion, =
focus will shift to a dashboard for executive visibility; key columns to =
include: names identified, business/IT alignment, SIT/UAT status.
  - Plan to develop this dashboard for review by midweek (target: Wednesday=
, June 4).

---

## Action Items

1. **Immediate Completion of UAT Roster**
   - All subfunction IT and business contacts must update the UAT Readiness=
 Tracker with named owners by *end of day today*, June 2, 2025.
   - Deadline is final; escalation to leadership will occur for any =
continued gaps.
   - Pierce will send the tracker link via chat; official =
communication will go out to all responsible parties.

2. **Renaming of Current Tracker**
   - Sheet to be renamed "UAT Readiness =
Tracker" (no date references) for clarity and currency.

3. **Template/Tracker Finalization**
   - Avinash to review the sheet for =
missing areas, formatting issues, and required columns for POCs.
   - Additional column to be added for subfunction IT POCs (where =
applicable).

4. **Request for Testing Dates**
   - Formal email to be sent=
 requesting each function/team to provide specific SIT/UAT dates for their =
workstreams.
   - Collect all available dates for SIT/UAT and publish in =
tracker, using placeholders where necessary.

5. **MOS Calendar =
Scheduling**
   - Avinash to assist in scheduling alignment calls (MOS) =
with all workstream leads to clarify testing windows and close any gaps.

6. **Dashboard Development**
   - Begin development of readiness dashboard =
after roster completion.
   - Pierce and Avinash to review and refine =
dashboard by Wednesday, June 4.

---

## Follow-Up Points and Upcoming =
Meetings

- **All IT Connect Call:** Tracker and action points to be =
communicated within the next 20 minutes during the broader All IT call.
- **Internal Reviews:** Dashboard for UAT readiness to be reviewed =
internally by Wednesday, June 4, with iterations as required.
- **Further Email Communications:** Subsequent reminder/follow-up emails to=
 be sent if teams do not provide SIT/UAT dates after initial requests.
- **Regular MOS Alignment Meetings:** To be calendarized throughout the =
week to match functional and IT readiness.

---

## Key Risks and Gaps =
Highlighted

- **Ownership Gaps:** Several subfunctions lack clearly named =
IT/business leads or points of contact.
- **Data/Status Gaps:** Lack of =
formal collection of SIT/UAT windows across teams; prior requests largely =
informal or incomplete.
- **Accountability:** Multiple teams have had two =
weeks to provide information; further delays will impact UAT schedule =
(starts in 8 days).

---

## Summary Statement

The meeting focused on =
shifting from preparation to execution for UAT readiness, establishing =
accountability for unresolved gaps, accelerating completion of UAT rosters =
(names and POCs), and initiating immediate coordination to gather all =
required SIT/UAT windows. A critical deadline of end-of-day June 2 is set =
for these deliverables, leveraging escalation where required, with further =
internal tracking and executive dashboarding to follow. Regular alignment =
and follow-up meetings will ensure remaining issues are resolved ahead of =
UAT commencement.

Transcript:
0:00
Yeah, sure is. Hey, Rakesh. So I think =
we just wanted to set up some time to talk through. I know that we haven't =
personally had the opportunity to debrief after the call on Friday, but I =
think the pressing matter is a review for the all IT call. UAT readiness is=
 up on the agenda. Just an overall view of what we're putting together and =
then what are the gaps and the risks and the immediate actions. Like what, =
what do we need from folks this week and what are we working on? And we =
wanted to review this with you before we put it in front of that audience =
and then hopefully, if we have time, talk about actions for the week, =
things where, where our priorities are at. Really.

0:52
Yeah.

0:52
And I did want to talk to this because. So here's my $0.02 on it and I'm =
gonna be pretty blunt on here just so that we're on the same page for it. =
The presentation and what we have going on is great. It's right where we =
need to hit it. To me, Rakesh spoke on this earlier last week. Everything =
that we have lined up is exactly where we needed to go. But now we need to =
take it from doing a PowerPoint presentation to we have to do this now. So =
like the deck is the high level. It's great for leadership, but now we have=
 to get into it where that dashboard has to go through it, who owes me what=
? And that needs to go to Sky. So if we don't have a name, it's going to =
Sky Jeff today. Like we're out of time. There's no more deck, no more =
discussion on this thing. If someone owes us something, it's going to Jeff =
sky today saying, hey, they've had two weeks. Because Rakesh, I know some =
of those stuff they're supposed to have to list on 23rd.

1:46
23Rd, right?

1:47
Yeah. We're in June. We're, we're screwed. So it needs to get to that=
 point of, you know, we're going to talk about today on the call, but if =
you owe me something, it's going directly to your leadership now. And then =
what does it look like moving forward? Like the dashboard. You know, I know=
 we've talked about it and we showed a slide on it, but what does the =
dashboard actually look like? What is it live view for it to where we can =
actually show leadership for. Do we have that available?

2:14
Not this morning. We're mocking something up and we'll look to get it =
midweek.

2:22
So I think that's where like Jeff and Sky, they like where =
we're going. They like the direction, unfortunately, UAT starts in eight =
days.

2:31
Yeah, no, so. Yeah, no, fair, Fair enough. So I think there are=
 a couple of things. I think. So the other table there. Can you go to slide=
 3? So I think we have a bit of roster. So I think where we need to start =
filling up our stuff, Pierce, is we've got the names, every name that we've=
 gotten, we've put that in Excel. So if you go to the Excel, I think what =
we don't have is, yes, the name, some of the names starting with that, but =
the rest of the dashboarding that Sukhai was talking about on. I need to =
understand when KT is happening. I need to understand the people status. I =
need to understand when SIT is happening. That stuff will add it into a =
template here and very quickly do it today. I think the other piece, like =
all of these Excel. I think it's the other Excel you are sharing. Hey, =
Avinash. So we have some names. I think we need to start looking at what is=
 truly missing. And I was hoping we have that.

3:37
Yeah, let me. I'm just pulling that up right now.

3:39
Yep, yep, yep, yep. No worries.

3:41
Yeah, I agree, like I said, and =
seeing the names and seeing where our gaps are, but then we got to start =
putting the two and two, like, you know, now we have the Excel, now we need=
 to get this aligned for it. And Avinash, thanks for joining. That's where =
I'm gonna need some of your help to start bridging some of these gaps like =
ISC Tree and all them are starting to really start to message us and ask me=
 about the overall view on how we're going to look at this. And I think =
that's where that dashboard is going to come in handy of saying, okay, ERP =
is doing their testing right now for sip. Now we do, you know, UAT and it's=
 going to start what functions are aligned for it. Because ISC is =
incremental into multiple different work streams. So they're going to be =
touching base on it. But now we really got to start hitting the meat of =
coordination between everybody.

4:29
Yeah, so this is so two points here. =
So these are the names we've put and everything we've gotten from all of =
the sources is here. Avinash as well. So We've got the UAT functional =
coordinator names and POCs from each of the functions. There are some that =
are certainly ISC will have to understand if there is a business focal or =
if it's the same person like Laura is the same saying, well, I think you =
Gave a ccx but I think there was something for Sriram as well where he's =
given all these names and I think the other part of this is from an IT =
perspective is Pramod. So we need to get if there's additional IT person =
that is supporting sub function in here for Sriram like a CX or procurement=
 or logistics. So I think that's the next step here. But here's. This is =
really where we have all the gaps now we also have in the context of this, =
the other It's. If you go on up and this probably needs to. This table =
probably will need to change and modify a bit. Do we have stuff around IT =
who is. Okay, so we've got IT focal but we don't have a. An IT lead per se =
or like promote. If he's got certain people supporting him on. On supply =
chain sub functions, we don't have any of those. So I think this is where. =
So at this point this is the name. These are the names we have and all the =
names we've gotten, we've put it in here. I think we now need to start =
understanding what the gap is so that we can then start lighting these up. =
So Avinash, question for you. Are you able to follow this tracker?

6:23
Yes, I can take it a quick. I have not looked at it.

6:27
Okay. Because I want to make sure that our rows are right and you know =
where that's not applicable. We can populate those but I want to make sure =
that we're capturing the right rows and then the columns for each of these.=
 Then talk about the readiness. So okay, have you identified the names? =
Have you aligned with the IT function like Sriram has been asking for in =
the couple of meetings? Those are all the calendaring of the MOS peers that=
 we need to start doing. So Avinash, maybe we work with you to calendar =
these touch points. You know the case in point last week we had a very good=
. Go ahead sorry.

7:12
Put this Excel in front of all of our leads to say =
that hey, this is what they expect me to.

7:20
We're doing that this in =
the all it connect in another 30 minutes, 20 minutes.

7:25
Okay? Yeah, I think till we are not going to Congress, I don't think you'll=
 get anything spared out here.

7:31
Okay.

7:32
I think that's our first =
step to say hey, here is a special. The best that we know of right now. But=
 we would want you to populate all of this information. Once we have it =
populated, you can see where the gaps are.

7:46
So let's do this Mac, =
let's take this sheet and put this in a PowerPoint. And then we'll also =
send them the Honeywell link to this readiness. And then we should ask the =
ask the call to action slide should be, I need this populated by, you know,=
 end of day today. Yep. Because to Pierce's point, we're out of time.

8:12
Because that is that realistic, I think.

8:15
Well, you know, they've had =
two for two weeks. Yeah, yeah, but you know, they've had, I mean, well, to =
be fair, we've asked them for two weeks. They've not sent us anything. And =
if they're excuses, oh, we don't have a template to fill. Okay, we do have =
a template. So go fill. So we can at least give them till end of the day =
and tomorrow morning to go, you know, to sort this out.

8:40
So that's what I think we can do that, I think because we only have 20 =
minutes. I'm not sure where we're at in the agenda, but this heat map on =
the slide points to that. Oops, this is the wrong deck. But the heat map on=
 the slide that we have points to that. So these are mapped. We changed the=
 titles a minute ago. But these are mapped to where do we have gaps in the =
four columns in the Excel. So Op Zep, Lead Functional Coordinator, Business=
 focal, IT focal. This is mapped to these. And we could just make the call =
to action more clear. If you see red, go to this link and populate it.

9:27
Well, here's my other part. This is where I have and I don't know =
Piers, if this is. These are the four things we should track because for =
example, we have Harry Tong as the IT focal for Finance. He may have one or=
 two people he designates as leads and a focal for, you know, he's, he's =
probably, he's Athens IT focal now. So is there an equivalent Honeywell? I =
do not know. Does he, does he have a couple of people that will support the=
 sub functions in finance? I do not know. Those are the names we need. So =
right now I'm reading it as finances clean, but it's not because the Excel =
says differently. So that's why we need to change that Excel to Let's not, =
let's not show the dashboard. But we need the Excel here saying, Harry, go =
in and give me a name for each of these sub line items here. Who's doing =
the transaction flow? Who's doing the TNE cards? Is it one person across =
these? If so, put the name there. If not, give me the five names. That's =
what we need by End of.

10:35
Day in the same way that John sent us those =
first.

10:38
John and yeah, for ccex. Yeah. Or Sriram for supply chain. =
Yeah.

10:45
Okay.

10:47
I need to get really the ask. So copy this table =
in there and then we'll send them the link and call to action to say listen=
, this is all blank for it. This is an IT audience. We need you guys to =
give us all the names for it because then we will go back in and say, okay,=
 if it's an end to end process, we're going to get business testers. What =
about for some of these apps that are not BRB, like the 10 move as is apps =
and stuff. You know you're doing sit right now. Who are your testers for =
those as well? You know, who are your leads? You know, Harry's got a few =
apps that are non BRV that are going live. So what's he doing about them? =
So that's the other piece of it we need. So this dashboard is again, I =
think we need to adjust the dashboard so perhaps show this, show the first =
slide and then give the table at the second. And then the call to action is=
 they need this filled out today, no more. Because tomorrow, in fact, to =
Pierce's point, this needs to go out by end of day today to Jeff and others=
 and Sukai and say we've got gaps. So call really is guys, get on it, fill =
this names out. Perhaps that's step number one. And then immediately after =
we can then talk about what the dashboard for Friday should look like so =
that we can start developing. One of the columns is names identified. =
Another column is, you know, key, you know, business names identified and =
KT done alignment and done sit status, UAT status. So that dashboard we =
could develop right after for a review with peers on Wednesday. But I think=
 the call to action today is this is not done. Go fill this out. Actually, =
after Harry Tong, I would leave the other. You need to include the rows =
that are blank.

12:54
You've got 15 minutes here before your next call. =
Rakesh, you shoot out an email with the link for everyone and say, hey, =
here's the template. We'll discuss this in the call. But this is what we =
expect because if you're not going to put an email.

13:09
Yeah, if you're not going to put. Yeah, that's fine. So let me do that, let=
 me. Okay, so actually, you know what, it may be easier coming from you, =
Pierce. It may resonate better. So.

13:23
Would you, you have the link.

13:26
For this and I can send it out? Yes, Yep. I, we have max. Let's send =
The Honeywell link here.

13:31
Yeah, I'm going to drop it in the chat =
right now.

13:33
Okay.

13:34
Yeah, drop it in the chat and then what I'll=
 do is I'll put on email to the broader audience and let them know that I =
need, you know, everyone to confirm the existing names in here and fill in =
the blanks by end of day today.

13:47
Let's, and if you don't mind, let's =
rename the thing. Just call it UAT Ready. You know, UAT Roster. Let's not =
put a date on it.

13:59
Where.

14:03
It'S not UAT readiness tracker 527. =
Let's call it UAT readiness tracker. Just no date.

14:13
Okay. You have on the Excel.

14:19
Yes, on the Excel.

14:20
Yeah. Let me rename it.

14:21
Yeah. So we will ask of it from the teams at=
 one, we'll see where we are in parallel. We'll start developing the =
dashboard. That and again we'll, we'll look to send a read to you tomorrow,=
 if not before Wednesday, Pierce and Avinash. So that way we can at least =
refine that. We've got a few cycles to refine what we need and then we can =
see where the data flows in from the other part of all of this is. So the =
next piece of this, Avinash, is we need to have this calendar. What I'm =
realizing, for example, is in the calls from last week, supply chain Pramod=
 and his team shared when their sit is happening and for all their systems =
and some of the sits happening now and you know, UAT windows for them from =
a business perspective, Sriram and the business process teams are looking =
at a view of the calendar that they need to support testing in. What we =
also heard is the ERP team already has calendar windows that Srinivas and =
Srijib have. Bill Ponsetty have developed that they are reaching out and =
asking, excuse me, support for, for ERP testing for uat. So this is where =
the, the connect the dots and coordination that we need to do is to say, =
okay, I've got so many of these windows coming up. How do we show this end =
to end and how do we have this alignment with, between IT work streams and =
the functions to say, well, ERP is ready, the system is ready in these two =
windows. The supply chain systems are ready prior in these windows or they =
overlap, you know, finance is ready in a little bit later perhaps. So I =
think we need to do that marrying up so that we, we understand all the =
windows that each function, each work stream is ready. So you know, =
functions can go then plan the Scenarios and end to end scenarios and start=
 collaborating there. So that's against the, the next step on it. But I =
think that that's why these alignment calls are needed now. So we'll send =
you an MOS calendar. So if you can help calendar this with all the work =
streams throughout this week, then we can start, you know, developing, you =
know, talking points for each of these and understanding and closing the =
gaps.

16:56
Yeah. And Rakesh, just a quick question to backtrack real =
quick. Your to your comment about needing to include the blank rows. Could =
we add just another column that's like this is the default IT focal and =
names if, if they like for Harry Tong, if he wants to nominate like IT =
folks some delegate.

17:18
Yeah, yeah, include that column there. Include =
another column in here that says, you know, sub function or you know, sub =
function coordinator. POC it poc.

17:50
And that was these folks really I =
think like from that we got from John.

17:58
So Steve Brown may say I've =
got six people. So. So yeah, I know not to take up too much of this call. =
Anything else? Avinash or Pierce, I know we've talked this to death. Let's =
just put it to action. And Avinash, please take a look at the sheet as well=
. See what may be missing or how we can reformat the sheet. Sorry.

18:29
Do you have a sheet where you track the timelines that you're talking about=
? Have you created a new sheet?

18:37
Yeah, we do have. Yeah, yeah, yeah, =
we do. Yeah, we'll send that to you as well as in.

18:44
Is that not captured there in terms.

18:46
Of on the right hand side. So, =
so on the right hand side we need to fill in some dates here because like =
we need to schedule the itmos. We need to schedule when these scenarios are=
 aligned. We can put some placeholder dates. Maybe that's what we start =
with instead of T minus.

19:04
Rakesh, my question is have you asked the =
team, have they given you the dates? Have they put up dates right now or. =
We've not asked of that information as yet.

19:18
Some of it we've asked =
some of it. No. So that's the other piece is we can ask on the call today =
and formalize it. So to Pierce's point earlier point we've asked them =
during these meetings and such, but it's not been like a formal email, give=
 me this date. So I think that's what is needed as well.

19:37
Yeah, calls are not something, yes, it's important. But then without having=
 sent out templates or emails to be focused and saying that this is what I =
need from you in this template, we are not going to get it. There are so =
many things that are happening. The calls can reinforce that messaging =
saying that we've sent this out, we've not heard back. We're going to =
escalate this.

19:58
We'll send it. Yeah. So we'll do that and then send =
out the template as well.

20:02
Yeah, I have an email that's going to go =
out right now that's to all the points, just talking about this. And I =
basically took some of our normal. James, Howita, Yonji, you know, Avinash,=
 you're on here. But then I also took all the names off of this list right =
here. I took Harry off here, took three and threw all them on the email. =
And then I'm gonna ask them to make sure I don't miss anybody and tell them=
 they have something today, today, and then they're gonna have to get it =
through it. Yeah, I could probably give them till tomorrow morning. But =
like I said, it's just. Just a name at this stage. And they've been =
discussed on it with. It connects with Sakai directly. Chris has brought it=
 up. So I think we're at the stage now where they should have this.

20:42
Yeah. And then we'll follow up. Avinash, your point with another email that=
 says provide the test dates and the windows you've already defined in here=
 in the same template. So we'll, we'll do that.

20:53
So that way you're able to generate an overall overall and whoever is =
running that MOS with the business portals or in any conversation, you have=
 one access workflow to say, here are the names, here are the dates that we=
 are looking at when SID is happening for which function, when UAT is going=
 to kick in for which function. So it's an easy conversation.

21:19
Question for you. Is there a ready made will create something. We'll put =
that together. Is there something that Honeywell typically uses?

21:30
There's nothing typical.

21:32
Okay, all right. Or something you've used. =
Okay. Just not nothing format. Okay. All right, so we'll just use an.

21:39
Excel Gantt that you can create to say, list the same list of =
applications or processes and say, give me put the dates and then say when =
is this idea occurring and when is UAT going to start?

21:51
We have that actually in their app tracker. So I think it's just generating=
 the app tracker, really. So we'll do that. We'll just pull that into a =
sheet. See the problem, Avinash, is a lot of it is generic. They break =
broad dates and teams haven't updated their work Plans. And so that's a =
hygiene issue. But yes, I think at this point, point we will send an update=
.

22:23
I don't know who because I don't want to start shooting any emails=
 because people are going to get confused. There are too many leaders out =
here in this entire program and the last thing that they need is another =
focus. Sending out 10 different emails to say, what the heck are you guys =
doing? Understanding it's going to create more confusion for them.

22:43
Understood.

22:44
Whether it is peers, whether it is somebody on EY or =
whoever it is, they should continue to take the lead and hammer this to say=
 that this is not done. This is what I'm escalating.

23:00
Yep.

23:01
I'm sure they'll go figure out a way to get this done if they have that =
information.

23:05
Right. All right, so we will put that into a tracker. =
So we will get the exact dates today that we have in our inventory and =
we'll start publishing that. And if it's wrong, then that shows up and =
people have to go update it anyway. So we'll force the issue.

23:24
Yep.

23:25
Cool. All right, so we've got action items over the next hours. So =
we'll get working on it and then we'll talk to the IT team and then another=
 four minutes.

23:37
For another meeting. Thank you.

23:39
Thank you. Rakesh. Rakesh, do you have a second to stay on?

23:44
Yeah, I do.

23:45
I just wanted to add a background to this.

23:49
Sure.

23:50
Like what are. What exactly are we asking them?

23:52
I suppose so we're asking I need to be too fancy. But no, it's names needed=
 or IT resources and points of contact needed for each sub function. So =
just say IT roster point of contact needed for, you know, sub function as =
applicable. Right. So yeah, you can remove the key takeaway text. Yep. So =
backup, you could kill all the backup. There's no backup there on the right=
 hand side. Right. It's, you know, just format is not an email. It's go put=
 that information there. Right. Is update the Excel. Sorry, I've got to =
step out for this thing. So let me. I'll connect with you in a couple of =
minutes.

25:06
Okay, thanks, Rakesh. Thank you so much. Thanks, Bye.

time to talk through. I know that we haven&#x27;t personally had the =
opportunity to debrief after the call on Friday, but I think the pressing =
matter is a review for the all IT call. UAT readiness is up on the agenda. =
Just an overall view of what we&#x27;re putting together and then what are =
the gaps and the risks and the immediate actions. Like what, what do we =
need from folks this week and what are we working on? And we wanted to =
review this with you before we put it in front of that audience and then =
hopefully, if we have time, talk about actions for the week, things where, =
where our priorities are at. Really.</div></div><div =

pretty blunt on here just so that we&#x27;re on the same page for it. The =
presentation and what we have going on is great. It&#x27;s right where we =
need to hit it. To me, Rakesh spoke on this earlier last week. Everything =
that we have lined up is exactly where we needed to go. But now we need to =
take it from doing a PowerPoint presentation to we have to do this now. So =
like the deck is the high level. It&#x27;s great for leadership, but now we=
 have to get into it where that dashboard has to go through it, who owes me=
 what? And that needs to go to Sky. So if we don&#x27;t have a name, =
it&#x27;s going to Sky Jeff today. Like we&#x27;re out of time. =
There&#x27;s no more deck, no more discussion on this thing. If someone =
owes us something, it&#x27;s going to Jeff sky today saying, hey, =
they&#x27;ve had two weeks. Because Rakesh, I know some of those stuff =
they&#x27;re supposed to have to list on 23rd.</div></div><div =

what does it look like moving forward? Like the dashboard. You know, I know=

we&#x27;ve got the names, every name that we&#x27;ve gotten, we&#x27;ve put=
 that in Excel. So if you go to the Excel, I think what we don&#x27;t have =
is, yes, the name, some of the names starting with that, but the rest of =
the dashboarding that Sukhai was talking about on. I need to understand =
when KT is happening. I need to understand the people status. I need to =

I said, and seeing the names and seeing where our gaps are, but then we got=
 to start putting the two and two, like, you know, now we have the Excel, =
now we need to get this aligned for it. And Avinash, thanks for joining. =
That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m gonna need some of your help to start bridging =
some of these gaps like ISC Tree and all them are starting to really start =
to message us and ask me about the overall view on how we&#x27;re going to =
look at this. And I think that&#x27;s where that dashboard is going to come=
 in handy of saying, okay, ERP is doing their testing right now for sip. =
Now we do, you know, UAT and it&#x27;s going to start what functions are =
aligned for it. Because ISC is incremental into multiple different work =
streams. So they&#x27;re going to be touching base on it. But now we really=
 got to start hitting the meat of coordination between everybody.=

style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Yeah, so this is so =
two points here. So these are the names we&#x27;ve put and everything =
we&#x27;ve gotten from all of the sources is here. Avinash as well. So =
We&#x27;ve got the UAT functional coordinator names and POCs from each of =
the functions. There are some that are certainly ISC will have to =
understand if there is a business focal or if it&#x27;s the same person =
like Laura is the same saying, well, I think you Gave a ccx but I think =
there was something for Sriram as well where he&#x27;s given all these =
names and I think the other part of this is from an IT perspective is =
Pramod. So we need to get if there&#x27;s additional IT person that is =
supporting sub function in here for Sriram like a CX or procurement or =
logistics. So I think that&#x27;s the next step here. But here&#x27;s. This=
 is really where we have all the gaps now we also have in the context of =
this, the other It&#x27;s. If you go on up and this probably needs to. This=
 table probably will need to change and modify a bit. Do we have stuff =
around IT who is. Okay, so we&#x27;ve got IT focal but we don&#x27;t have a=
. An IT lead per se or like promote. If he&#x27;s got certain people =
supporting him on. On supply chain sub functions, we don&#x27;t have any of=
 those. So I think this is where. So at this point this is the name. These =
are the names we have and all the names we&#x27;ve gotten, we&#x27;ve put =
it in here. I think we now need to start understanding what the gap is so =
that we can then start lighting these up. So Avinash, question for you. Are=
 you able to follow this tracker?</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16=

link and call to action to say listen, this is all blank for it. This is an=
 IT audience. We need you guys to give us all the names for it because then=
 we will go back in and say, okay, if it&#x27;s an end to end process, =
we&#x27;re going to get business testers. What about for some of these apps=
 that are not BRB, like the 10 move as is apps and stuff. You know =
you&#x27;re doing sit right now. Who are your testers for those as well? =
You know, who are your leads? You know, Harry&#x27;s got a few apps that =
are non BRV that are going live. So what&#x27;s he doing about them? So =
that&#x27;s the other piece of it we need. So this dashboard is again, I =
think we need to adjust the dashboard so perhaps show this, show the first =
slide and then give the table at the second. And then the call to action is=
 they need this filled out today, no more. Because tomorrow, in fact, to =
Pierce&#x27;s point, this needs to go out by end of day today to Jeff and =
others and Sukai and say we&#x27;ve got gaps. So call really is guys, get =
on it, fill this names out. Perhaps that&#x27;s step number one. And then =
immediately after we can then talk about what the dashboard for Friday =
should look like so that we can start developing. One of the columns is =
names identified. Another column is, you know, key, you know, business =
names identified and KT done alignment and done sit status, UAT status. So =
that dashboard we could develop right after for a review with peers on =
Wednesday. But I think the call to action today is this is not done. Go =
fill this out. Actually, after Harry Tong, I would leave the other. You =
need to include the rows that are blank.</div></div><div =

We&#x27;ll start developing the dashboard. That and again we&#x27;ll, =
we&#x27;ll look to send a read to you tomorrow, if not before Wednesday, =
Pierce and Avinash. So that way we can at least refine that. We&#x27;ve got=
 a few cycles to refine what we need and then we can see where the data =
flows in from the other part of all of this is. So the next piece of this, =
Avinash, is we need to have this calendar. What I&#x27;m realizing, for =
example, is in the calls from last week, supply chain Pramod and his team =
shared when their sit is happening and for all their systems and some of =
the sits happening now and you know, UAT windows for them from a business =
perspective, Sriram and the business process teams are looking at a view of=
 the calendar that they need to support testing in. What we also heard is =
the ERP team already has calendar windows that Srinivas and Srijib have. =
Bill Ponsetty have developed that they are reaching out and asking, excuse =
me, support for, for ERP testing for uat. So this is where the, the connect=
 the dots and coordination that we need to do is to say, okay, I&#x27;ve =
got so many of these windows coming up. How do we show this end to end and =
how do we have this alignment with, between IT work streams and the =
functions to say, well, ERP is ready, the system is ready in these two =
windows. The supply chain systems are ready prior in these windows or they =
overlap, you know, finance is ready in a little bit later perhaps. So I =
think we need to do that marrying up so that we, we understand all the =
windows that each function, each work stream is ready. So you know, =
functions can go then plan the Scenarios and end to end scenarios and start=
 collaborating there. So that&#x27;s against the, the next step on it. But =
I think that that&#x27;s why these alignment calls are needed now. So =
we&#x27;ll send you an MOS calendar. So if you can help calendar this with =
all the work streams throughout this week, then we can start, you know, =
developing, you know, talking points for each of these and understanding =
and closing the gaps.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:1=
