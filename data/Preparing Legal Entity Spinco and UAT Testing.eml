   -

   *Overview of Initiative*
   - Discussion centers around preparing for a "soft spin" of a company
      within another company=E2=80=99s structure.
      - August 1st is the planned start date for the soft spin; day one of
      full operation is targeted for end of October.
      - The soft spin involves setting up the new entity as a separate
      operational and legal entity, with all necessary staff,
knowledge transfer,
      and systems in place.
      - Testing will occur in this interim period to ensure readiness
      before complete operational independence.
   -

   *Legal Entity (LE) Operationalization*
   - Significant focus on moving employees into appropriate legal entities,
      creating or splitting entities as needed.
      - Goal is to ensure the new (=E2=80=9CSPINCO=E2=80=9D) entity operate=
s correctly
      within legal, structural, and compliance frameworks.
      - ERP systems will be impacted and must be configured to handle new
      LE structures, affecting processes like order-to-cash, purchase and s=
ales
      orders, etc.
   -

   *UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Planning*
   - Kickoff for UAT planning aims to identify which business processes are
      actually changing due to the spin.
      - Although there may be ~1,000 processes, only around 100 might
      change; many systems will remain the same, but personnel and
ownership may
      shift.
      - The plan is to:
         - Catalog processes impacted by the LE changes.
         - Review existing test scenarios for applicability to the new
         context.
         - Use existing scenarios where possible, slightly modify some, and
         create new test cases where necessary.
      - Goal over the next weeks: Define the testing scope, prepare content
      for working sessions, and determine test case requirements.
   -

   *Immediate Action Items & Next Steps*
   - The requester needs support with developing content to facilitate a
      working session scheduled for Thursday.
      - A follow-up, more detailed discussion is set for the following
      morning (suggested: after 9 or 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time).
      - The collaborator (in Denver) agrees to connect around that time;
      logistics will be confirmed via a follow-up message.
   -

   *Key Dates*
   - Soft Spin Start: August 1st
      - Full Operational Independence ("Day One"): End of October
      - Working Session: Scheduled for Thursday (exact date not specified)
      - Follow-up Discussion: Next morning after transcript, around 9 or
      9:30 a.m. Eastern
   -

   *Additional Notes*
   - The conversation references past experience with legal entity work at
      GE Healthcare, but direct involvement was limited.
      - The collaborator is expected to provide support in content
      development, primarily focused on process mapping and UAT planning.

Cash0:00
You are now connected.
Max0:01
You can merge your calls when ready.
Cash0:10
So they're going to go through what's a company in a company period or a
soft spin. So end of October is day one and August 1st is the start of soft
spin. So what we're looking to do is, and what they try to do then is say
that the company can operate as a separate entity within the well,
structure they are, you know, people are hired, all the knowledge transfers
done, all the systems are ready, people can test it out. And when it's, you
know, somewhere in that timeframe when it's tested, things can go live. And
so they start acting as a company within a company. A lot of it has to also
do with legal entity operationalization. And so where that meets here, the
rubber meets the road is if you're, if you're aware or if you're privy to
any of the legal entity work either in GE Healthcare or rtx. Collins
probably not. But were you familiar or anywhere nearby for the, for the
legal entity work in ge?
Max1:17
I mean, I was adjacently affected. I wasn't directly involved in the LE
work experience.
Cash1:24
Okay, so. But the concept is still the same that, you know, we're moving
people to the right legal entities, we're creating new legal entities. We
have to reuse these legal entities, we have to split them up, we have to
operationalize them so that the SPINCO is all operating in the right legal
entities. So there's a quite a bit of work that will happen there. But part
of that as a result of that is, you know, the ERP system will get impacted
with, across all the processes. So the ERP systems will have a view into,
you know, what's happening with, you know, this legal entity. What do I
need to do with now a purchase order or sales order for these legal
entities. How do these business processes like order to cash, you know,
work within this new legal entity, etc. So where what we're trying to do in
short, is kick off the UAT planning and say, okay, hey, business functions,
come talk to us about, you know, let's have a working session on
understanding what your processes are that are changing truly, because you
may have a thousand processes, but there may be only a hundred of them that
change because the rest of it is the process stay the same. You know, in
some cases the systems stay the same. In many cases the people change
because it was somebody in, you know, Honeywell doing it. Now you've got to
have the new company person do it. So those sort of readout and a gauge of
that is what we're trying to do because. And as part of the UAT kickoff,
then the goal of this is to help define what that scope of testing needs to
be, what that scope of, you know, where do we have the test scripts? How do
we, you know, okay, I understand. I've got 1,000 processes. Here's how I do
it normally in Honeywell to test them, but I only have 100 changing. And
let me look at what test scenarios I have available. You know what, 90 out
of the hundred, I can use the existing test scenarios. For another 30, I
might have to tweak my test scenarios somehow. And then for another 20, I
might have to create new test scenarios. So that's the place we're trying
to get to over the next few weeks, starting with this kickoff. And so
needed some, you know, needed you to help me with some content, developing
some content around, you know, what that process would be like, etc. So
that's just in a nutshell. I don't want to go into more details today, but
that's sort of, you know, where I need your horsepower over the next couple
of days to help me with just getting some content on there so that we have
this working session on Thursday. And then moving forward, we can talk
about, you know, you know, how that will be set up in Honeywell.
Max4:13
Sure, yeah. That sounds great. I mean, it makes sense to me. Do you want to
talk in more detail tomorrow morning? I looked at your calendar and you
looked insane.
Cash4:22
Yes. Yeah, it's. It's. Yeah, there's a lot of work, but that's fine. Just
I'll. I'll free up some time. I will not be in some of these meetings, and
so we can talk in the morning. You're in Denver, so I presume. I want to
make it somewhat decent time for you.
Max4:39
Anytime after, like, 9 or 9:30. Probably like 9 Eastern. 9:30? Yeah,
Eastern would be okay.
Cash4:47
Okay, then let's do that. So I'll find a time right after and then. Okay,
so I'll ping you right after sometime there and then we can connect.
Max4:56
Sounds great. Thanks for cash. I appreciate it.
Cash4:58
All right. Yep.
Max4:59
Cool. Looking forward to Max. Thanks.
Cash5:00
Yep, likewise. All right, good night.
