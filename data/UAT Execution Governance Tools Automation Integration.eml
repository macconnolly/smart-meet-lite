UAT Execution Governance Tools Automation Integration

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Execution =
Approach
- **Stakeholder Request:** Sukai requested a detailed explanation =
of how UAT is run and executed, especially from an IT-centric perspective.
- **Objective:** Provide examples from previous engagements and outline the=
 structure, roles, and responsibilities regarding UAT.
- **Depth Required:** A need to zoom in on governance, roles, decision =
rights, escalation processes, and execution specifics.
- **Framework Proposal:**
  - **Overview/Approach**
  - **Roles and Responsibilities:** Details on decision rights (e.g., who =
is accountable, responsible, consulted, informed).
  - **Governance =
Structure:** Escalation levels, decision-making, and oversight.
  - **Meeting Cadence:** Structure and timing for coordination.
  - **Execution:** Test planning, actual UAT execution, hypercare, and =
post-UAT support.
  - **Tracking and Reporting:** How scenario progress, =
test scripts, execution status, and defects are monitored and reported.
  - **Defect Remediation:** Severity definitions, tracking resolutions, and=
 timelines.

### 2. Tools and Automation
- **Current Tools:** JIRA is =
mentioned as the main tracking tool; potential integration with Oryx for =
workflow and test script management.
- **Automation Initiatives:**=20
  - Discussion about automating testing processes using AI and tools like =
Copilot, which can generate test scripts and manage workflows.
  - Different team members have varying opinions about the level and =
implementation of automation, and there is an intention to align these =
views.
- **Reporting Needs:** High-level dashboard metrics: number of =
scenarios, status (written, executed, completed), points of contact, and =
on-time progress.

### 3. Organizational Alignment and Knowledge Sharing
- **Leveraging Internal Experts:** Intent to collaborate with staff =
experienced in UAT, ensuring the process aligns with existing =
organizational standards.
- **Customization:** The approach will be modeled=
 on established internal practices rather than a one-size-fits-all outside =
template.
- **Key Personnel:** Piers is identified as the IT UAT =
coordinator needing clear process definitions and governance to be =
effective.

### 4. Follow-ups and Action Items
- **Structure Required:** =
Suggestion to combine framework elements (overview, roles, governance, =
cadence) into a clear, possibly single, document or presentation.
- **Immediate Needs:**=20
  - Provide Piers with a structured plan to =
coordinate UAT across functions.
  - Prepare for a detailed conversation on=
 Friday with Jeff, focusing on automation and AI-assisted scenarios.
  - Connect with internal experts on UAT for organizational insights.
  - Show a high-level execution tracker and reporting dashboard.
- **SAP License Issue:**
  - Side conversation about an SAP license =
end-of-life concern (ends in 2027, not sooner).
  - Possible negotiation =
and technical solution (search pack upgrade), coordination with SB Friday =
resource named Mo.

---

## Key Dates and Persons

- **Thursday (last):** =
Sukai requested UAT execution details.
- **Friday (upcoming):** Planned =
discussion with Jeff (automation/AI perspective) and involvement of Mo (SAP=
 resource).
- **2027:** Stated as the end-of-life date for the current SAP =
license version.

---

## Additional Notes

- The process aims to balance =
new (AI/automation) and existing organizational standards.
- Explicit need to clarify both tactical execution and governance/goals.
- Importance of tracking, reporting, and timely escalation of UAT issues.
- Side topic on SAP license highlights the need for accurate information =
and resourceful negotiations.

Problem that we're solving =
like this, they.

0:02
Want a point of view. So Sukai wants a view into how=
 we run and execute uat.

0:09
V I T V I T well.

0:11
It, but more so ey. So she asked last Thursday of tell us, you know, give =
us a few examples. She wants to double click and triple click into how UAT =
is executed and how that connective tissue works. And it's more from an IT =
centric view. So she said tell us how you've done it on other engagements =
and how the structure would work and how you'd run it so that we can learn =
from it.

0:39
Because if that's the case, then I think one of the things, =
maybe this is in your overview, but I think roles, responsibilities matter =
a lot here. And I know you, I saw a page, you had like a pretty detailed =
one but at a high. And I think we already did a page on like the high level=
 roles. But what I'm thinking is like even basic stuff like is UAT it LED =
functionally supported or like you remember you have that page where like =
the different phases, that basic stuff and then what are those key roles? =
What role do they play in that? Laying that out is a big part of how we're =
going to manage this.

1:12
Where does UAT fit and roles and =
responsibilities?

1:15
Yeah, it's basically zooming in on one of those =
chevrons that you did.

1:22
So where does approach uat? Where does it fit =
roles and responsibilities in the Org. That's more of framework. So this =
one just talks of, this is for UAT planning, but it's really more here =
governance. How do you. This is. I guess.

2:03
Yeah. So if, if you, if you=
 define the roles and responsibilities in my mind that's literally what are=
 the roles and then who has decision rights AR or something like that? =
Right. Then the next thing down should be probably something around the =
governance structure. Right. Like what are the levels, who you know, how do=
 we escalate stuff like that? Like something really Honestly, a structure =
that's some of your bullet points here. Probably you can probably combine =
one page on a lot of this stuff.

2:33
Yeah. So probably it's you know, =
overview approach and then roles and responsibilities and then governance =
structure.

2:40
Yeah. And then, and then the next thing in there is, you =
know, meeting structure and cadence or something. Right?

2:46
Yeah.

2:47
Like I'm just saying like super generic stuff. Like you do fit all this =
together.

2:56
Somewhere in here there's a. Well, there's execution. =
There's somewhere in here there's a hyper care.

3:02
Yeah. And then I think one other page that we have on here is tracking and =
reporting structure. Right. Like literally how are we going to what tool =
are we tracking the details in? How are we doing high level reporting?

3:16
You know, what's the workflow in that tool? I think that that's really=
 like where Pierce needs to get to.

3:24
Right.

3:25
Is the super like tactical for him? How do I actually set this up and run =
it?

3:32
Just making it up. Let's say that they work in jira.

3:35
Yeah.

3:35
All the details will live in jira.

3:36
Exactly.

3:37
All you need to know in your roll up is how many scenarios or what are the =
scenarios. How many scenarios, like who's on point for them? Are they done?=
 Yes or no? Yeah, stuff like that. Dashboard of how many are done out of =
how many total? Are you ready? I'll agree. And stuff like that.

3:53
Exactly.

3:54
Right, yeah.

3:54
How many scenarios exist, how many are =
written, how many test scripts correspond to those, how many new, existing =
or not needed? And then how many of those test scripts have been executed?

4:08
Yeah, yeah, right.

4:09
Which is pretty much that tracker that we put=
 together for him. Like the roll up view.

4:15
Yeah. And that's, that's =
going to be like time bound. Right? Like yeah, we expect these will be done=
 by this point. You can track as to whether or not they're on time and then=
 there'll be something on the back end of that. Defect remediation.

4:26
Exactly.

4:27
How to track defect remediation? There's mismane defects. We=
 probably need to have sep1, sub2, some like level of severity.

4:35
Yeah.

4:35
So we need to define that.

4:40
I mean show him this at a high level=
.

4:44
Yeah, this is execution down here. There's also the. Well there's a=
 planning portion and execution here and then down there later there's a =
defect resolution and hypercam management.

4:54
This one. Yeah.

4:57
Yeah, but. Oh good, there's a scenario right there.

5:00
So we could leverage a lot of.

5:02
This and they should use like one of =
the assumptions in this. You guys feel free to push back on this. But my =
starting point for this is we should start with their existing standards on=
 this like they do uat.

5:14
We were talking about this yesterday, Aneesh.=
 And this is where I want to get in a room with those guys that you =
mentioned that are super helpful and have been doing UAT for 20 years. And =
I want them to say how does this work in your org right now?

5:33
Because what they're actually trying to do.

5:35
Yeah, how can we model =
this after what you're doing? Because.

5:38
And what they're trying to do =
right now as well. I don't know how Applicable this is for everything else =
is they want to automate all the testing and again, I don't know the =
feasibility of that. They're going through those discussions right now.

5:54
That's the, I guess the entirety of it. These guys want to use AI, =
these guys want to do everything. Automation is part of the game. Yeah, I =
think very tactically speaking that comes in here of how do you execute it,=
 how do you do all that? That's the how. We need to understand the what and=
 the why first and lay it out for these guys and say, here's why you need =
what you need to solve for and why you need to solve for it. And here's the=
 way you go about doing it. The piece you're mentioning is down the lane. =
Later on I'm going to be. Here's the same thing, jira and there's a twin in=
 jira, Oryx that does flow management. They leverage that. You create test =
scripts, it automates the generation of test scripts and it uploads it into=
 JIRA and it's got workflow management, all that other stuff. This guy on =
the other hand, what's his name? Jeff. Jeff was of the opinion. Let's use =
Copilot. Let's describe the scenario. Copilot and AI will change those =
scenarios to requirements and test script for us. And you can use your =
automated tool to upload it into JIRA and execute it automatically. Voila. =
And you know, RuPaul's my uncle, so that's the way he's thinking. So we =
need to temper him down a bit on that. But he's also going to be on this =
Friday conversation. But we need to. He will cut double click and triple =
click into it. But I think it's a sliver of everything else because Piers =
is kind of totally lost. He's relying on us to give him everything and =
spoon feed. He's got two needs. One, he needs to chase down people on a =
high level to get ready and two, he wants to know how to run this because =
he is the UAT coordinator for IT and he's got to be the connective tissue =
across functions. So in that MOS or in that governance structure somewhere =
in there that we laid out, you know, he's somewhere in here, right. So =
whatever that's in, that's him and he's got to be driving some of that =
stuff. So, okay, so governance structure, typically mos. We also have, =
before this gets into how we run things, how we do hypercare and defect =
remediation, there's also how to recall. Oh with Sam.

8:19
By the way, who was that asked for the SAP resource about the licensing =
issue? Was that you or is that Andrew?

8:24
That might be Andrew.

8:25
Okay, I have a call for that right now.

8:27
Sab.

8:28
Oh yeah, they have the end of life issue with their SAP license and I'm =
calling bullshit on it because that doesn't end life until 2027.

8:37
This version I need to do the.

8:40
Search pack upgrade, right?

8:41
So yeah, that's why we wanted to do it. Dinesh said, no, we're not doing =
that, and he would negotiate and find a way to extend the life.

8:49
So that's why I'm trying to get you help with we have a person in our SB =
Friday, his name Mo, who used to do.

6">That&#x27;s the, I guess the entirety of it. These guys want to use AI, =
these guys want to do everything. Automation is part of the game. Yeah, I =
think very tactically speaking that comes in here of how do you execute it,=
 how do you do all that? That&#x27;s the how. We need to understand the =
what and the why first and lay it out for these guys and say, here&#x27;s =
why you need what you need to solve for and why you need to solve for it. =
And here&#x27;s the way you go about doing it. The piece you&#x27;re =
mentioning is down the lane. Later on I&#x27;m going to be. Here&#x27;s the=
 same thing, jira and there&#x27;s a twin in jira, Oryx that does flow =
management. They leverage that. You create test scripts, it automates the =
generation of test scripts and it uploads it into JIRA and it&#x27;s got =
workflow management, all that other stuff. This guy on the other hand, =
what&#x27;s his name? Jeff. Jeff was of the opinion. Let&#x27;s use Copilot=
. Let&#x27;s describe the scenario. Copilot and AI will change those =
scenarios to requirements and test script for us. And you can use your =
automated tool to upload it into JIRA and execute it automatically. Voila. =
And you know, RuPaul&#x27;s my uncle, so that&#x27;s the way he&#x27;s =
thinking. So we need to temper him down a bit on that. But he&#x27;s also =
going to be on this Friday conversation. But we need to. He will cut double=
 click and triple click into it. But I think it&#x27;s a sliver of =
everything else because Piers is kind of totally lost. He&#x27;s relying on=
 us to give him everything and spoon feed. He&#x27;s got two needs. One, he=
 needs to chase down people on a high level to get ready and two, he wants =
to know how to run this because he is the UAT coordinator for IT and =
he&#x27;s got to be the connective tissue across functions. So in that MOS =
or in that governance structure somewhere in there that we laid out, you =
know, he&#x27;s somewhere in here, right. So whatever that&#x27;s in, =
that&#x27;s him and he&#x27;s got to be driving some of that stuff. So, =
okay, so governance structure, typically mos. We also have, before this =
gets into how we run things, how we do hypercare and defect remediation, =
there&#x27;s also how to recall. Oh with Sam.</div></div><div =
