Meeting Summary

*Date:* June 17, 2025
*Participants:* Rakesh, Andre, Bill, Audrey, Jessica, Vicki, Sukai
(mentioned), others
*Meeting Times Noted:*

   - 7:00 AM ET daily call with Sukai
   - 1:30 PM ET call with Jessica and team
   - 4:00 PM ET follow-up call
   - 6:30 AM tomorrow meeting with offshore team
   - Regular Friday status call with Sukai
   - Internal regroup at 3:30 PM

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. Preparation and Roll-Up of UAT Test Scripts and
Trackers

   - *Summary Preparation*: Andre and Bill are working to prepare a summary
   for UAT (User Acceptance Testing). Andre has a draft and has consolidate=
d
   test scripts from different folders and teams using test script
   documentation.
   - *Required Components*: The summary must include the number of test
   cases, hyperlinks to access these scripts, and a list of UAT team member=
s.
   - *Division of Trackers*: Rakesh=E2=80=99s team has prepared two tracker=
s:
      - *BRB Readiness Tracker:* Split into Finance and Non-Finance (ERP
      and non-ERP).
      - *Missing Data:* Some sections of the tracker need to be populated
      before sharing further.
   - *Hyperlinks & Details*: Hyperlinks must point to detailed scripts,
   mostly stored in SharePoint, accessible via links in the summary tables.

2. Ownership, Script Format, and Tools

   - *Script Creation Ownership*: Functional teams in IT created and loaded
   the test scripts; Andre consolidated these summaries for management revi=
ew.
   - *Script Format*: Debate over script formats and adequacy, with
   frustration expressed that not all scripts fit the standard or show
   sufficient end-to-end detail.
   - *Tools Used*:
      - *Tosca*: Preferred testing automation tool as per Sukai=E2=80=99s l=
atest
      ask, although it=E2=80=99s new to some deployment teams.
      - *Jira*: Traditional tool, more familiar to the team, still used for
      regression and defect management.
      - *Excel*: For consolidating and linking data and manual tracking.
   - *Automation vs. Manual Testing*: Concerns discussed about reliance on
   Tosca (risk of the unfamiliar), with fallback options to use regression
   scripts from Jira if Tosca falters.

3. Concerns over Test Script Readiness and Requirements

   - *Timing Issues*: The team could not meet same-day requests due to time
   difference with the Indian team and incomplete deliverables.
   - *Expectations for Friday*: There's a hard deadline to be fully ready
   for the Friday status call with Sukai.
   - *Management Demands*: Sukai (and Jeff above her) are asking for
   "double and triple click" transparency=E2=80=94i.e., the ability to dril=
l into
   testing details down to individual scripts, names, and process steps.

4. Team Member Identification and Responsibilities

   - *Key Issue*: Gaps in identifying hands-on UAT testers for each
   functional area. Many names given are function leads, but Sukai wants
   confirmed "hands on keyboard" people for actual test execution.
   - *Responsibility*: It's repeatedly noted that IT and corporate
   functions cannot supply business-side testers=E2=80=99 names; this is a =
business/AM
   (Advanced Materials) responsibility.
      - Jessica and Vicki are tasked to =E2=80=9Cchase=E2=80=9D business te=
ams to fill
      staffing gaps.
   - *Table of Roles*: The need for a structured matrix listing:
   workstream, responsible leads, and actual testers=E2=80=94with gaps clea=
rly
   indicated for business-side follow-up.

5. Reporting, Transparency, and Defect Tracking

   - *PowerBI Dashboard*: Rakesh=E2=80=99s team is developing a dashboard f=
or
   executive visibility, with drill-down capability.
   - *Defect Tracking*:
      - *Finance:* Manual/Excel-based, with SharePoint links to trackers.
      - *ERP:* Ideally reported from Tosca or via automated reports/output
      folders, as no direct access for all teams to Tosca.
      - *Request for Linking:* Even if links to SharePoint or Tosca are not
      operational for all, providing them demonstrates structured tracking =
and
      satisfies management=E2=80=99s documentation asks.

6. Immediate Next Steps for Upcoming Meetings

   - *1:30 PM and 4:00 PM Calls:* Progress check-in with Jessica and Vicki
   to review status and share updated matrices, bullet points, and summary
   views.
   - *Tomorrow=E2=80=99s Report-out*: Need a clear, standardized format by
   tomorrow, with as much completion as possible, especially on business
   tester names.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1.

   *Populate Missing Tracker Data* (Rakesh/Team)
   - Complete BRB readiness and other UAT trackers with latest test scripts
      and participant info.
   2.

   *Finalize Script Summaries* (Andre, Bill)
   - Consolidate ERP and non-ERP test scripts in a tabular format,
      including: workstream, number of scripts, hyperlinks, and tester name=
s.
   3.

   *Review and Align with Bill* (Andre)
   - Workshop draft view in today=E2=80=99s sessions; ensure both Finance a=
nd ERP
      follow a uniform structure.
   4.

   *Address Format and Content Issues in Scripts* (Bill)

      scenarios.
   5.

   *Clarify and Assign UAT Tester Names* (All Leads, with Jessica/Vicki to
   chase business-side gaps)
   - Create matrix of function leads and hands-on testers; clearly flag any
      gaps for escalation.
   6.

   *Add Tracking Mechanism Columns to Matrices* (Srinivas, Bill, Audrey)
   - For each workstream, specify:
         - Testing method (Manual/Automated/Tosca)
         - Defect management mechanism (Jira, Tosca, Excel, SharePoint link=
)
      - Add links to relevant SharePoint sites and/or output folders, even
      if access not universal.
   7.

   *Coordinate with Business Leads for Outstanding Tester Names* (Rakesh,
   Bill, Jessica/Vicki as PMs)
   - Escalate to AM (Advanced Materials) and program management where gaps
      persist.

------------------------------
Follow-up / Next Meetings

   - *June 17, 2025:*
      - 1:30 PM ET =E2=80=93 Status check with Jessica, Vicki, and team
      - 4:00 PM ET =E2=80=93 Further progress review, specific gaps/action =
planning
      - 3:30 PM ET =E2=80=93 Internal regroup before 4:00 PM call
   - *June 18, 2025:*
      - 6:30 AM call with Indian order management team (Bill)
      - 7:00 AM daily AM call with Sukai
      - EOD tomorrow as deadline for cleaned-up tracker with all available
      names/links/scripts
   - *June 20, 2025 (Friday):*
      - Major report-out to Sukai and team (must be fully prepared)
   - *Ongoing:* Twice-daily touchpoints with Jessica and Vicki; daily with
   Sukai.

------------------------------
Additional Notes

   - *Escalation Path for Gaps:* IT and program teams cannot be responsible
   for sourcing all business-side/production user testers; must escalate to=
 AM
   or relevant business function leads.
   - *Tooling Tension:* Unfamiliarity with Tosca is a risk; fallback to
   Jira/manual known regression scripts is possible.
   - *Expectation Management:* Must be clear and candid with management
   about gaps and root causes. Transparency is valued over perfection.
   - *Documentation Quality:* Links, summaries, and trackers=E2=80=94regard=
less of
   direct accessibility=E2=80=94must evidence structured, comprehensive pla=
nning and
   execution effort.
   - *Ownership and Accountability:* Clear division of labor between
   program/IT (script aggregation, technical set-up) and business owners (t=
est
   participants, validation).

------------------------------

*End of Summary*
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Rakesh0:00
It's.
Audrey0:43
Okay. I think we can probably get started. So Rakesh, let me know when
you're back. So Andre, did you get a chance to connect with Bill to prepare
the summary?
Andre1:03
Bill and I have a connect later to do it but I have a draft view ready.
Audrey1:12
Later today meaning end of today oven because we have a call at 1:30 with
Jessica and team. I think I forwarded the invite. Keyboard, right?
Andre1:22
Yes, I have a draft view. I wasn't able to review it with Bill yet but I, I
guess maybe we can use this session to workshop.
Bill1:54
Yep.
Andre1:54
So I used the test scripts to kind of pull in together all of the links
from the, from the test script folder that the teams have been putting in
and then created this like roll up and then these are the contacts that we
drafted together streaming us with Bill last week.
Audrey2:20
Yeah, so I think I need to cover this is very high level to them. Audrey.
Okay, let me share my screen again. Okay.
Bill2:45
Yes.
Audrey2:47
I mean I know you've just started working on this for erp for non ERP and I
kind of prepared a summary which would probably suffice to present in
tomorrow's meeting. But then we need to provide as much as details we can.
That should be our work stream of function within erp. Number of test
cases, scripts, then hyperlink to access those scripts. Right, that's
number one. Number two is list of UAT team members, whoever is going to
participate. I think we talked about this request to you know, previous
meeting. So let me share screen.
Joe3:30
Yeah, sure. I was going to say you should share your screen if you have
something.
Audrey3:34
Yeah, yeah, just open, just give me 10 seconds.
Joe3:40
Might have to leave for a minute or two. My computer, computer is telling
me it's going to automatically restart.
Audrey3:47
Sure. So there are two requests. Rakesh, are you back? Let me know if
you're go grab a coffee or something. So there are two asks from today's
call. Right. One is the two trackers prepared by Rakesh and team. One is
about the BRB readiness. Right. One is for finance and non finance. I think
he created one. This is for ERP and this for non erp. If I open this right.
I mean any one of them. Right. I just. Let me open this. I think the ask
from this spreadsheet is to populate some missing information that Rakesh
has put together. So I think for which we have a call at 1:30. Right. So
I'm not worried about this on this call. Right. So then our key focus
should be for the request that did come in today's meeting. So What I did.
So again this I focused with finance right after my call from Sukai. So
what I did, I have listed down my work streams within Finance. Right. Then
I have captured number of test scripts that we have aligned in most of the
except Tax and Work UI which we're working on. So we have these test
scripts and we know what are those test scripts are referring to. Right.
Then there's a hyperlink. If you click on this, it takes them to the
SharePoint which will then provide the detailed script information.
Obviously they will definitely go through that, but for them. Coming back
to our summary for who did that?
Joe5:28
When you clicked on a link, who did that work?
Audrey5:31
I did it, but the scripts were put together is our function. This, this
Excel which you see these scripts are put together by R wordstream
functional. This summary I created.
Joe5:45
Somebody on the Athens team did it under Finance.
Audrey5:50
Which one?
Joe5:52
The one you just clicked on. I'm trying to understand who's doing the work.
You did all that?
Audrey5:58
Yeah, this summary I did. I mean what our team did is within our IT group,
they basically loaded all the test scripts into a team role. So I went
there and I just consolidated into the summary sheet.
Joe6:14
Okay, so like on this one. All right, I think I know what you're saying. So
somebody on the finance IT team went in and created the scripts, right?
Audrey6:30
Yes.
Joe6:32
Okay. Okay.
Audrey6:36
Yeah. And then this is the summary that I think Jessica and Vicky were
looking for the upcoming call. Now again coming back to erp, I know you are
working with Bill to put together something like this. We have a meeting
meeting at 1:30 and then there's one more call at 4:00. So by when do you
think you guys can be ready? So that way we can consolidate together.
Joe7:01
Yeah, but we're not gonna be ready.
Bill7:03
We're not gonna be ready today. We can't have a fire drill one morning and
then say all this has to be ready at 1:30. You know, today just the team
has not accomplished what I asked them to accomplish. Most of them are
sleeping now in India. I just got off the phone with the order management
team at least because one of them was still around. I have schedul a
meeting at 6:30 tomorrow morning so they can understand the deliverable.
I've given them templates and formats on what they need to have it proper.
When you click on that link there to that test script, those don't look.
That's not what I'd want to see either. Those are not end to end scripts.
Little snippet like that, that's not what they want to see. You heard Benny
on the call earlier. That's not what he expects to see either. We have a
call on Friday with, with Sukai and we need to be really ready.
Audrey7:59
So I'm sorry, I quite don't understand your comment.
Joe8:02
Tell me about the scripts and using this task. You don't mind, what is it
called? Taska.
Bill8:08
Taska, yeah. So with the what we saw today or what we clicked on today, I
was, you know, disappointed to see that because it was more instructions
for what steps for the Taska team or the automation team to include in
these scenarios. It's not really a properly formatted UAT task test script
that I could, you know, if we were using Jira, that I could, you know,
ingest into Jira.
Joe8:36
Why can't, why can't we just use jira?
Bill8:39
Because I was instructed to use Tosca.
Joe8:43
On the last call with Sukai. I think it was the Monday 7am call. She said
if task is, nobody's used Tosca before. Right.
Bill8:58
She talked to me about that yesterday. So, you know, you had a conversation
with her on Monday. I had a conversation with her on Wednesday. Not
Wednesday, you know, or at the all it Hands meeting. So the 10:30 call. So
it was Monday. I'm losing track of the day, of the freaking week it is. And
explained it to her and Paul was on there. He's familiar with it. He's
familiar with the team as well. Her concern was are we being delayed for
UAT because of Tosca or is Taska going to accelerate our ability to get
through uat and why? And so I explained to her why. Right. It's not an
impediment, you know, for us at all. And that it's actually makes more
efficient use of the time of the business. So they're not sitting for
hours, you know, typing in T codes to create the outputs. Because, Joe, as
you know, we're not changing processes. You know, the way Preetha and her
team create a sales order today is the same way they're going to create our
sales order on a 2. What is changing are the outputs and that's what we're
going to use the business team to validate. So the automation is taking
these scripts that run through all the scenarios and create every output
along the way. All right.
Joe10:15
But I guess the initial concern, and I kind of echoed it a little bit, said
if nobody has used it before and it's not proven, then.
Bill10:27
We.
Joe10:27
Could be adding some risk to the timeline because it's not in our
wheelhouse. Right. It's not something that our team has used in the past to
update. If you're saying it's more of like we do less, we hand it over.
They set it all up and we should have, we should have all these test
scripts anyway. Right. We're not creating everything from scratch.
Bill10:56
Well, you would think. And I provided it to the team, you know, like months
ago and I assume that's the sheet of music they were singing from, but I
guess my assumption was incorrect. But they do use, they being the
automation team, they use it every day, every month to do regression
testing across all of the SAP instances in Honeywell. So it's used all the
time.
Joe11:22
So why can't we take all those test scripts, pick out a whole bunch and say
these are the ones you give to the task of folks. Right. Like we don't need
to recreate the wheel here. Right.
Bill11:40
So I agree.
Joe11:44
We got to think through what is the best way to use what we have. And
clearly as soon as we get one hiccup from Taska, then we might just say,
you have the power to say, let's just go back and use what we know. Right.
And also thinking out loud, right. Why can't we just say that our
regression testing team is going to run all of these scripts on CIP 900 and
we'll coordinate with them? You know what I mean?
Bill12:30
Yeah, that's what we have been saying. I mean, I get a. The only thing that
I'm waiting on from them and it's not like it's delaying us in any way,
shape or form is the completion of all of the script which is slated to be
done either right before or during our sit window that we have starting the
23rd through the 2nd of July is I want the results. You know, they've told
me and they're going to share with me tomorrow. You know what that looks
like. You know, these are the scripts we ran. This is how many of them
passed. You know, there was an error with this one. Here's our mitigation
plan. Plan, just like we would get out of HBQC in the old days. And I'm
fine with that, but I just want to see it so that I can embed it as part of
our deliverable, you know, back to Sukai and her team. So that and Jeff,
you know, so they can see it every day they want. Not just from erp, but
from Finance, everybody, ccx. They want to see, you know, this dashboard
that I think Rakesh and team are putting together for them. You Know, Power
BI dashboard that they can look at at a high level and then double click in
to get more detail. So we have to provide them with the detail that they'll
be able to drill down into, and that's what we're providing.
Joe13:51
I'm not making a connection in my head yet between what we have to show,
like today, tomorrow or Friday or whatever. And is that value added?
Because, I mean, what you're showing right now, streaming boss, isn't
anything anybody's going to use, right?
Audrey14:08
No.
Rakesh14:11
It'S not, Joe, it's not. But this is something Sukai wanted to double click
on as a table to say, I want a breakdown of what are your areas, what are
the number of scenarios, you know, where are the links to the scripts for
those scenarios? So she wants it. She wants several double clicks and this
is one of them.
Joe14:36
Okay, but sometimes we have to challenge some of that stuff, right? Like we
gotta be able to say. We gotta be able to say, I understand what you want.
You just need to be able to see all the scripts that we have and understand
them. Right? I mean, how, how excited was she this morning at seven?
Rakesh14:56
Very pissed. Okay, so she's wanting to double click and triple click into
everything we provided her status updates. She's like, I want to see the
sausage making. So what she asked was, you know, the things that Srinivas
already mentioned there, Joe, that she wants a double click into the UAT
test scenario summary by workstream. So this is what Srinivas has provided
here. And I think, you know, let's double.
Joe15:31
Click on the first one then real quick. Okay, again. Yes, let's stay, let's
stay there for a moment. All this is saying is run depreciation, right?
Audrey15:45
Yeah.
Joe15:47
Run the T code for asset retirement. Maybe in the finance area, most of our
scripts might be we're just running and testing jobs, but when we get into
the integrated supply chain, are we running some integrated scripts which
says create requisition, approve requisition, create the po, do a goods
receipt, do an invoice receipt. Are we doing that? I mean, that's what a
test script is, right?
Audrey16:19
Yeah, yeah, that's correct. I think that we will be doing that too.
Rakesh16:27
Sorry, Bill, you were going to say something then?
Bill16:29
No, I was just agreeing. You know, there are finance steps, not these, that
will be. That are in certain inserted in an order to cache scenario proper
test script. And I just showed Arjun, you know, a little while ago. Why,
why are we deviating from this? You know, maybe this is useful for Sriram I
mean not for Sriram but for Srinivas, you know, because.
Audrey16:52
Sorry for the interruption. Right. I'm not saying this is not useful or
this is useful. I just focus only to put.
Bill17:00
What is the name of. Where does it tell me if I'm. If I'm sukai. What does
it say? Where's the name of this scenario? That should be the top of the
page. What are you doing here? Joe knows because Joe's a finance guru.
You're assuming she is. If she clicked on that button and she goes to UAT
Test scripts or Scripps Finance, which you just did, and goes to that other
page, it's a workbook with multiple tabs that she has to then go through.
Through. Right.
Audrey17:33
I'm sorry, what's going on here? The ask from this morning, I mean I
understand from end to end like Joe commented. Right. Of course. When we do
end to end all of this, right. It's cross functional effort. It should
include when into end script reviewed. Each and every process step should
be included. Right. Be it finance or whoever is creating an order. Order.
Bill17:56
Right.
Audrey17:56
But then the ask from this morning's college. I think she wanted to deep
dive by work stream. By work stream, understand what are the list of test
scripts that you have created for each of your work stream and how many of
them and where is access to those scripts? Okay. As you know, Finance is
not going to use that task matter whatever tool that we have discussed
because our applications could vary from testing to spectrum because I have
some like example tax application. Right. The scenarios could vary. Of
course there is one scenario in cross functional where we are covering
right. With the other teams. But when it comes to fscm it may not be, not
necessarily that I need to use task or tool. Right. So now I think why
don't we simplify it. I think we are making it the complexity bigger and
bigger for what we need to report out for tomorrow.
Rakesh18:44
And I'm with you on both sides. So I think Srinivas as a start, I think
this is what she's looking for. But I think to Bill's point, she or Jessica
or you know, the, the people she's got tagging with her, they'll double
click into this and they'll come in and say okay, this script doesn't look
great or this isn't a non standard format. So I think it's just avoiding
giving them the chance to, to beat us up further on that.
Bill19:13
Yeah, I agree. I mean we have a standard format and Benny was right, Right.
You know, when he Reamed us out, you know, jumped all over my ass. He was
right to, you know, and I was disappointed that the team isn't using what I
provided them.
Joe19:27
Okay, well then how do we get Bill, how do we get to what we need to show?
Bill19:31
Oh, I'm getting it, trust me. It's my turn to ream some ass. Okay, this is.
Joe19:37
No, but how do we show it? That's what I'm saying. Not is the work. Did the
work get done or not? But how do we show it? Like what, what is the plan?
Bill19:44
Well, I think three of us has got the right format there because that's
what was asked. Yeah, but it's got a link to, you know, something that's
meaningful.
Joe19:55
Yeah. And the test scripts we have today, are they really technical? Like
what. These are test scripts that are in, what's the testing app again?
Bill20:07
Jira.
Audrey20:10
Yeah, no, the task mark something you.
Joe20:16
Task is the new, new stuff though. They're not in there.
Bill20:18
The old one is JIRA used to be hbqc and then they went away from that
because it worked well and they would put us in jira.
Joe20:26
So just. So just for my edification, right, they're going to go into JIRA
era, get those tests scripts, whatever format they're in, put them into an
area where we can create a link and link to them from an Excel file.
Bill20:42
Exactly. Correct.
Joe20:45
Okay, so we don't have to rewrite any scripts. We're just going to grab
everything from the regression testing team.
Bill20:52
We need to change, you know, the inputs, right? You know, the plant and the
material, you know, those, those kinds of things to fit the purpose of, you
know, each of those different company codes.
Joe21:06
Okay, so in the meeting, there's a meeting, what time this afternoon?
Audrey21:11
There's one at 130 and there's one at 4 o' clock.
Rakesh21:22
So Sukai is Joe Sukai set up a 7am Eastern every morning. Morning. And then
her, her team there, Jessica and Vicki, have set up twice a day touch
points to make sure that we're on track. So two additional. This one, this
one's at 1:30 Eastern.
Joe21:41
All right, well, call me in if you need me, but I think the message needs
to be this, right? It needs to be. We're gonna, we're. We have to explain
it to her. We have EUROS scripts in the regression lab. She doesn't know
this stuff. Right. We have the scripts already created in that our
regression testing team has done and has used for years. They're in an
application called jira. We are in the process of working with the team, we
can't get to them because of Indian hours. We are aggressively working with
the team to meet your requirement to get the scripts, to get a copy of the
scripts that we plan on running and get them into Excel and then prepare a
presentation with some links to those testing scripts so you could have
full visibility of everything we're going to test. Now that's just for
visibility purpose. We're not really using that. Right. Then we have to
make a comment that says if Taska doesn't work out and it's not moving
forward quickly, we're just going to work with our regression testing team
and use our test scripts that we just showed you that. Well, that we are
going to show you that are in Europe. We're just going to run everything
from there. Right. People agree with that.
Bill23:09
Makes sense to me.
Rakesh23:11
Makes sense. I think if I will play devil's advocate there, Joe, she's
going to ask you first question. When are we going to have the. When are we
going to have a separate timeline to get this Excel cleaned up?
Joe23:25
And that'll be tomorrow after Bill gets to speak with the team.
Rakesh23:30
Understood.
Bill23:31
I already got some of them working on it. I'll catch the ones that you know
in US time zone.
Rakesh23:36
Okay.
Bill23:37
I'd be on the other ones right now, but we're on this one.
Rakesh23:40
Okay, understood. So we'll tell her tomorrow end of day, we'll have that
cleaned up. The second part she'll ask is if you're using Regression. Bill,
the way you explained to her was using tosca. The automation team will
execute hands on keyboard and the function leads will be validation.
Bill23:59
Validation.
Rakesh24:00
If you go to regression team, then you probably need testers for every one
of these, correct?
Joe24:05
No.
Bill24:06
Yeah, well, no, no. If we go to jira, we would need jira.
Rakesh24:10
Right. So if you don't use TOSCA and you use jira, then she will ask us,
get me a name for each of these areas that you're. I need test names or
hands on keyboard because she wasn't happy with the function leads. She
wanted names on keyboards.
Joe24:23
That's not, that's not going to be Bill the Chase. It's called, it's called
uat. So we, we have to put that back on advanced materials. They, they have
to know. I mean, if it's a corporate function, we could help find the
names. Right. But if it's somebody at the factory or some name, we need
that user, we need that lead from am. And Bill's not going to know that
Bill's not going to know these people.
Rakesh24:52
People he's not. I think the ask then is how do we get those. So, Bill, is
that working with Sriram? And that's what I'm doing.
Bill25:00
I've been, you know, working with some of those people to, you know, it's
not complete, you know, but I was working on it. You know, I have a lot of.
I'm trying to consolidate it into an easier to digest, you know, view like
this, you know, you know, who from order management, you know, we working
with that are going to be, you know, our validators, you know,
manufacturing procurement. So this is a work in progress, you know, that
I'm taking from all of the contacts that have been given to me by each of
the. Of the areas. I know she said she wanted three people, but there's
only one guy that handles, you know, APO for advanced materials. So unless
they're gonna hire two more, it's gonna have to be Jerry.
Rakesh25:41
So I think the question she asked when she looked at that was, I know these
people. I don't think Jerry is the hands on keyboard customers guy. Who is
the person that he's going to say is hands on keyboard.
Bill25:50
Jerry tells me he is the hands on keyboard guy.
Rakesh25:53
Okay, so these names.
Joe25:55
Yeah, yeah, but guys, but guys, we have to direct these questions back to
Paul or Tree or somebody on the AM side. Our, our response is we don't know
all these people. Right?
Rakesh26:10
No.
Bill26:14
I mean it's, it's been on my risk register every Wednesday. When you get on
the call with Paul on the all IT connect, it's the first bullet item is AM
needs to provide me with the people who are going to be part of uat.
Rakesh26:31
So those calls, Bill, the ones that we've been having as alignment calls
with Gokul and Sriram and others, we identified all the function leads and
these names all tag to those function leads. The double click into that
was, you know, if it's not Jerry, let's say, you know, Michael Griffith or
maybe wrong names I'm choosing here. But you know, who would be the hands
on keyboard? So would Sriram be able to answer that? I know coming out of
the function calls last week we said we'd get those names. So not
collectively, we'll have those names ready. So I think she's going to want
those names. She's already wanting those names. So if the answer is we need
to have a call with Sriram for everything we discussed and say, okay, get
me a name of a tester for each one of these Function leads or go to these
function leads and get me a name for the tester, then that's what we need
to do.
Bill27:24
I mean, the only person that was very responsive was.
Audrey27:27
I think the key issue Bill is highlighting it's across us. Right. Not only
for manufacturing or planning. When I've been kind of, you know, I did send
you and Paul a note too, Right.
Rakesh27:38
Because we have a tax.
Audrey27:40
That's an example. I have a few other areas too, right. Where our team
members. And then Vikram too. Right. It reached out to the tax leads who
are currently supported, I mean supported the previous project like from
Mexico, Romania. And now when we reached out to them, they said, hey, look,
I'm not going with Athens. I don't know who needs to be involved for
testing the tax application.
Rakesh28:01
Understood, Understood.
Audrey28:02
Right. Send an email to you and Paul. But then I never got any help. I see.
I'm not pointing anyone.
Rakesh28:06
No, no, no. Understood, understood.
Bill28:08
But I think what I point, Let me, let me say this though, Rakesh, is they
point the fingers at it. When the business doesn't provide what they're
supposed to provide us to help, we're the ones getting yelled at right now.
Rakesh28:19
Understood, Understood. So Bill, let me, let me turn that around. I think
what Suka is not blaming us, then let me put on her hat. I think she's,
she's. I know, I know it's coming across because she got her ass chewed up
by Jeff on Friday. But the point she was trying to make is who do I need to
lean in for you guys to get you the names? I need to react to something
that says you're 90% filled up and you've got gaps in 10% of the areas. Let
me get my minions here, you know, the Vicky and Jessica, to start chasing
this for you and get this gaps closed in the next day or so.
Joe28:53
Your comment, I agree with you. Right. And your comment needs to be, you
know, we need to be candid. Say we've asked for the names. We haven't
received all the names yet. We're waiting. We don't know who to reach out
to directly. We're a corporate function that hasn't worked with AM on
projects like this for a while. Therefore, we need a lead from AM that will
reach out to all the different functions and get the tester's name and they
have to report out on it in the meetings.
Rakesh29:29
Yeah. And I think that's the gap. Right. So Pierce was the ua, is the UAT
coordinator, but unfortunately he's not available. So Jessica is stepping
In. So I think what Sukai, then Joe will look for is a table of sorts.
Joe29:41
Jessica is not an AM person, is she?
Rakesh29:43
No, she's not. She's just a program manager that's stepping in for Sukai.
So. But what she can do is kind of, you know, hunt this to ground and say,
okay, I've got these 20 function leads. Let me go chase them to get names
of key on keyboard for each of these areas. Now if you've got 95% of it
done and the other five, give me the table that has, you know, everything.
Let me close the gap. Gaps. So I think we need to be able to give her that
table. And so I think how can we get that table? What you're doing there,
you're in the.
Joe30:15
Position that you'll do most of the talking, right? Is that right, based on
your role for tomorrow's call?
Rakesh30:22
Yes, But I'm also in the position that I have to run this to ground for
her, so I need to chase this as well. So.
Joe30:31
But the call we have today is with Sukai, or is it.
Rakesh30:34
Oh, no, no, no. This is with the Jessica and this is an end of day or a
midday touch point with Jessica and Vicky. I think Vicki is being brought
in for communications because what Sukai told us this morning is she wants
all the names so that Vicki can start communicating with them and prepping
them and saying this is what's coming and be prepared and yada, yada, yada.
Joe30:53
So I think we have. I think we have a game plan then. Deal. I Just one
clarification in my head. When we said we need users if we go with era
isn't the regression testing team uses jira. So why do we need users for
that? We go that route.
Rakesh31:11
I. It's a clarification on my end is that if the regression testing team
already has the names or they are the names.
Joe31:19
They are the names.
Rakesh31:20
Then we should just get those names. If it's too people in that team, we
should put the 2D guys.
Joe31:26
I'm not at. I'm not at this detail all the time. So I forget. But the way I
remember it is the regression test is a team that does the regression
testing for the production environments and they run it frequently and they
have a list of defined company codes, plants, sales orgs, whatever. And
they run the same scripts over and over again. And I believe they're using
eru.
Bill31:52
Yes, they're using Tosca.
Joe31:55
They're using. The regression testing team is using Tosca.
Bill31:58
Correct.
Joe32:00
Oh, so it's just the Deployment team that has never used Tosca.
Bill32:05
100% correct.
Joe32:06
Okay, I didn't get that. So then who's using Europe normally?
Audrey32:12
To be honest, no one is using the. Right. This closet.
Bill32:16
Not on this project.
Joe32:17
Yeah, I mean like getting the scripts from Europe. Right.
Bill32:21
Well, you know, I mean we've got our library of scripts that we, you know
that we would normally load into. You know that look just like this, you
know, this is a. And it tells me what I'm doing. This is 1014 buying from
4050 via internal stock transfer or high international STO for this
material and then every step along the way to make that happen. Okay,
right. And we have those, you know, this is a proper end to end script, you
know and then the HPQC ones we also have, you know, like this. You remember
these Joe and you know who this, this guy's on my team now. Mohan, you
know, built this one, you know, for an order to cash them. This goes all
the way through every.
Joe33:03
But this is what the user. This is what the user would do. They would have
to go through this rip and do all these steps. Right?
Bill33:08
Correct. Exactly. You know, Tony Rose is going to run FB03 to make sure the
FI post.
Joe33:15
That's never going to happen. That's never going to happen.
Bill33:18
I agree. I mean.
Joe33:19
All right, so just getting the right name.
Rakesh33:23
They're not very well organized over there.
Bill33:25
You know, they tell me this is the guy.
Audrey33:57
It.
Bill34:25
And when it's going to be done. These are all these to create all the
outputs that we need.
Rakesh34:31
We could go away.
Bill34:38
Those outputs, these are all. You see there's a lot. All these different
outputs we need. You know, we're gonna have it change from Honeywell to
Solstice.
Joe34:51
Well, this is in Excel somewhere. So this is just going to get copied and
you put a link to it.
Bill34:56
Yep. Your nuggets here you have one more.
Joe35:07
Okay. All right.
Audrey35:14
So it's coming together from our side location. I think just for tomorrow's
closer that way.
Rakesh35:20
So yeah, for tomorrow she's going to want that matrix of the table by what
you just showed earlier. She's wanting, she's. She'll want to know the
names against those. So if there are gaps.
Audrey35:35
I have something like this. Let me quickly flash my screen. Okay. I have
put together. I have a. This.
Joe35:43
I got a drop. I got a drop. But if we have to regroup Sunday tomorrow,
let's, let's do that.
Rakesh35:49
Okay.
Joe35:50
And don't talk too much on all these different areas. I think Rakesh,
you're going to have the notes to kick it off and do the bullet points
going through like we discussed and then after say you know, five minutes
or so, then the rest of us jump in, I mean like and add some color where we
need to.
Rakesh36:17
Okay, let's do that. I will send you the bullet points to the scene so we
can align on the talking points as well. But yeah, so yeah, perfect. So
this would be great I think for tomorrow and I think we'll review this with
Jessica and the team later this afternoon is have this view and say okay,
these are the leads, these are the business teams and where you have red
gaps, this is where I need you to go. Chase.
Audrey36:42
Yes, yes.
Rakesh36:44
So I think if we do something similar for erp then that's what we'll need
to give her Bill a little bit more. So we'll give that team tomorrow. Oh I
got you something. We'll have one for finance and one for er.
Bill37:00
Yeah, zero sugar.
Rakesh37:02
Right. So that's the one. One action there. I think the other piece that
she mentioned was I thought you would think it was sweet summary view if I
got you one that had sugar and you'd be like the by work stream identify
the mechanism of testing. So for each of those areas you've mentioned there
you may be able to add a couple, couple of columns there. Srinivas and Bill
on Is this being done in manually? Is this being done in Tosca? Will
defects be tracked JIRA manually Excel? Will it be tracked and reported out
of Tosca? Is this fully automated? Is this semi automated? I think we may
just need to qualify those for those same areas on the right hand side of
your tracker.
Audrey37:47
So for finance I think it's going to be why manual and Excel.
Rakesh37:54
So if you can add those two columns and copy paste that same across all
those rows that would help. And then Bill we would need something similar
for erp.
Bill38:05
Well it probably should look the same. I mean I have Srinivas will be kind
enough to share his.
Rakesh38:10
Yeah, I think you've shared it with Audrey, right?
Audrey38:12
Yes I do.
Rakesh38:14
Okay, so Audrey with. So can you share the full link please? Sorry Audrey,
go ahead.
Audrey38:22
But Audrey, what I'll do is I'll just export into an Excel and share it. I
don't want this to be messed up. Understood.
Rakesh38:30
We won't work in it. We just need a sample to replicate.
Audrey38:33
Cop I'm going to send this.
Rakesh38:36
Okay, so what we'll then do coming into the 3pm is create Audrey a similar
view on the ERP side. Working with Bill and Add those columns in there as
to, you know, where will be run out of, you know, is it automated? Fully
automated, semi automated, manual. And then, you know, run example. Right,
A fully automated run out of Tosca. And then the second column would be
defect management and tracking is in Tosca or, you know, in Excel or
outside the tool, etc. Right. So just, I presume it'll still be a copy
paste for you as well as to, you know, whatever one area you have, you'll
probably do the same for all. But if there are exceptions, then, you know,
we can, we can talk about those.
Bill39:22
Sounds good to me.
Andre39:24
Yep, sounds good.
Rakesh39:26
Okay. And I think the third piece, which I don't think we have an answer
on, but perhaps it is from this is once you have the teams we also need. So
for finance, those business teams, are the testers there, Srinivas?
Audrey39:43
Yes, that's correct.
Rakesh39:45
Okay, now, Audrey and Bill for erp, the testers will be the regression
team. Are we able to get names of the regression team? Okay, so can we put
that against your areas and say for these areas, these would be. You may
have regional names, you may have multiple names. So just dump that hole.
Because I think what they want to do is again, as I mentioned earlier,
Vicky wants to start reaching out and saying, heads up, you'll be testing
this in this window, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Bill40:26
So we work hard on getting all this done. You know, we will have it done
within the next couple of days. So by the time we meet with her on Friday,
midday for y' all, morning for me, you know, the fire should be put out.
Rakesh40:39
I would hope so. But given we're meeting with her every day and with her
other team members twice a day after that.
Bill40:48
When are you going to get the work done?
Rakesh40:49
Yeah, so. So we'll have to at least provide incremental progress updates
throughout the day. So. So let's see where we are. We can, we can say we're
80% there and we're closing the gap over the next day, or if Jessica wants
to lean in and chase people to close the names out, be our guest. Right.
Bill41:06
So, yeah, that's the one area we can't make a promise on. So I think AM is
going to provide us with business people.
Rakesh41:14
So she's going to. Already she's reached out saying some of these names are
wrong and etc. So I think we need to, we need to get a handle on that one.
That one's probably gonna, my opinion, gonna blow up because Jessica's
already reaching out to the names on, you know, the conversations we had
with words.
Bill41:34
But the blowback has to go back towards the AM business people who provide
us those names in the first place.
Rakesh41:39
Yes.
Bill41:40
Not you, not me and not trainee box.
Rakesh41:44
Yeah, because the people on that calls said these names.
Bill41:47
So we have to. We only can work with what they give us.
Joe41:51
Yep.
Bill41:53
If that's the wrong folks, then we're not going to have good validation. Or
in Srinivas's case, he's not gonna have good testing.
Rakesh42:02
So. All right, so those were the asks. Let's regroup. I think we meet with
them shortly, but then for others we regroup at 3:30 as well. So.
Audrey42:12
Rakesh, quick. Sorry.
Rakesh42:13
Yes.
Audrey42:14
Just need 10 seconds. Let me flash my screen. Is this what you're looking
for now?
Rakesh42:21
Yeah. Okay, so if you can add a couple of. I'm just going to zoom into your
screen here, couple of other columns on, you know, UAT.
Joe42:33
Yeah.
Rakesh42:35
Right. Manual and then UAT defects, tracker, Excel files stored in a
SharePoint. She may want to link to that SharePoint because she's in the
mood for double and triple clicking.
Audrey42:46
So just so you know, I have that link. Okay. I can probably paste that.
Rakesh42:54
Access. No access. No. We're trying to provide her a view that we have
structure to this, that we've got this access to what? Whatever link it is,
she may not have access to that SharePoint. Right. They can handle
requests, et cetera.
Audrey43:10
I need to probably talk to them first and provide them access. I don't want
to.
Joe43:14
Understood.
Rakesh43:15
No, no, no, understood. My point more importantly was to give them the
structure that hey, this is thorough, we're tracking defects, it's in a
structured manner. At this link, they can poke holes at it later on, but at
least we are showing the first level of it saying, listen, this is
structured, we have a link. We're doing this. And they can say as to the
adequacy of how you're running your defects, different story, but at least
it's there. Right. So when you say stored in a SharePoint, she will ask me
link to the SharePoint. So I'm just indicating, you might as well just post
a link here whether she has access or not.
Audrey43:52
Fair point. So yeah, I'm gonna copy paste now.
Bill43:55
But I mean they do realize there won't be anything in the UAT defect
tracker because we have to agree, agree, agree.
Rakesh44:02
In your case, if everything the reporting is coming out of Tosca. So she's
already requested. Jessica and Vicki have requested access to Tosca and
they want access to the database, because they want to start understanding
what sort of structure and reporting is there and whether that will suffice
for all their reporting that they need. So just as an FYI. So, yeah, so in
your case, Audrey, if you're preparing something similar, then your defect
tracker is, you know, if you have a link to Tosca, Bill, or the defect
tracker in Tosca. Just.
Bill44:34
I don't have. I don't have access to Tosca. None of my team does.
Rakesh44:38
Okay.
Bill44:39
You know, the Tosca team puts the reports and the outputs and the steps in
the Solstice Outputs folder.
Rakesh44:48
Ah, okay, then let' do that.
Bill44:50
I'm gonna put that link.
Rakesh44:51
Yes, yes, yes.
Bill44:53
All the answers to all the questions.
Rakesh44:56
Perfect. So if they want to double click, they can go.
Bill44:59
Yeah, they can click, they can dance around, you know, they can decide, you
know, if the scripts look fancy enough, you know, I challenge them, you
know.
Rakesh45:11
Yeah. I mean, if it's the wrong T code there.
Bill45:15
I mean, are you the expert?
Rakesh45:16
Right. I think they're looking for consistency.
Bill45:19
So even, you know, these are pretty fancier than, you know, the normal ones
that we have. You know, the XL one that I shared, I mean, this is, you
know, shows the step and it shows the screenshot from SAP.
Rakesh45:32
Nice.
Bill45:32
Of what we're doing here. I think this is better than what Jira. Jira is
just really a consolidation of spreadsheets. This shows, you know, what the
script actually is running.
Rakesh45:44
Okay.
Bill45:45
All the way through, you know, so that's great. We haven't tested them all
yet. You know, as I showed you the schedule, we won't be done testing for
another 10 days. That's within our window to be done testing. So we're not
behind. In fact, this is going to accelerate us.
Rakesh46:00
No good. I'm with you. I think it's just communicating that to her properly
and we will continue to do that. So, Audrey, my ask then is take all this
information and put it in the similar links whether they have access or
not. But it at least provides a structure that satisfies their ask for
tomorrow morning.
Andre46:21
Sounds good.
Rakesh46:23
And then I think we'll talk to Jessica in an hour and then later at 4pm
again and we'll see, you know, what comes of it. So.
Joe46:31
Cool.
Bill46:31
That's good.
Rakesh46:32
All righty, thanks. All.
Bill46:35

iscussed</h2><h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75re=
m">1. Preparation and Roll-Up of UAT Test Scripts and Trackers</h3><ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Summary Preparation</strong>: Andre =
and Bill are working to prepare a summary for UAT (User Acceptance Testing)=
. Andre has a draft and has consolidated test scripts from different folder=
s and teams using test script documentation.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Required Components</strong>: The su=
mmary must include the number of test cases, hyperlinks to access these scr=
ipts, and a list of UAT team members.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Division of Trackers</strong>: Rakes=
h=E2=80=99s team has prepared two trackers:<ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">BRB Readiness Tracker:</strong> Spli=
t into Finance and Non-Finance (ERP and non-ERP).</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Missing Data:</strong> Some sections=
 of the tracker need to be populated before sharing further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Hyperlinks &amp; Details</strong>: H=
yperlinks must point to detailed scripts, mostly stored in SharePoint, acce=
ssible via links in the summary tables.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">2. Ownersh=
ip, Script Format, and Tools</h3><ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Script Creation Ownership</strong>: =
Functional teams in IT created and loaded the test scripts; Andre consolida=
ted these summaries for management review.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Script Format</strong>: Debate over =
script formats and adequacy, with frustration expressed that not all script=
s fit the standard or show sufficient end-to-end detail.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Tools Used</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Tosca</strong>: Preferred testing au=
tomation tool as per Sukai=E2=80=99s latest ask, although it=E2=80=99s new =
to some deployment teams.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Jira</strong>: Traditional tool, mor=
e familiar to the team, still used for regression and defect management.</l=
i>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Excel</strong>: For consolidating an=
d linking data and manual tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Automation vs. Manual Testing</stron=
g>: Concerns discussed about reliance on Tosca (risk of the unfamiliar), wi=
th fallback options to use regression scripts from Jira if Tosca falters.</=
li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">3. Concern=
s over Test Script Readiness and Requirements</h3><ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Timing Issues</strong>: The team cou=
ld not meet same-day requests due to time difference with the Indian team a=
nd incomplete deliverables.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Expectations for Friday</strong>: Th=
ere&#39;s a hard deadline to be fully ready for the Friday status call with=
 Sukai.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Management Demands</strong>: Sukai (=
and Jeff above her) are asking for &quot;double and triple click&quot; tran=
sparency=E2=80=94i.e., the ability to drill into testing details down to in=
dividual scripts, names, and process steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">4. Team Me=
mber Identification and Responsibilities</h3><ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key Issue</strong>: Gaps in identify=
ing hands-on UAT testers for each functional area. Many names given are fun=
ction leads, but Sukai wants confirmed &quot;hands on keyboard&quot; people=
 for actual test execution.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Responsibility</strong>: It&#39;s re=
peatedly noted that IT and corporate functions cannot supply business-side =
testers=E2=80=99 names; this is a business/AM (Advanced Materials) responsi=
bility.<ul>
<li>Jessica and Vicki are tasked to =E2=80=9Cchase=E2=80=9D business teams =
to fill staffing gaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Table of Roles</strong>: The need fo=
r a structured matrix listing: workstream, responsible leads, and actual te=
sters=E2=80=94with gaps clearly indicated for business-side follow-up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">5. Reporti=
ng, Transparency, and Defect Tracking</h3><ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">PowerBI Dashboard</strong>: Rakesh=
=E2=80=99s team is developing a dashboard for executive visibility, with dr=
ill-down capability.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Defect Tracking</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Finance:</strong> Manual/Excel-based=
, with SharePoint links to trackers.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">ERP:</strong> Ideally reported from =
Tosca or via automated reports/output folders, as no direct access for all =
teams to Tosca.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Request for Linking:</strong> Even i=
f links to SharePoint or Tosca are not operational for all, providing them =
demonstrates structured tracking and satisfies management=E2=80=99s documen=
tation asks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">6. Immedia=
te Next Steps for Upcoming Meetings</h3><ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">1:30 PM and 4:00 PM Calls:</strong> =
Progress check-in with Jessica and Vicki to review status and share updated=
 matrices, bullet points, and summary views. </li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Tomorrow=E2=80=99s Report-out</stron=

prepared by Rakesh and team. One is about the BRB readiness. Right. One is =
for finance and non finance. I think he created one. This is for ERP and th=
is for non erp. If I open this right. I mean any one of them. Right. I just=
. Let me open this. I think the ask from this spreadsheet is to populate so=
me missing information that Rakesh has put together. So I think for which w=
e have a call at 1:30. Right. So I&#39;m not worried about this on this cal=
l. Right. So then our key focus should be for the request that did come in =
today&#39;s meeting. So What I did. So again this I focused with finance ri=
ght after my call from Sukai. So what I did, I have listed down my work str=
eams within Finance. Right. Then I have captured number of test scripts tha=
t we have aligned in most of the except Tax and Work UI which we&#39;re wor=
king on. So we have these test scripts and we know what are those test scri=
pts are referring to. Right. Then there&#39;s a hyperlink. If you click on =
this, it takes them to the SharePoint which will then provide the detailed =
script information. Obviously they will definitely go through that, but for=
 them. Coming back to our summary for who did that?</div></div><div style=
