*End of Summary*
=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Anna0:00
You are now connected.
Rob0:01
You can merge your calls when ready and we may have to try to find another
time for this call in future weeks. All right, well maybe we'll go ahead
and get started here and hopefully Mahalo or Preetha can join shortly. I'll
go ahead and share. So the purpose of this call this call is going to be a
weekly touch point for our leaders within the contracts work stream,
specifically those that are the heads of end to end processes. So 3 ROM for
order to cash, DJ Daniel for direct procurement, procure to pay, Anna for
indirect and Jason and others kind of for our STO, ISE, planning,
logistics, etc. And I know that we had shown that shown that governance
slide last week. Happy to review that at the end here if folks are
interested. And I think the goal here is that this is just going to be time
for us to align on plant plan priorities for the week. Today we're going to
spend a couple minutes on cutover work plan approach and align on some key
upcoming meetings this week. So for a summary at a high level, last note is
that we do have finance included, it included and trade compliance included
as well just since those are functions that will often impact cross all of
our processes. So I think two updates for this week that I think folks have
already heard with regard to go live timing. Ireland is delayed until 8:25.
I know that we're going to have a separate discussion later this week. The
SRIRAM and I are coordinating for delayed countries as well as a discussion
on impact the countries that close. Saudi Arabia is also targeted for 929
and as is UAE. Unless there's any other updates from anyone on the calls,
those will be taken into separate discussions. And where we'll spend a
little time today is just talking about our steps for work plan development
for cutover. That's going to be a cross functional work plan that covers
not only of all of our end to end processes but all of our functions that
are driving actions that are occurring leading up to or at 8.1. So I think
some key priorities for the group this week, work plan development we're
looking to have again we'll go through that in a little bit separately, but
we're looking to have drafts by the end of week of key milestones with the
plans finalized by end of next week and that's advanced in advance of the
BRB that's on 625. So we'll want to make sure that we have those in place
in terms of cutover Key reporting APIs we've received those from AR and
ISC. They filled that out in the tracker. But we still need input from
Procurement, ap, CX and Sales. For CX and Sales, we've aligned on them
offline, imported them in. But we'll just need C ROM or Mahala or others to
review and confirm. So maybe for this group, I don't know if Daniel, if you
had a chance to look at that KPI tracker that was sent out last Monday and
if that's something that in the next couple days maybe you could take back
to DJ and you guys still aligned on inputs for.
Jesus4:24
Did we ever explain what was needed for that? Yeah, the concept is kind of
KPI tracker.
Rob4:35
We did. We can pull it up here quickly. That would be helpful. Chris, do
you happen to have that up? Pull it up and I think you can filter out those
ones at the bottom that I think are a little bit different. So in short,
these are going to be the metrics by which we're using both leading up to
8.1 to track how we're moving towards cutover as well as after 8. 1. So for
CX for example, some of the milestones that we've aligned on or had
discussed are, you know, number one, number of customers that have updated
their systems and are set to receive orders on 8.1. A second one is going
to be, that's going to be tracked in Salesforce's number of customers that
I've indicated that they will not be willing to accept three way mismatches
or invoices coming from the new legal entity after 8. 1. So these are just
metrics that we'll be able to use, you know, prior to 8. 1. And then after
8. 1 there's going to be some such as, you know, number of open orders
remaining in an old legal entity, etc. That the team's going to use for
tracking. So our request was by last Friday to to get a summary of what
those are, how the information will be pulled so that hopefully moving into
next week we can make sure that we have the right system dashboard approach
set up so we can start tracking.
Jesus6:23
Does that make sense? Jesus. So is there anything that you guys, you know,
would be looking at before cutover that help, you know, if you're on track
or not?
John6:38
Yeah, I'm sure there are some things we can add here. I'll need to get with
D.J. i had not seen this if it went to Daniel, he's out this week. So Rob,
if you can maybe send whatever you send to Daniel my way and I'LL make sure
to get with DJ and start working on this.
Rob6:57
Great, thank you. And likewise, you know, Anna, from an indirect
standpoint, is this something that you all have spoken about as well yet?
Anna7:17
Yes. We still have two things, I guess. Well, a couple of things that we
had to clarify after the call with Joe with finance and with legal, but
yes, for the rest were aligned.
Rob7:32
Okay, great. Yeah. Maybe if we could. Even if, even if there's still some
nuances of. If we can kind of figure out what those indicators are, maybe
we can set a time frame by, you know, by end of day tomorrow or Wednesday.
I think that would help us kind of move forward with thinking through how
we, how we can set up some of these reporting dashboards. Great. All right.
We'll take an action to make sure to share that out with this group. All
right, so I will go back to sharing here for finalizing key minus states. I
think we, we. I know, Jason. We spoke a little bit about this Friday and I
think we're nearly there with us. I think we, like verbally spoke through
it. I think we'll just need to get those dates finalized early this week.
So if you have a chance to maybe look at that.
Jesus8:39
I'm fine with what they sent.
Rob8:40
Okay.
Jesus8:41
For stos, and it mirrors the sales order process.
Rob8:46
Right, Great. We'll include that in the notes that we sent out today just
because we have, I think, cross functional representation on the invite for
this meeting and, and ask folks to, to provide any disagreements or
concerns, you know, by end of day Wednesday. And then I think likewise.
Anna, there's. I don't. I know that we had. If. I know that there's some
nuance about, you know, whether we're going to be reissuing or issuing PO
amendments underway. But I think the question of. I think you've probably
seen for some of the other order types like sales orders or direct pos, you
know, we have last PO issue date, last invoice date, last year date. We're
just hoping to. To get those same for indirect. So I don't know what's
best. Is it better to set up a meeting or if it's better just to send you a
table and can have you populate? Happy to do whatever. Whatever works best.
Anna9:51
I'm okay to copy and take inspiration from the direct side as well. My only
concern is we need a freeze window because on my fmea, I've also tracked a
concern that I will have purchase requisitions that are not approved that
may be stuck in flight.
Jesus10:04
Right.
Anna10:05
And again, Only for the rename and reuse entities. But taking into account
that for me that's 84% of my open POS, especially HQ is a concern. So in
that particular case, I would recommend to have at least a window of a week
for indirect to stop transacting. But that also relies on alignment with
the approvers to make sure that any in flight purchase requisition either
gets cleared or it will be canceled after the soft spin date because we
can't manage the ones stuck in flight mode.
Rob10:40
Got it. Yeah. I think that there is enough difference between direct,
because direct is not doing any freeze at all that I think it would be good
to have a short, even 15 minute call on this. I think we probably need to
have this before the APAC workshop, which is Wednesday night eastern time
or Thursday morning, their local time. Do you think you'd be able to
propose maybe a time period that works and then I can include it or you
know, anyone else from controllership as well that you think would be
needed?
Anna11:16
I can come back to you on that one, Rob. But my proposal is one week before
the soft spin date and.
Rob11:23
Right.
Anna11:24
We can accommodate exceptional orders. So if it's urgent repairs for the
sites. Yes, they will be accommodated, but we have ways to mitigate that.
They can set up blanket fields for recurring repairs. Right. Or leverage P
cards. So for indirect, it should be a week.
Rob11:39
Okay. Yeah, sounds good. We'll. We'll pre populate that. With that
assumption. I just want to make sure that there's nothing that we're. We're
missing and you know, I think there's probably a couple other dates there
too. Thank you.
Anna11:53
Sorry I didn't cut it like that, Rob, but I'm actually traveling this week.
It's a bank holiday today too. I logged in to make sure everything's fine,
but I'll be stuck in training for the next couple of days and they're
confiscating laptops and phones, so I will only have them very early
morning or very late at night. But I will definitely come back.
Rob12:11
Okay. Yeah. And I'm happy to do a super early meeting or whatever works
best for you. Great. Okay.
Jesus12:21
Were you looking for approval or anything for the one week? Are you good?
Anna12:27
I'm actually. I would prefer not to. Because if we can.
Jesus12:32
Approval or. What would you prefer?
Anna12:34
I prefer not allow exceptions. I would prefer to request alignment. With
Rajeev, with you and with Jonathan, if that's okay.
Jesus12:42
Yeah.
Anna12:42
With the cap that. That critical orders we will accommodate. Okay. So if
it's anything that holds production because that was my concern as well. If
it's anything that holds production, if it is urgent equipment repairs, we
will accommodate that. And better yet, I was actually intending to align
with Candace and the sourcing teams on staying ahead of that because we
have a lot of blanket POS with Turner, for example with our maintenance
providers. Right. To be able to those. But yes, we will accommodate the
urgent ones. If you have concerns about the one week window, we can
definitely that but that would again only be for the rename and reuse
entities.
Rob13:23
Yep.
Jesus13:24
I'll send the John, I'll do you a favor since you don't have much of a
thing. I'll. I'll send Rajeev and Jonathan a message CCU and let's just get
that done for clarity. I would expect. I'm hoping that you would help with
communications regarding this. Right.
Anna13:41
Yes, absolutely. And I will. And I'll actually align with DJ next week and
we'll draft an emergency sourcing channel that the sites can reach out to
if that is needed during that one week.
Jesus13:55
Got it.
Rob13:58
All right, thanks both Next is just for these upcoming workshops. As
mentioned, we have the APAC one which is going to be Wednesday evening. The
cutover portion starts at 9:45pm so apologies to those for east coast and
Steven. I don't know. Do you want to does it make sense to have a separate
meeting just talking coverage or. I think folks are aligned. I think it's
going to be me, you, Sriram, Jason, Anna and then someone from direct.
Jesus14:40
Yep, we're good.
Rob14:42
Okay. And I think. I think we're aligned on materials. I. I know Anna, you
sent the reply back that you were kind of good with the slides. I just want
to you know, you did see the indirect slide where we're using for that
workshop, the one with and I can flash it up here quickly but the one with
like the scenario tree, it's a.
Anna15:11
I can share the executive summary, so or better yet, Rob Purul can share
the executive summary because that's the one that we put up for Torsten as
well. It's one slider and it actually has a summary of scenarios. I think
it's enough to use for indirect if you're okay with that. We actually have
two text summary and one is the timeline.
Rob15:28
Okay. I may steal yours. The view that we currently have the scenario tree,
I think for indirect specifically is a little unruly. So I think for
indirect we will take the exact summary that you provide. So thank you
please.
Anna15:44
Sure. And we also have the FMEA Updated. Right. If you want to merge that
with the direct and the rest of the teams just to keep a centralized
tracker and PRU can definitely share that.
Rob15:54
Okay. I don't think we're going to do the FMEA in the workshop, but yes,
I'll reach out to Bruce to get a copy of that. So far we've only been
having access to the rail, and I think the FMEA would be great. So thank
you. Okay, next is for Japan. So as folks know, Japan is a reverse carb. We
know that at least based on the current financials, we don't see any sales.
But we've been having trouble trying to identify kind of like who the right
points of contact would be to help kind of confirm the order volume and
scope. I know on the, like, I think, and I don't know this has came up at
all in your discussion, but for Japan, you know, we're expecting there's
going to be some indirect orders that are Honeywell orders within, you
know, within, you know, not the CIP 900, but, you know, the Honeywell ERP
that need to get moved back, you know, to the Japan Honeywell entity.
Anna17:07
Where are they today? So if it's, if it's a. Are they today in.
Rob17:11
So in, in C100, they're. No, they're. So today they're in. Their current
company code is. It's like 3691 BRP and then like 381A ERP. So again, it's
the, the legal entity in Japan, Honeywell Japan Ltd. They're going, it's of
a transfer back. They're going to be transferring out the activity that's
Honeywell to Honeywell GK and then the, the Honeywell Japan Limited will
just go with the transaction. So everything else that we're doing, you
know, we're moving solstice activity. This is moving Honeywell activity
back. So I, I think, I think that we've just had a little trouble
identifying, you know, who can kind of help, you know, you know, identify
what the activity is and what the actions is. Because I think our current
team today is obviously focused on the Athens activity.
Anna18:15
Well, for indirect. Yes, I can, I can share two names. We would need
someone from legal or from controllership to guide us exactly what they
need to, to filter on. But definitely that would be Tracy Huang. You have
her name, because I've also delegated her for the workshop. And, and Hans
Shen, he's our senior director for indirect procurement. They can take the
lead.
Rob18:36
Great. I will get 15 minutes set up with both of them tomorrow morning.
Because I know the. In the indirect workshop, that's a risk and an open
item they brought up. And I think, you know, in. I think we just want to be
able to confirm that we don't see any activity and Jesus. I assume the same
on the direct side. I don't think it would be. I don't know if it would be
you, but I think we're just trying to confirm that we don't see any direct
activity in these two entity codes and we can put them in the chat here.
Sure. Yep.
Anna19:12
Do you have other entities? Do you have other reverse cards?
Rob19:16
No, only one.
Anna19:19
Okay, clear. Thank you.
Rob19:25
And again, so here we'll not be looking for Athens activity, we're going to
be looking for any other RemainCo Honeywell activity. Okay. Sorry, Jason.
No, I didn't say anything. Okay. Yeah. And likewise, if there's any STOs.
Right. That are currently going to from these, we'll need to confirm that
we have the right person as well. Okay. In the interest of time, I'm just
going to keep, keep moving here. I'm going to be short on this because
we're having separate follow up meetings by function and I want to make
sure we get to a couple other things. But the high level summary is that
we've drafted a template for functions that input cut over work plans that
is going to summarize their activities that are needed that are needed to
occur in order to facilitate cutover of open orders, SOS, POS, et cetera.
On 8 1, you'll see from our fund diagram in the bottom the red dotted box.
This is going to be managed outside of Capital Edge. There's going to be
some overlap in milestones that you know us as the cutover team that we're
going to manually make sure stay aligned with some milestones and Capital
Edge for reporting purposes. So there's the Thursday LES legal entity
meetings that occur once a week. There are going to be some milestones that
we pull from the work plan to help support for reporting for les. But for
this group, at least as of now, that's not something the team needs to
worry about. The focus is going to be developing kind of the key activities
for this work plan. You know, so these are going to be everything from
items related to sales order, purchase order, SEO cutover activities
related to, you know, ramp up or ramp down of activity prior to 81 order
cleanup, order tracking and reporting. I think what will ultimately be kind
of the most important products will be the specific activities that are
happening day by day, hour by hour leading up to the eight. One legal
entity go live. Any system setup or configuration changes, any incremental
support being in place, trainings, FAQs, transition to hypercare and
country specific considerations. As of now, we're trying to operate with a
single work plan. We may for several countries have to split that out by
country. But at least for the development progress process we're working
through now, we're looking for teams to help us populate one plan with a
target for countries go live of 8. 1. So we'll set up additional
discussions here to talk through some of these pieces with the functions.
We have the meeting on Friday, we have procurement and the planning FCO
meeting scheduled for tomorrow or sorry for Wednesday and the the finance
session scheduled for tomorrow as well.
Jesus22:48
A couple of notes team so specifically asked Rob and Thanks Rob. Putting
together the template but we wanted to keep this out of Capital Edge. I
think we found that Capital Edge is not very wieldy, doesn't allow for us
to work fluidly. So we're trying to make this tool work for you. This, what
you document in here should be absolutely no different than what you
believe you need to properly manage this transition. So if there is, if
there's missing information here that you want added, please speak up. If
there's too much information in here, please speak up.
Rob23:32
Right.
Jesus23:32
This needs to be our. We do this well, right? There's one plan documented
in one place that we can all use to execute. So please make this yours.
This is not, this is not an additional ad. This needs to be the tool that
you guys help use to manage how we're going to get through this transition.
Rob24:01
Thanks. And just to add on that, we've tried to pre populate some
milestones based on what we've heard in discussions. But you know, if the
team looks at it and says, hey, these don't really. This is not the most
effective way to think about it. Feel free to, you know, feel free to do,
you know, whatever the key activities and whatever the right approaches to.
Jesus24:20
Help effectively and I think to make sure that we don't have excessive
documentation. Robin.
Rob24:26
Right.
Jesus24:26
That the T minus schedule should feed into this, right? Yes, I think
eventually.
Rob24:32
Right.
Jesus24:33
The T minus schedule, guys, was for us to think through the various
milestones that need to happen on precise specific dates. Once you have
those, they should fold into this and then whatever was previously
documented for T minus schedule would then become obsolete.
Rob24:50
Yeah, exactly. So our hope and our goal, and we've tried to put in that
into the plan already, items like last, you know, PO creation date, et
cetera. Our goal is to essentially, you know, in the next couple weeks, you
know, move out a lot, you know, close out a lot of our rail actions. And
rather than kind of managing things in the rail, this will kind of
hopefully become, you know, our, our activity list and our work plan list.
Jesus25:17
So between our work plan and then the KPIs. Right. The KPIs should help us
understand if we are prepared for cutover and how well we're doing post
cutover. Between those two things. Those are major mechanisms. We should
have to let us know if we're on plan or not.
Rob25:41
So just kind of looking forward here. I know we're kind of running up
against the end of our time here. You know, again, these are kind of the
high level program managed dates, program management dates. If we think
about from now till close. I think our big focus in this coming week is
going to be on items D, E, F and G. So I'm going to go to a slide in a
second. I think we're nearly there with scenarios. I know that we're going
to have a million exception cases, but there are four or five I think like
key items that I think that we do want to close out this week. So at least
we can say, hey, we have the general base case confirmed and I'll flip the
next slide in a second. Confirming T minus dates for, for indirect, getting
those KPIs aligned on and start starting work plan, work plan tracking. So
on the bottom here, these are kind of the four items for D or the five
items for D that I think we really want to try to close out, you know, this
week. But specifically I think before, before we start these regional
workshops, the first being Wednesday night Eastern time. So maybe just one
update for the group on number two. We did hear feedback from Jason Vavhav
and others that the plan is to not cancel and reissue open STOs that have
not been shipped in the meeting notes that go out today. We're going to
make that clear across functionally and make sure that we don't have any IT
finance, et cetera issues. So I think we have a path forward on that.
Jason, anything you would add?
Jesus27:35
No. Hopeful that no one else finds any issues with it. So.
Rob27:43
For indirect and I think the two. And you let me know if you think there's
other big questions. But I think the two big questions we have on if PO
amendments will be issued in approach for Ivalua.
Anna27:57
Yeah, I don't have a dependency on ivalua. Because strictly for purchase
order management we can just stop using it and pick up maintenance in SAP
directly. The only question is when do we do that? And that's going to be
dependent on the parallel conversations that are related to ivalua. That
seems to be a complex topic.
Rob28:14
Okay so. So for today the key, the key thing that we really need to figure
out is more the PO amendments component.
Anna28:22
Correct. And that's with. And that's with it. That's with Joe. After our
call last week I had a consecutive call with with the operational IT team
and they were the ones that flagged that they've identified some bugs when
they ran some scripts for amendments. So my thought was maybe that's why
Joe was trying to avoid amendments because they had some errors in the
script. My recommendation would be to test it out for the vendor management
database migration. I've already aligned with the teams. There's a one week
dependency where Daniel is helping us. But beyond that we're going to do a,
we're going to do a rehearsal now in June and we're going to simulate
headquarter to headquarter database cloning for the rename we use entity
which is going to give us the lead times of actual execution. Plus we've
also confirmed that the database of corporate vendors doesn't have a
dependency on the soft spin date. So we're going to try to do the
transition before.
Rob29:24
Thanks. I realize we're over time here. I think just last the last two big
items that I think we really just need to make sure that we fully close the
loop on are our finance and trade compliance review across scenarios. I
think that's been a little, a little tough to nail down on both accounts.
We have a finance meeting tomorrow and maybe we'll hear from. I know Martin
and Victoria had raised some of these in a trade compliance call today.
We're planning to raise, you know, just clarifying some scenarios today but
I think, I think getting those cleaned up in the next couple of days will
be critical so we can kind of continue forward with our planning. So any,
anything else Stephen, that you would, you would add for this group.
Jesus30:15
If you look at your calendars for the next couple months. Yes, it's been a
lot of work and yeah, it will be continue to.
Rob30:21
Be a lot of work.
Jesus30:25
Sorry but I think we know what the repercussions can look like if we don't
do this. Well done. Well so.
Rob30:33
Thanks. If anyone is interested in, you know, we'll include the slides that
go out some of the upcoming meetings that we have scheduled for this week.
You'll see there's a good amount on specific topics and rail items, so
please just reach out and we'll get you added. As a reminder, the slides
for the next workshop, which I think is amiable, is due end of day. It was
supposed to be due end of day tomorrow. A lot of these will be the same as
apac, so you'll see some follow ups coming out on those as well. All right,
thank you everyone.

6">You can merge your calls when ready and we may have to try to find anoth=
er time for this call in future weeks. All right, well maybe we&#39;ll go a=
head and get started here and hopefully Mahalo or Preetha can join shortly.=
 I&#39;ll go ahead and share. So the purpose of this call this call is goin=
g to be a weekly touch point for our leaders within the contracts work stre=
am, specifically those that are the heads of end to end processes. So 3 ROM=
 for order to cash, DJ Daniel for direct procurement, procure to pay, Anna =
for indirect and Jason and others kind of for our STO, ISE, planning, logis=
tics, etc. And I know that we had shown that shown that governance slide la=
st week. Happy to review that at the end here if folks are interested. And =
I think the goal here is that this is just going to be time for us to align=
 on plant plan priorities for the week. Today we&#39;re going to spend a co=
uple minutes on cutover work plan approach and align on some key upcoming m=
eetings this week. So for a summary at a high level, last note is that we d=
o have finance included, it included and trade compliance included as well =
just since those are functions that will often impact cross all of our proc=
esses. So I think two updates for this week that I think folks have already=
 heard with regard to go live timing. Ireland is delayed until 8:25. I know=
 that we&#39;re going to have a separate discussion later this week. The SR=
IRAM and I are coordinating for delayed countries as well as a discussion o=
n impact the countries that close. Saudi Arabia is also targeted for 929 an=
d as is UAE. Unless there&#39;s any other updates from anyone on the calls,=
 those will be taken into separate discussions. And where we&#39;ll spend a=
 little time today is just talking about our steps for work plan developmen=
t for cutover. That&#39;s going to be a cross functional work plan that cov=
ers not only of all of our end to end processes but all of our functions th=
at are driving actions that are occurring leading up to or at 8.1. So I thi=
nk some key priorities for the group this week, work plan development we&#3=
9;re looking to have again we&#39;ll go through that in a little bit separa=
tely, but we&#39;re looking to have drafts by the end of week of key milest=
ones with the plans finalized by end of next week and that&#39;s advanced i=
n advance of the BRB that&#39;s on 625. So we&#39;ll want to make sure that=
 we have those in place in terms of cutover Key reporting APIs we&#39;ve re=
ceived those from AR and ISC. They filled that out in the tracker. But we s=
till need input from Procurement, ap, CX and Sales. For CX and Sales, we&#3=
9;ve aligned on them offline, imported them in. But we&#39;ll just need C R=
OM or Mahala or others to review and confirm. So maybe for this group, I do=
n&#39;t know if Daniel, if you had a chance to look at that KPI tracker tha=
t was sent out last Monday and if that&#39;s something that in the next cou=
ple days maybe you could take back to DJ and you guys still aligned on inpu=
ts for.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;background=

;line-height:1.6">We did. We can pull it up here quickly. That would be hel=
pful. Chris, do you happen to have that up? Pull it up and I think you can =
filter out those ones at the bottom that I think are a little bit different=
. So in short, these are going to be the metrics by which we&#39;re using b=
oth leading up to 8.1 to track how we&#39;re moving towards cutover as well=
 as after 8. 1. So for CX for example, some of the milestones that we&#39;v=
e aligned on or had discussed are, you know, number one, number of customer=
s that have updated their systems and are set to receive orders on 8.1. A s=
econd one is going to be, that&#39;s going to be tracked in Salesforce&#39;=
s number of customers that I&#39;ve indicated that they will not be willing=
 to accept three way mismatches or invoices coming from the new legal entit=
y after 8. 1. So these are just metrics that we&#39;ll be able to use, you =
know, prior to 8. 1. And then after 8. 1 there&#39;s going to be some such =
as, you know, number of open orders remaining in an old legal entity, etc. =
That the team&#39;s going to use for tracking. So our request was by last F=
riday to to get a summary of what those are, how the information will be pu=
lled so that hopefully moving into next week we can make sure that we have =
the right system dashboard approach set up so we can start tracking.</div><=

 the high level summary is that we&#39;ve drafted a template for functions =
that input cut over work plans that is going to summarize their activities =
that are needed that are needed to occur in order to facilitate cutover of =
open orders, SOS, POS, et cetera. On 8 1, you&#39;ll see from our fund diag=
ram in the bottom the red dotted box. This is going to be managed outside o=
f Capital Edge. There&#39;s going to be some overlap in milestones that you=
 know us as the cutover team that we&#39;re going to manually make sure sta=
y aligned with some milestones and Capital Edge for reporting purposes. So =
there&#39;s the Thursday LES legal entity meetings that occur once a week. =
There are going to be some milestones that we pull from the work plan to he=
lp support for reporting for les. But for this group, at least as of now, t=
hat&#39;s not something the team needs to worry about. The focus is going t=
o be developing kind of the key activities for this work plan. You know, so=
 these are going to be everything from items related to sales order, purcha=
se order, SEO cutover activities related to, you know, ramp up or ramp down=
 of activity prior to 81 order cleanup, order tracking and reporting. I thi=
nk what will ultimately be kind of the most important products will be the =
specific activities that are happening day by day, hour by hour leading up =
to the eight. One legal entity go live. Any system setup or configuration c=
hanges, any incremental support being in place, trainings, FAQs, transition=
 to hypercare and country specific considerations. As of now, we&#39;re try=
ing to operate with a single work plan. We may for several countries have t=
o split that out by country. But at least for the development progress proc=
ess we&#39;re working through now, we&#39;re looking for teams to help us p=
opulate one plan with a target for countries go live of 8. 1. So we&#39;ll =
set up additional discussions here to talk through some of these pieces wit=
h the functions. We have the meeting on Friday, we have procurement and the=
 planning FCO meeting scheduled for tomorrow or sorry for Wednesday and the=
 the finance session scheduled for tomorrow as well.</div></div><div style=

going to be on items D, E, F and G. So I&#39;m going to go to a slide in a =
second. I think we&#39;re nearly there with scenarios. I know that we&#39;r=
e going to have a million exception cases, but there are four or five I thi=
nk like key items that I think that we do want to close out this week. So a=
t least we can say, hey, we have the general base case confirmed and I&#39;=
ll flip the next slide in a second. Confirming T minus dates for, for indir=
ect, getting those KPIs aligned on and start starting work plan, work plan =
tracking. So on the bottom here, these are kind of the four items for D or =
the five items for D that I think we really want to try to close out, you k=
now, this week. But specifically I think before, before we start these regi=
onal workshops, the first being Wednesday night Eastern time. So maybe just=
 one update for the group on number two. We did hear feedback from Jason Va=
vhav and others that the plan is to not cancel and reissue open STOs that h=
ave not been shipped in the meeting notes that go out today. We&#39;re goin=

 they ran some scripts for amendments. So my thought was maybe that&#39;s w=

database migration. I&#39;ve already aligned with the teams. There&#39;s a =
one week dependency where Daniel is helping us. But beyond that we&#39;re g=
oing to do a, we&#39;re going to do a rehearsal now in June and we&#39;re g=

 we use entity which is going to give us the lead times of actual execution=
