UAT Governance and Cutover Planning Strategy

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Cutover Planning for Sales and Purchase Orders =20
- **Responsibility Split**: Functional (supply chain) teams handle the =
practical aspects of cutting over sales and purchase orders, while =
IT=E2=80=99s main responsibility is to support the systems and application =
ecosystem, especially as legal entity changes impact ERP and related =
systems.
- **Timing and Phasing**:=20
  - Applications are in various =
phases of move/build-back:
    - Some are moving =E2=80=9Cas is=E2=80=9D in=
 June and July.
    - Others (notably 8.1 related) are going live to =
support legal entity readiness.
    - Further cutovers scheduled during =
July, August, September, aiming for completion before October.
  - All applications must be cut over before November 1st to avoid reliance=
 on the TSA (Transition Services Agreement).
- **Types of Cutover**: Clones=
, build-backs, and =E2=80=9Cmove as is=E2=80=9D migrations.

### 2. UAT (User Acceptance Testing) Readiness and Governance =20
- **Purpose**: UAT is where end users validate the business functionality =
of new or changed systems before full cutover.
- **Timing**: UAT is =
occurring in tandem with cutover efforts.
- **Scope**: =20
  - IT is tasked with supporting UAT, developing a framework, and sharing =
past approaches.
  - Need to present to Sukai on Friday (exact date not set=
 but slides needed by end of the current week).
- **Deck Requirements**:
  - Develop 9=E2=80=9310 slides detailing:
    - The process for running =
UAT
    - Governance structure
    - Defect management and escalation =
processes
    - Reporting cadence and tools (e.g., JIRA)
    - PMO structure and escalation paths

#### UAT Process: =20
- **Kickoff**: UAT planning has started, focusing on end-to-end business =
processes. Some processes, people, or systems are changing, some remain the=
 same.
- **Change Mapping**: A matrix is being formed:
    - What=E2=80=99s changing: process, people, or systems?
    - Level of testing required (full UAT, regression/smoke test, or =
minimal test).
    - Out of ~300 applications, only 20+ are significantly =
changing for 8.1; these changes intersect with several business processes.

- **Testing Scope Selection** (=E2=80=98Down Selection=E2=80=99): =20
    - Out of all business processes, only those impacted by change need =
full testing.
    - Unchanged processes/systems get minimal/regression =
testing.
    - Aim is to focus testing resources efficiently on what truly =
needs validation.

- **Test Coordination**: =20
    - Structure to include =
functional UAT coordinators (IT, supply chain, HR, etc.) and test leads for=
 both IT systems and business areas.
    - Entry/exit criteria needed for =
each process or system change.
    - Need to track UAT readiness at each =
step.

- **Defect and Escalation Management**: =20
    - Clear roles and =
escalation paths when issues are discovered in UAT.
    - Mechanisms for retesting, reporting, and resolution (potentially =
using tools like JIRA).

- **Reporting & Dashboards**: =20
    - Need for reporting on UAT progress, readiness tracking, and =
dashboarding.=20
    - Expectation is to leverage existing tools (e.g., =
JIRA) for automated reports for stakeholders and steering committees.

### 3. Knowledge and Tools Sourcing
- **Reuse of Past Materials**:=20
  - The team is looking to repurpose content from previous projects (such =
as 3M, GE, or Residio) to accelerate deck creation.
  - Queries about where to find UAT materials within EY (EY=E2=80=99s =
internal resources).

- **Tool Discussion**:=20
  - JIRA and other systems =
may be used for logging test cases, tracking defects, and generating =
reports.

### 4. Miscellaneous / Other Action Items

- **Immediate Next Steps**:
    - Develop UAT governance/framework slides =
by Friday for Sukai.
    - Pull and adapt past UAT/testing materials from =
earlier projects and internal resources.
    - Reach out to colleagues (e.g=
., Skip, Harry) for additional examples or documentation if needed.
 =20
- **Project Dependencies and Decisions**:
    - A decision on Microsoft =
renewal is due in the next two to three days.
    - Meeting with Peterson =
will clarify the decision-making process for that renewal and provide =
additional clarity for the deck to be presented.

## Action Items / =
Follow-ups

- Team members to document and begin structuring the UAT =
framework deck immediately (June 12=E2=80=9314 assumed timeframe).
- Gather and review existing UAT materials within EY and from peer =
organizations (3M, GE, Residio).
- Set up or confirm the meeting with Sukai=
 for feedback on the proposed UAT framework.
- Clarify application/system =
changes and feed them into the test scope "down selection".
- Evaluate and confirm the tools (JIRA, others) for UAT execution, =
reporting, and dashboarding.
- Coordinate with PMO and function leads (like=
 Peers) for overall alignment and reporting.
- Monitor the Microsoft =
renewal timeline and ensure required input for the decision is obtained.

---

**Key Dates Mentioned**: =20
- Applications moving as-is: June-July =
2024 =20
- Cutover completions required before: October 2024 (preferably =
before Nov 1, 2024) =20
- Slides for Sukai due: by Friday (week of June 12,=
 2024)
- Microsoft renewal decision: within next 2-3 days from the meeting =
=20
- Ongoing: Outreach for past materials, UAT planning, and readiness =
tracking

**Key Figures Involved**: =20
- Sukai, Jeff (stakeholders)
- Peers (main IT PMO, UAT coordinator)
- Skip, Harry, Asha, Garrett =
(contacts for prior material)
- Srijiv, Bill (ERP/test script contacts)

---

This discussion provides a comprehensive overview of planning, =
governance, coordination, and immediate actions required to drive =
successful UAT and application cutover in a complex legal entity transition=
, with clear timelines, deliverables, decision points, and internal =
dependencies.

How do I cut over sales order, how do I cut=
 over purchase orders? That's all function related, supply chain related. =
IT will help out where we can with putting a view into how the cutover will=
 happen but where IT impacts is on systems. So ERP and ecosystem will get =
impacted by by legal entity changes. Right. So the rest of it and we'll get=
 into a bit more of that. Let's start at the high level operational =
separation from an application perspective. You're going to have =
applications that are moving over continuously. So there'll be some =
applications that are getting built back and move as is in the June time =
frame and July time frame. So those are actually happening now. There'll be=
 some applications that are 8.1 related where they go live to support the =
legal entity readiness like prp. There'll be some applications that are =
getting cut over sometime in July, August, September before the October =
time frame. So, so those are regular cutovers, they're clones, they're =
build backs, they're move as is. So those have to go through our migration =
path and have to cut over. So there's work here in terms of driving and =
defining what cut over, what testing is going to look like, how it's going =
to work, etc. So our scope of UAT that we need to support, that we've been =
asked to support is around then you've got some other apps non IT that are =
happening in this time frame. And this time frame every app is expected to =
get cut over before 111 because that's otherwise it's on TSA at that point.

2:07
So.

2:11
Kato uat. So apps are getting developed, built =
functionality tested in sit, they're going into uat. You know all of that =
SDLC work is happening in this time frame. What we need to do from an IT =
perspective is peers is a main IT PMO person but we need to work with peers=
 to understand and help him and put together, help him Honeywell put =
together a view of how we run uat. So what does a UAT process look like? =
What is the governance and structure on uat? How do defects get resolved? =
He's hung up. He and Jeff are hung up on defects management and escalation.=
 The defects are just one part of an overall part of how to run uat. So =
what we need to present to Sukai on Friday is a point of view on how we've =
run UAT before. So over the next, literally tomorrow and Thursday, today, =
tomorrow, Thursday we need to develop a deck that has a view on how do we =
run uat, how do we set it up, how do we govern it, how do we establish the =
cadence of reporting on things, how do we set up? Trackers and dashboarding=
 need not be the actual things but a view on because they would want to =
double click and triple click on the overall. So we need to give a view on =
how is UAT governance set up, how is that cutover happening, how do we tie =
into the rest of cutover and how do we run uat. So that's the essence of =
what we need to do for Deck for Friday for Sukai. So I'm having a =
conversation in the meantime, we need to have also trackers of how we're =
tracking to UAT readiness. So again, if you guys are taking notes, you want=
 may want to, you know, start documenting this because we'll start =
developing those over the next.

4:17
I am, yeah.

4:19
Right. So the idea here is Sukhai and Jeff want to view on. Okay. We see it=
 simply from an IT perspective. How do you guys run uat? Because UAT is =
where the end user testing happens. So until now IT has built its systems, =
they do sit, it's all IT led. But at this point you're going to have to ask=
 business users to come test the systems. So what happens if a user tests =
and things don't work? So they're more concerned, right or wrong about, =
well, how do you coordinate and be the connected. How does that connective =
tissue work of. I got UAT coordinators across the functions, so I've got a.=
 I've got an IT UAT coordinator, so across functions I've got UAT =
coordinators, so I'll have IT supply chain hr. I'm going to have test leads=
 that's across both IT systems as well as functions.

5:22
Do they already know what they need.

5:23
To test or is that okay, so =
that's all part of the evolving discovery right now. Okay, so we're going =
through a process where we kicked off UAT planning and we've said for this =
engagement we've got a set of processes, business processes, end to end =
processes that are in play. There are aspects of those processes that are =
changing. So let's say order to cash, procure to pay is an end to end =
process. Not everything there is changing because some processes are moving=
 as is, some people are moving as is. But they may end up using new systems=
. So if they end up using a new. So you can think of it as a matrix of, you=
 know, process changing, people changing and systems changing. And it's =
almost like, you know, test or no test or minimal test. So if the process =
is not changing, let's say it's a dedicated process and it's moving as is, =
or the process has not. There's not really any change to the process, then =
there's probably very little to test. It may have new people taking on the =
role to do the process tomorrow, in which case I might have to hire the =
people and do knowledge transfer, so I'll need to track that. It may also =
have systems that are live without or it's a new system that's being put in=
 place, in which case I have to do a full technical UAT on that system. I =
may not have a functional UAT on the process, but I'm going to have =
business users test the system for the scenarios. So we've had this initial=
 discussion about, okay, we think these are the universal processes. We're =
looking at understanding what is a down selection of those systems in play =
and within that context what is truly changing and what needs to test.

7:22
Down selection of systems in play, meaning.

7:24
Sound selection of processes and systems. Okay, so we have a view of the =
systems. It's really more processes. We have a view of the systems that are=
 touching every process. We have a view of the systems that are changing =
for 8.1 and systems changing for 11.1. If we're to just focus on 8.1 for =
now, there's only a subset of systems that are truly changing. Out of 300 =
apps in the landscape, I think there's 20 something of them that are =
changing. But however, from a process perspective, they may be touching =
seven or eight systems. We may only have four or five systems changing. So =
what we're trying to understand is okay, I've got these processes, the =
process owners, they're touching, let's say I have to do just going to pick=
 up something. Logistics management and supply chain. For logistics =
management, they're going to have to do a view of supply planning. They may=
 touch erp. For transportation management, they may be touching another =
system. That process may not change. They may have new vendors, for example=
. But the point is if they have new vendors, they'll have to get the =
contracts from vendors, etc. But the process itself may not change. Yeah, =
the system may or may not change. What we're trying to find out is one, the=
 system may not change, but two, there may be a system in play that is =
still being used and we need to understand what needs to be tested there. =
We're starting work with each function between it and the functions to =
define. And this is the second part of the tracker. We'll need to develop, =
but to have a view of what is truly changing in a process or what's truly =
changing in a system so that we can mark off what needs to be tested.

9:14
Yeah.

9:15
I mean, is that how you get.

9:17
To all of the like unique =
scenarios that you were talking about that are ultimately tested?

9:23
Yes. So you have to down select the scenarios.

9:26
Yeah.

9:27
And the way you do that is.

9:28
I don't know what you mean by down select=
.

9:30
Down select, meaning I got a thousand processes in play. If 900 of =
them are not changing, I only need to test the other 100.

9:38
Okay, yeah, sure.

9:39
Yes. So I have to down select and understand what =
is in scope for my testing.

9:43
Okay.

9:44
And the down selection also =
is there are certain things where I might need to do cursory testing and =
not a full blown UAT as a process. So if the process is not changing, but =
I'm touching something else, I may just go in and do some regression =
testing or smoke testing on that process. Actually from that's more of a =
system perspective, but from a process perspective, I may just do some =
basic. Yeah, smoke test.

10:11
Maybe the legal entity changed. The system =
is staying the same. You need to.

10:15
Or I see the name there. Right. So=
 my legal entity has changed the process. If I go through the process of =
six steps there. Yeah, I see the new legal entity show up.

10:23
Yeah.

10:24
Okay, I'm done. I don't need to test anything per se. Right. So =
there's very cursed minimal testing there. The second piece of this is full=
 blown testing of a process because the process has truly changed. So the =
down selection happens when I've got out of the thousand processes, I'm =
selecting what is truly changing and to select that I need to go back and =
look at what is changing and sync up between systems and processes.

10:52
Yeah.

10:53
So that in a nutshell is the scope of testing. But what we =
need to do is define a framework for these guys and help define a framework=
 of here's what I need to test. Here's how we're going to track that you're=
 ready for this testing. Because the testing timelines are the testing =
timelines that will come up when the systems are ready to test. The =
question is, how do we plan that? How do we define a governance model? How =
do we plan, how do we suggest the execution of this and managing of this. =
We may not be physically doing it, but we need to give them a framework and=
 an approach that we've used in the past to say here's how you run uat, =
here's how as coordinators you work with other coordinators to do this. =
Here's how you set up the governance, here's how defects and issues are =
resolved. If, let's say I have a test lead that's testing that scenario and=
 it fails, how does that get escalated to be retested? How does that, you =
know, who escalates? So they want to know a bit more on how that all =
stitches together. Yeah, so it shouldn't be too different than what we've =
done in the past. We should have content for it. We need to what? At least =
for the first pass, I'm looking to repurpose some of the content and say, =
here's how we think you should run uat. Here's how it should do work, =
here's how other functions and PMO should do the work, sort of roles and =
responsibilities. And this is what we want to look, to give to you, to say,=
 this is how we're thinking through things. They can poke holes at it, they=
 can break it out and tell us, no, we want more details here, we want to =
triple click, etc. Then we can get into, okay, let's out a full blown UAT =
testing thing that will sync up with the cutover testing team, that will =
sync up with other teams, etc. Etc. But let's start with, you know, a view =
on here's how you should run uat.

12:52
Do they have a tool like JIRA or =
something?

12:55
So we should also give them tools on logistics as well. =
So, you know, so the point would be, you know, there are things around, =
okay, I have some maybe testing Windows. I first maybe may be doing it =
virtually or physically in a location. I may be giving people laptops to =
come test this because it may be on an Athens laptop instead of a Honeywell=
 laptop. Or I may have test laptops and test periods where people come in =
at a particular function, come in and do the testing and report out on it. =
There are things like entry and exit criteria. So there's all the =
governance around. Here's how I would define an entry and exit criteria for=
 this testing scope. I need, I need to pass these things or I need to sign =
off on these. So there's a lot, all the logistics around. How do you run =
the test, how do you pass the test? How do you sign off on the test? What =
tools do you use? Example jira. How do you document that? Because prior to =
all of that, part of this is understanding what the scenarios are and then =
saying, okay, I've got a thousand tests, I've got thousand processes =
changing or 1000 processes in scope. I only have 147 of them changing. And =
for those 147, I need to test the scenarios. Maybe there are three =
scenarios per process or something to the effect I come up with 500 test =
scenarios. I now need to then go back and say for these 500 scenarios, what=
 test scripts do you guys already have? The point you're talking about with=
 Srijiv and Bill are defining for 5 ERP, what test scripts do they already =
have? If they don't have it, they have to go create these to support these =
processes or even systems. If they do have it but it doesn't fit, then =
they'll have to go adjust these test scripts so that it fits what the =
process of the scenario being tested. So that's what we want to help them =
get to and say, here's a scope, here's how you want to run it, here's how =
you want to find these out, here's how you have to execute on it and give =
them a framework. So it's a bit, you know, so it's, it's really top down, =
double click into it and perhaps one level down the minutiae of it. We can =
work on it after we talk to Sukai Friday. But Pierce needs this view to be =
able to because he's also lost. Yeah, he needs, as UAT it, UAT coordinator,=
 he needs these things and more importantly, he will need reporting as to =
what is the readiness of it. How do you run reports, how do you show? Maybe=
 a lot of this is in JIRA already and you get automated reports from JIRA =
that comes up. But we just need to provide an approach to say, okay, if =
Jeff wants us steerco update and he says, well, what is your testing =
progress? We should be able to provide some dashboard to say across these =
functions and these scenarios.

15:52
Yes. Before we move on real quick. So=
 I know the Microsoft renewal is.

15:56
Coming up very soon.

15:58
Is that a decision that we need.

15:59
To come to within the next two or =
three days? But at least first I want to get a view of what is this? What =
is this? All right, so talking to Peterson. Okay, thank you. Just is it =
three?

16:11
But isn't that mean that you were mentioned? Yes, yes, three,=
 two.

16:15
Okay, so we'll talk to him, understand that and make sure that=
 we understand what we're providing for Friday. That meeting with Suka =
hasn't been set up yet. Okay. But the idea would be we quickly pivot and =
get a framework and approach in a few slides, say nine to 10 slides on. =
Here's how the UAT should be run Here are the double clicks that you want =
into it. All these, you know, six topics. Let's double click on each topic.

16:41
Yeah.

16:41
And here's how we think the structure. PMO structure =
should be an escalation.

16:47
Should be.

16:48
Yeah. So if he's getting =
any other and reporting more importantly reporting from.

16:53
You know how they did Essex by chance.

16:56
Essex is not.

16:57
It was an ugly then maybe residio or hi or do you have anything from your =
past projects we should have within Ey. Yeah.

17:07
I just asked the deal tech librarian and it's not very helpful.

17:10
Yeah.

17:11
Librarian for what?

17:12
For UAT materials.

17:14
Yeah, I even look through some of the.

17:16
So what about 3M you guys. =
Who is working on 3M?

17:20
I can get that from Skip.

17:22
Skip be a good example. I think.

17:27
Garrett Sean gave me something.

17:29
From 3M or GE because they went through it. Did we?

17:40
Yeah.

17:41
You know Asha Garrett or Harry by chance.

17:47
No, I don't know either from now.

17:48
All right. I can reach out to them=
. I think they were reach out to hurry.

17:51
Yeah. You may have something=
 on uat.

17:53
Yeah, I think he did cut over stuff.

17:56
This is a bit more than cut.

17:57
Okay, here's a cutover plan.

18:00
I wouldn't say cut over plan as much. I would assume part of the cutover =
was uat.

18:17
It.

that SDLC work is happening in this time frame. What we need to do from an =
IT perspective is peers is a main IT PMO person but we need to work with =
peers to understand and help him and put together, help him Honeywell put =

What is the governance and structure on uat? How do defects get resolved? =
He&#x27;s hung up. He and Jeff are hung up on defects management and =
escalation. The defects are just one part of an overall part of how to run =
uat. So what we need to present to Sukai on Friday is a point of view on =
how we&#x27;ve run UAT before. So over the next, literally tomorrow and =
Thursday, today, tomorrow, Thursday we need to develop a deck that has a =
view on how do we run uat, how do we set it up, how do we govern it, how do=
 we establish the cadence of reporting on things, how do we set up? =

 we need to give a view on how is UAT governance set up, how is that =

 uat. So that&#x27;s the essence of what we need to do for Deck for Friday =
for Sukai. So I&#x27;m having a conversation in the meantime, we need to =

 that okay, so that&#x27;s all part of the evolving discovery right now. =
Okay, so we&#x27;re going through a process where we kicked off UAT =
planning and we&#x27;ve said for this engagement we&#x27;ve got a set of =
processes, business processes, end to end processes that are in play. There=
 are aspects of those processes that are changing. So let&#x27;s say order =
to cash, procure to pay is an end to end process. Not everything there is =
changing because some processes are moving as is, some people are moving as=
 is. But they may end up using new systems. So if they end up using a new. =
So you can think of it as a matrix of, you know, process changing, people =
changing and systems changing. And it&#x27;s almost like, you know, test or=
 no test or minimal test. So if the process is not changing, let&#x27;s say=
 it&#x27;s a dedicated process and it&#x27;s moving as is, or the process =
has not. There&#x27;s not really any change to the process, then =
there&#x27;s probably very little to test. It may have new people taking on=
 the role to do the process tomorrow, in which case I might have to hire =
the people and do knowledge transfer, so I&#x27;ll need to track that. It =
may also have systems that are live without or it&#x27;s a new system =
that&#x27;s being put in place, in which case I have to do a full technical=
 UAT on that system. I may not have a functional UAT on the process, but =
I&#x27;m going to have business users test the system for the scenarios. So=
 we&#x27;ve had this initial discussion about, okay, we think these are the=
 universal processes. We&#x27;re looking at understanding what is a down =
selection of those systems in play and within that context what is truly =
changing and what needs to test.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16p=

 a view of the systems. It&#x27;s really more processes. We have a view of =
the systems that are touching every process. We have a view of the systems =
that are changing for 8.1 and systems changing for 11.1. If we&#x27;re to =
just focus on 8.1 for now, there&#x27;s only a subset of systems that are =
truly changing. Out of 300 apps in the landscape, I think there&#x27;s 20 =
something of them that are changing. But however, from a process =
perspective, they may be touching seven or eight systems. We may only have =
four or five systems changing. So what we&#x27;re trying to understand is =
okay, I&#x27;ve got these processes, the process owners, they&#x27;re =
touching, let&#x27;s say I have to do just going to pick up something. =
Logistics management and supply chain. For logistics management, =
they&#x27;re going to have to do a view of supply planning. They may touch =
erp. For transportation management, they may be touching another system. =
That process may not change. They may have new vendors, for example. But =
the point is if they have new vendors, they&#x27;ll have to get the =
contracts from vendors, etc. But the process itself may not change. Yeah, =
the system may or may not change. What we&#x27;re trying to find out is one=
, the system may not change, but two, there may be a system in play that is=
 still being used and we need to understand what needs to be tested there. =
We&#x27;re starting work with each function between it and the functions to=
 define. And this is the second part of the tracker. We&#x27;ll need to =
develop, but to have a view of what is truly changing in a process or =
what&#x27;s truly changing in a system so that we can mark off what needs =
to be tested.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;back=

also give them tools on logistics as well. So, you know, so the point would=

Windows. I first maybe may be doing it virtually or physically in a =
location. I may be giving people laptops to come test this because it may =
be on an Athens laptop instead of a Honeywell laptop. Or I may have test =
laptops and test periods where people come in at a particular function, =

entry and exit criteria. So there&#x27;s all the governance around. =
Here&#x27;s how I would define an entry and exit criteria for this testing =

So there&#x27;s a lot, all the logistics around. How do you run the test, =
how do you pass the test? How do you sign off on the test? What tools do =
you use? Example jira. How do you document that? Because prior to all of =
that, part of this is understanding what the scenarios are and then saying,=
 okay, I&#x27;ve got a thousand tests, I&#x27;ve got thousand processes =
changing or 1000 processes in scope. I only have 147 of them changing. And =
for those 147, I need to test the scenarios. Maybe there are three =
scenarios per process or something to the effect I come up with 500 test =
scenarios. I now need to then go back and say for these 500 scenarios, what=
 test scripts do you guys already have? The point you&#x27;re talking about=
 with Srijiv and Bill are defining for 5 ERP, what test scripts do they =
already have? If they don&#x27;t have it, they have to go create these to =
support these processes or even systems. If they do have it but it =
doesn&#x27;t fit, then they&#x27;ll have to go adjust these test scripts so=
 that it fits what the process of the scenario being tested. So that&#x27;s=
 what we want to help them get to and say, here&#x27;s a scope, here&#x27;s=
 how you want to run it, here&#x27;s how you want to find these out, =
here&#x27;s how you have to execute on it and give them a framework. So =
it&#x27;s a bit, you know, so it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s really top down, double =
click into it and perhaps one level down the minutiae of it. We can work on=
 it after we talk to Sukai Friday. But Pierce needs this view to be able to=
 because he&#x27;s also lost. Yeah, he needs, as UAT it, UAT coordinator, =
he needs these things and more importantly, he will need reporting as to =
what is the readiness of it. How do you run reports, how do you show? Maybe=
 a lot of this is in JIRA already and you get automated reports from JIRA =
that comes up. But we just need to provide an approach to say, okay, if =
Jeff wants us steerco update and he says, well, what is your testing =
progress? We should be able to provide some dashboard to say across these =
