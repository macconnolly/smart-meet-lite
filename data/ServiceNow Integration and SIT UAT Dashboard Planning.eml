Meeting Summary

*Date:* June 13, 2025
------------------------------
Attendees

   - Paul
   - Avinash
   - Catherine (clarified not the ServiceNow lead)
   - Jim Litwin (probable ServiceNow lead)
   - Jeff (reference to earlier conversation)
   - Mac
   - Justin
   - Bill Ponsetti
   - Other Project/Workstream/IT Leads (mentioned in dialogue)

------------------------------
Main Topics Discussed1. *ServiceNow Leadership and Integration*

   - Uncertainty about the ServiceNow lead: Initially Catherine was
   mentioned, but consensus was that Jim Litwin is likely the lead.
   - Need to consult Jim regarding the use and integration of the Solstice
   instance and Honeywell support in ServiceNow.
   - Recognition of two separate ServiceNow environments (potential
   Honeywell=E2=80=93Solstice split) and implications for support/ticketing=
.
   - Action pending: Meet with Jim Litwin for clarity on ServiceNow
   responsibilities and integration with broader service desk functions.

2. *Hypercare Planning and Governance*

   - Recap of earlier call with Jeff, emphasizing the need for robust
   Hypercare during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and cutover periods.
   - Recognition that Hypercare will require coordinated input across IT,
   HR, and legal entities.
   - Discussion on structuring the PMO (Project Management Office) and
   governance around Hypercare.
   - The need to establish common tools and platforms (ServiceNow
   prominent) for issue reporting and governance.
   - Emphasis on properly prioritizing, classifying, and triaging issues
   throughout Hypercare.

3. *Ticket Intake and Defect Management*

   - Service Desk established as a primary intake channel for support
   tickets, with a linkage needed to ServiceNow and possibly other channels=
.
   - Clarified need for concrete processes to link disparate tools and
   reporting streams.
   - Call to develop integration procedures for ticket management,
   especially as Athens and Honeywell instances go live.

4. *SIT/UAT Status Tracking and Dashboard Reporting*

   - Current state: Work plans exist showing SIT (System Integration
   Testing) status by application, but defect tracking is incomplete.
   - Ongoing effort:
      - Collect defects data from the ERP team; a call is scheduled for
      this.
      - Mockup of dashboards prepared using PowerPoint slides to visualize
      both SIT and UAT statuses for the executive summary requested by Jeff=
.
         - Dashboard to show:
            - Total number of systems/apps in SIT/UAT
            - Status (planned, in-progress, at risk, completed)
            - Defects count by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
         - Desire to automate reporting, with the longer-term goal of Power
      BI dashboards integrated with Smartsheet data.
      - Further aspiration to eventually host all reporting in Capital Edge
      for seamless weekly reporting.
   - Key reporting needs:
      - Status of all systems/apps by SIT and UAT phase
      - 30-day UAT lookahead, visualized in a horizontal bar chart by
      workstream (finance, supply chain, HR, etc.)
      - Dynamic drill-downs to see details by application or workstream
      - Defect analysis (number, severity, closure rates)
   - Data sources and ownership:
      - Smartsheet currently houses work plan data, with override
      capabilities for updated actuals.
      - Defect data believed to reside in JIRA, with Bill Ponsetti as
      possible owner.
      - RAID log: exists for program risks, but not specific to SIT/UAT
      risks unless those affect overall go-live; functional risk
documentation is
      inconsistent.

5. *Functional Test Scenarios & Process Linkage*

   - Acknowledgement that while system-level status is being tracked,
   linkage to functional test scenarios is incomplete.
   - Each function (finance, supply chain, etc.) maintains its own process
   trackers listing test scenarios, generally outside Capital Edge, but not
   fully linked to the system inventory dashboard.
   - Noted value in mapping process test scenarios (end-to-end scenarios
   like procure-to-pay) to system status in future reporting.
   - Challenge remains in consolidating systems-level and process-level
   testing information into a single reporting structure.

6. *Key Personnel and Data Gaps*

   - Queries for data ownership, notably who in Enterprise IT can provide
   live dashboard/reporting info: Aaron Hicks named as primary resource for
   dashboards, Bill Ponsetti for ERP defects and test scenarios.
   - Acknowledgement of incomplete data: not all work plans have start/end
   dates for SIT and UAT; continuing effort to fill gaps through alignment
   calls.

7. *Process for Tomorrow=E2=80=99s (June 14, 2025) Executive Conversation*

   - Plan to present dashboard mockups in PowerPoint and collect feedback.
   - Will use latest data from Smartsheets, with overlays for any
   adjustments from direct team feedback.
   - Emphasis on readiness to accept criticism and iterate
   post-presentation.
   - Push to obtain defect counts and scenario test lists remains ongoing.

------------------------------
Action Items

   1. *Meet with Jim Litwin*
      - Clarify ServiceNow leadership, use of Solstice instance, and
      Honeywell support integration.
   2. *Pull Data from ERP Team (Bill Ponsetti, SRI/Shrijib/Srinivas)*
      - Collect SIT/UAT defects data; particularly severity and closure.
   3. *Connect with Enterprise IT (Aaron Hicks)*
      - Assess available dashboarding capabilities for SIT/UAT/incidents;
      learn from existing assets.
   4. *Prepare and Present Dashboard Slides for June 14 Executive Meeting*
      - Mock up execution dashboard showing:
         - Total systems/apps in SIT/UAT
         - Current status distribution with color-coding
         - 30-day lookahead for UAT by workstream
      - Overlay with latest available data; be ready to update per
      executive feedback.
   5. *Continue Functional Alignment Calls*
      - Ensure updated and accurate SIT/UAT dates per app/system.
      - Collect process test scenario counts for future integration.
   6. *Explore Capital Edge Reporting Integration*
      - Investigate how system and process tracker data (test scenario
      completion, app status) can be consolidated within Capital Edge.
   7. *Obtain/Update RAID Logs*
      - Confirm risk entries are comprehensive enough to signal issues at
      the SIT/UAT level, not just overall program risks.
   8. *Defect Reporting*
      - Confirm or establish reporting capability (likely from JIRA) for
      SIT/UAT defect counts and trends for executive visibility.

------------------------------
Follow-Up Points & Meetings

   - *Tomorrow (June 14, 2025):* Executive meeting with Jeff to present and
   review dashboard mockups and receive direction.
   - *Alignment Calls:* Ongoing with workstream and project teams to
   validate SIT/UAT statuses and capture accurate test dates.
   - *With Bill Ponsetti (4 PM, date unspecified):* Meeting scheduled to
   pull defect reports and gain further clarity on open items and data sour=
ces.
   - *Post-executive meeting:* Revise and improve dashboards based on
   Jeff=E2=80=99s feedback; continue efforts to automate and consolidate re=
porting.
   - *Future Integration:* Continue plans to move all reporting to Capital
   Edge and tie in process and system test data for a unified view.

=F0=9F=8E=99=EF=B8=8FTranscription
Paul0:00
Okay, so who's our ServiceNow lead?
Justin0:05
It's not Catherine. Or is it Jim Litman?
Paul0:09
It's probably Jim Litwin. So we need to hear from Jim on ServiceNow.
Justin0:15
Okay.
Paul0:16
Whether we can use the Solstice instance, and then just for anything that
we need Honeywell support, it floats back to that there servicenow.
Justin0:26
Okay, so that's a separate two. Okay, so we'll talk to Jim and see how that
will plan it. So, Avinash, and for the rest of you, the context of this is
we had a call with Jeff an hour ago or so where he talked about hypercare
and how we will run Hypercare for the UAT or the cutovers and in and
around. So as you can imagine, there are multiple threads into hypercare
and the command center. There's an IT portion around all of the it, there's
HR and people portion coming in, and then there's all this legal entity
portion that will come in as well. So the conversation was, well, how do
you set up the PMO structure or the structure for it, the governance around
it? What tools do we use? How do we report on IT on a common platform? And
there were things around. How do you prioritize the issues that come in?
How do you classify them? How do you triage them? And so the points Paul's
mentioning is we've got service now for Honeywell and Athens, some of which
is going live. We've got the service desk that is going to take in these
tickets as one of the channels. So we've got to link the two along with,
you know, other channels and lay out how it will work for it. So, yeah, so
action items there, Paul will take, certainly take, I think tactically
speaking, I wanted to make sure I, you know, for tomorrow. So, Avinash, I
don't know if you have the. And again, if you're not part of uat, probably
you never have the invite, but. And that's something maybe, you know, we
need to have a call when Pierce comes back on the support again.
Paul2:09
Were you involved with UIT at all or just.
Avinash2:12
No, no, we had one or two conversations. Outside of that, I have not really
been in the mix of it. My only suggestion as an. Again, I don't know what
the open items are to help support you folks out here. The only question
that I would have is, do we have that entire schedule from across all the
functions that you would want to present it for tomorrow's conversation?
Justin2:48
Yes. So we have a view from other functions as well as from all the apps.
So, yeah, so For SIT status. So we have work plans that show SIT status by
app. What we don't have yet is the defects that are ongoing. Right now. I
think we have a call set up with the ERP team to understand defects across
erp. We have a view. Well, starting to develop a view on the 30 day. Look
ahead and let me and Mac, if you want to pull up your sheet, the PowerPoint
slide, why don't we show that up as a mock up to Paul and then we can talk
through how we want to show for tomorrow's conversation with. It will be
populated with actual data Paul. But Mac, if you want to pull up that same
slide. Couple of slides. Yep, yep. So what we're thinking, Paul, is maybe
we call this just execution Dashboard. It's not UAT execution, but a mock
up like this that has, you know, you've got. The total number of this is
purely from a system perspective and not from a process uat, but you've
got, from a systems perspective. You've got this view of. Because you were
saying systems in sit, you've got this dashboard view of SIT and uat and
you've got a dynamic view of the planned sits in progress. Actually we
should say planned testing in progress because it's a stacked graph with.
No, no, no, no. Just instead of planned sit, I said planned testing. So
because you have a stack of SIT and a uat and obviously there'll be more
reds to the left and more blacks to the right, but as time progresses that
will also change. But wanted to get your initial reaction on a view like
this for him tomorrow.
Paul4:59
I think this is directionally what he wants when I'm interact. But we need
to tell him, you know, we need to tie out with Enterprise IT because they
might already have these dashboards live.
Justin5:13
Okay, let me. And so who from Enterprise it Avinash, would you know who
from Enterprise IT we could talk to? First things like these.
Paul5:26
Incidents. Aaron Hicks is like the king of dashboards and PowerPoint.
Justin5:32
Well, so in. No, no, no. Yeah, yeah. That's down the lane for tomorrow
because their people are very much in sit. And Bill and that ERP team have
potentially SIT defects and the number of defects they're fixing. We need
to talk to Bill Ponsetti and SRI or Shrijib or Srinivas, one of those guys
to get some data.
Paul5:54
You need to go to the project managers.
Justin5:56
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so Bill, okay, so Bill Ponsetti may have that data. We'll
have to talk to him. But from a directional perspective if he wants. If If
I'm trying to address. Answer the question for Jeff on, you know, do I have
this as SIT status overall and by application this should give me a view.
So if I were to click on the number one, you know, it's dynamic, it will
take me to that. Or if I were to click on 21, it should take me to the list
of 21 apps that are planned, sit or on track and that could be by
workstream. I could have 15 ERP and 7 supply chain, but it'll at least give
me that view or it'll take me to the work streams. But I think what we're
trying to do at least for tomorrow is show him progress on where sit is and
use the actual data we have in the work plans and then show him a view like
this. And then the other second piece he asked for was a 30 day look ahead
on UAT. So that's well, mocking up something on slide two. And if you go to
slide two, that essentially will be, instead of a stacked, it'll be a bar
graph, a horizontal bar graph that essentially has, you know, the by work
stream. It'll have, you know, it'll have, you know, so many for finance,
you know, so many for supply chain, et cetera. But this is a 30 day look
ahead of. We take it from the same data we have in the work plan and we
say, okay, 82 apps in play. You know, there's one UAT at risk over the next
30 days. There's another 20, you know, 25 of them happening next 30 days
and 75 of them happening within the next 60 days in example. So again,
directionally, we want to, you know, talk through this. Yeah, Again, you
know, finance could be half the size of ISE or HR could be a third of the
size of ISE as an example. Right. So directionally, do we think these
couple of slides like these help?
Paul8:12
Yeah, I mean this is what he's asking for. So I'm going to say yes. And
frankly, we'll probably do it right in PowerPoint.
Justin8:23
Yeah. What we're trying to do, Paul, is try to automate this in terms of
reporting and dashboard that he wants. Ideally over the next couple of
weeks we build some power BI dashboards on top of the smartsheets that we
have.
Paul8:35
Right.
Justin8:36
Ideal, ideal scenario is we take the same work plans, move it into Capital
Edge and run a report out of Capital Edge similar to what, you know, pre,
similar to your work plan reporting every week in the opsep call. We're not
yet there yet, but at least for now we have all the smartsheet data. We can
run this on smartsheets and then see where we want to move it to. But you
know, at least it's a little more, you know build a, build a dashboard on
top of smartsheet will provide us some view like that.
Avinash9:13
Now FX consolidated view plan that you're talking about.
Justin9:18
Yeah. So if you. Yeah, yeah, Justin, if you go into, maybe I'll turn it
over you. Justin. So in smartsheets we have all the work plans that the
teams keep and we have a list of all the ass, you know, the apps there.
Paul9:40
Yeah, yeah. I just don't know if you go into any work plan right now and
you talk to the team, teams do they have, do they know him in a uat.
Justin9:50
So good question. We have a provision to override that. So these alignment
calls that we've been setting up with the teams are precisely to capture
that data, to say listen, I've got these. So many BRV and BRV adjacent
apps. I know there are some build back move as is apps and there's 80
something of them. What is, you know some of these apps from an app system
perspective we have 290 something apps, 100 of them live without, 100 of
them on TSA. So it's really the remaining that we're working with. So for
each one of those we've gone and asked the teams, some are missing but many
we have on what are the sit start and end dates and what are the UAT start
and end dates. Justin, keep me honest. Is that the case?
Paul10:46
Like very basic dates right now that's.
Avinash10:49
Coming from the work plans.
Paul10:51
But of course there is a review process that we're going through right now.
Justin10:55
So we're going to override. So Paul, the starting for this is the work
plans. We get the dates out of the work plans and you see that here we're
going to overwrite that with the information we have received as part of
these conversations. So for example this, you know they're claiming workiva
is a risk. Okay, we understand if it's truly those dates and why it's a
risk and we overwrite it. We'll add some columns here to overwrite it.
We'll run these reporting based on those overwritten dates or whatever. You
know, we'll make it formulaic but we'll be able to run a report or a BI on
top of this that provides us that dashboard view that says I've got 15 sits
at risk, 7 UATs at risk or 85 UAT is not started, et cetera.
Avinash11:40
But then what is that risk? Do you get an articulation from them or is that
captured somewhere else to say why is it at risk?
Justin11:48
Yeah, so that will have to come from them.
Avinash11:50
Yes. It's not the. You would know.
Justin11:53
No, no, no. But yeah, no.
Avinash11:55
Are they documenting you?
Justin11:56
Yes. Yeah, that's the other piece of it is the question becomes how many
data sources do we go get this information out of? They don't necessarily
are. They're not necessarily documenting it in the work plan other than say
it's at risk for completion because technically Speaking it's a 69 to 619
and it looks like it started but it's a risk for, you know, stop, risk for
end. So but this is a good question. No, no, no, that is their, their,
that's their tagging how they've tagged it. Because otherwise if it's not
even a start, it will show.
Avinash12:39
At risk.
Justin12:41
At risk to complete. If it's not started, it would show it as delayed.
Avinash12:46
Okay, but is there an overall tracker for managing the risks across all of
these initiatives?
Justin12:52
Yeah, we have an overall global RAID log, but it's not. This is not
necessarily an sit UAT rate log. Overall program RAID log we have as.
Avinash13:03
In the expectation that these project managers from the individual covers
are supposed to go out there and log these any kind of risk that they have
for.
Justin13:13
Anything and everything for program completion, not necessarily for minute,
not for anything and everything. So they're not likely to go touch it and
say I have an, you know, Bill Ponsetti is not going to go in there and say
workiva is late for sit completion. He'll say, is it workiva late for go
live? And right now, if it is, then it will be tagged. If it's, you know, I
had a late sit start, but I can make up and finish it then it doesn't ever
get identified there. But coming back to this. So Paul, we have the
worksheet and the work plan. We're going to overwrite it with our numbers
that we've received, the dates we received from them. And we want to run
these, the dashboard you saw coming off of these for all of these apps.
Avinash14:05
Well, you have the apps. Do you also know how many scenarios that each of
the functions would have to test?
Justin14:11
Let's say, for example, not in here, but yes, there are the. Again, Bill
has it. We're looking to get that information. So we don't have it yet.
That's the other piece, I think to.
Avinash14:25
Last week's conversation and sorry Sukhai or Jeff mentioned that tie out
with the functional needs, ensure that there is awareness of what they need
to test for that we have. So in that conversation it is going to be very
helpful to have how many scenarios or what is it that they're going to be
testing? Because when you ask generally to test anything to say test the
application, the first question is what am I testing? We'll have to say
start to finish. At the end of the day for example, when I say I forgot
since I know that through the process of starting from creating a
requisition or a sourcing event or whatever it is, then we acknowledge the
invoice in our system. An end to end, source to invoice or source to pay
attention. There are scenarios that they test and validate. So they would
list down. These are the number of scenarios that they would have to test.
Justin15:29
Yes. So functions are doing that in the process areas, not necessarily
across the system. There's a process tracker that tracks to your point end
to end, procure to pay. I'm running 150 scenarios across these sub
processes in procure to pay or Gokul or promote or even Sriram on the ISE
business side function side is going to have is has those scenarios. The
now that's outside of this situat ask for him. This is simply from a
systems perspective. How many systems are going live? When is my sat, UAT
status? How many defects am I having? There's a second layer you're
bringing in which is from a process perspective. How are these things
getting linked? Because that is not anywhere here and I don't know, we have
to see where to track that. It's likely somewhere else in Capital Edge
where they go in and there's a tracking space there to say okay, I'm
testing this process and sub process I'm using these systems. I have this
many scenarios and have I completed or this many test scripts. Have I
completed? Have I run all the scenarios? So that tracker is in Capital
Edge, it's being tracked elsewhere. This one is purely from an inventory
perspective. I have 100 systems. Have I done SIT? Have I done UAT? Are
there any SIT defects? Are there any UAT defects and how many have been
closed?
Avinash17:02
Sorry if I got you guys delayed. The moment I see some of these things I go
back to my project.
Justin17:08
Yeah, no, you're asking the right question. I think it's just, it's in a
different spot and I think the question is that long term, I say long term
in a week or Two, we want to get them both in the same spot and that we'll
move this inventory to Capital Edge and try to run the same out of the same
reporting structure this stuff as well. But we're not yet there. So again,
I want to make sure I'm addressing Jeff's questions for tomorrow of
executive Summary, which I presume he means the 82 systems in play. Sit.
How many do I have for the sit? How many do I have for defects across the
tiers? How many? Look at it for UAT and our teams in place, ready for
testing. He's essentially asking the whole tracker. I just don't know if
we're ready with all of that yet.
Paul18:04
Oh, we're definitely not. There's a big ask.
Justin18:11
Yeah. So at least from an SIT perspective, I want to be able to address it
and say, you know, to the dashboard we showed earlier, I've got 100
systems, 82 systems, and this is where SIT is my application. Because SIT
is all at an app level.
Paul18:31
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
Justin18:33
And then for defects, we're talking to Bill and we'll see how many SEP one,
set two, not SEP one, step two, but you know, high, medium, low, critical
or critical high, medium, low. Defects are there in SIT today and I don't
know if that's run out of jira. I presume it's in JIRA and he'll be able to
pull some reports out of JIRA for us. So. And that for UAT, look ahead from
a systems perspective. We've got 30 day look ahead on when the systems UAT
is, but we don't necessarily have a look ahead from an end to end process
perspective. So this is where I need again it's, you know, peers as a UAT
coordinator to help drive some of this stuff and start capturing or at
least helping with this. But I know he can't, you know, he's not here to
defend himself. But yeah.
Danish20:05
Okay, so you mean Blood street leads, not tower.
Justin20:08
Yeah, sorry if he said tower lead, I thought Danish and others. But yeah.
Danish20:34
Tomorrow if people are not available. But essentially this like, you know,
understand who the service owners for these, you know, pitches and catches
across the TV2 apps has KT happen. If something's on the TSA, it's the same
person moving. Okay. Maybe more. If it's a move ass is it's a C person.
Okay. KT is complete. But if it's a new person on a shared app, that's a
build app, maybe it's a new person and K hasn't had. So from an IT
perspective, we wanted to track all those things and put it in there. We
just don't have. We haven't had the opportunity to go sit with all the work
streams and, and do this first. Maybe that's the. As one thing's all IT
connect is clearly being asked that we need to do this. We need full, you
know, full information.
Paul21:28
Yeah, we'll introduce first.
Danish21:33
We have to show that's how I prepared. So that's a separate, Separate. Say
that again. The application. Oh, the app factory. Okay. Okay. And then the
third one is this Sit. UAT and defense. Because I think we need to
understand how to combine them all and maybe use the standard dashboarding
to report. So, but anyway, so in the next steps, we're running out of time.
Justin22:18
But.
Danish22:18
At least as next steps, we will put that dashboard on top of this chart or
this, this Excel for tomorrow's conversation at least we will produce that
and have him react to it. It's on slides. You know, move it on to slides
and then we'll see if he likes it. If not, we'll get beaten up and we'll go
back and correct it for next week. And then for the defects, when we keep
it bill at 4, we'll see if we can pull some reporting. I think on that as
well. Right. Okay. I'll keep you posted. Thank you all. It's, it's, it's,
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's.

iscussed</h2><h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75re=
m">1. <strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">ServiceNow Leadership and Integrat=
ion</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Uncertainty about the ServiceNow lead: Initially Catherine was mentione=
d, but consensus was that Jim Litwin is likely the lead.</li>
<li>Need to consult Jim regarding the use and integration of the Solstice i=
nstance and Honeywell support in ServiceNow.</li>
<li>Recognition of two separate ServiceNow environments (potential Honeywel=
l=E2=80=93Solstice split) and implications for support/ticketing.</li>
<li>Action pending: Meet with Jim Litwin for clarity on ServiceNow responsi=
bilities and integration with broader service desk functions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">2. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Hypercare Planning and Governance</strong></h3>=
<ul>
<li>Recap of earlier call with Jeff, emphasizing the need for robust Hyperc=
are during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and cutover periods.</li>
<li>Recognition that Hypercare will require coordinated input across IT, HR=
, and legal entities.</li>
<li>Discussion on structuring the PMO (Project Management Office) and gover=
nance around Hypercare.</li>
<li>The need to establish common tools and platforms (ServiceNow prominent)=
 for issue reporting and governance.</li>
<li>Emphasis on properly prioritizing, classifying, and triaging issues thr=
oughout Hypercare.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">3. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Ticket Intake and Defect Management</strong></h=
3><ul>
<li>Service Desk established as a primary intake channel for support ticket=
s, with a linkage needed to ServiceNow and possibly other channels.</li>
<li>Clarified need for concrete processes to link disparate tools and repor=
ting streams.</li>
<li>Call to develop integration procedures for ticket management, especiall=
y as Athens and Honeywell instances go live.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">4. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">SIT/UAT Status Tracking and Dashboard Reporting=
</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Current state: Work plans exist showing SIT (System Integration Testing=
) status by application, but defect tracking is incomplete.</li>
<li>Ongoing effort:<ul>
<li>Collect defects data from the ERP team; a call is scheduled for this.</=
li>
<li>Mockup of dashboards prepared using PowerPoint slides to visualize both=
 SIT and UAT statuses for the executive summary requested by Jeff.<ul>
<li>Dashboard to show: <ul>
<li>Total number of systems/apps in SIT/UAT</li>
<li>Status (planned, in-progress, at risk, completed)</li>
<li>Defects count by severity (critical, high, medium, low)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Desire to automate reporting, with the longer-term goal of Power BI das=
hboards integrated with Smartsheet data.</li>
<li>Further aspiration to eventually host all reporting in Capital Edge for=
 seamless weekly reporting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key reporting needs:<ul>
<li>Status of all systems/apps by SIT and UAT phase</li>
<li>30-day UAT lookahead, visualized in a horizontal bar chart by workstrea=
m (finance, supply chain, HR, etc.)</li>
<li>Dynamic drill-downs to see details by application or workstream</li>
<li>Defect analysis (number, severity, closure rates)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data sources and ownership:<ul>
<li>Smartsheet currently houses work plan data, with override capabilities =
for updated actuals.</li>
<li>Defect data believed to reside in JIRA, with Bill Ponsetti as possible =
owner.</li>
<li>RAID log: exists for program risks, but not specific to SIT/UAT risks u=
nless those affect overall go-live; functional risk documentation is incons=
istent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">5. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Functional Test Scenarios &amp; Process Linkage=
</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Acknowledgement that while system-level status is being tracked, linkag=
e to functional test scenarios is incomplete.</li>
<li>Each function (finance, supply chain, etc.) maintains its own process t=
rackers listing test scenarios, generally outside Capital Edge, but not ful=
ly linked to the system inventory dashboard.</li>
<li>Noted value in mapping process test scenarios (end-to-end scenarios lik=
e procure-to-pay) to system status in future reporting.</li>
<li>Challenge remains in consolidating systems-level and process-level test=
ing information into a single reporting structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">6. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Key Personnel and Data Gaps</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Queries for data ownership, notably who in Enterprise IT can provide li=
ve dashboard/reporting info: Aaron Hicks named as primary resource for dash=
boards, Bill Ponsetti for ERP defects and test scenarios.</li>
<li>Acknowledgement of incomplete data: not all work plans have start/end d=
ates for SIT and UAT; continuing effort to fill gaps through alignment call=
s.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">7. <strong=
 style=3D"font-weight:bold">Process for Tomorrow=E2=80=99s (June 14, 2025) =
Executive Conversation</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Plan to present dashboard mockups in PowerPoint and collect feedback.</=
li>
<li>Will use latest data from Smartsheets, with overlays for any adjustment=
s from direct team feedback.</li>
<li>Emphasis on readiness to accept criticism and iterate post-presentation=
.</li>
<li>Push to obtain defect counts and scenario test lists remains ongoing.</=

<div style=3D"color:#475569;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6">Okay, so that&#=
39;s a separate two. Okay, so we&#39;ll talk to Jim and see how that will p=
lan it. So, Avinash, and for the rest of you, the context of this is we had=
 a call with Jeff an hour ago or so where he talked about hypercare and how=
 we will run Hypercare for the UAT or the cutovers and in and around. So as=
 you can imagine, there are multiple threads into hypercare and the command=
 center. There&#39;s an IT portion around all of the it, there&#39;s HR and=
 people portion coming in, and then there&#39;s all this legal entity porti=
on that will come in as well. So the conversation was, well, how do you set=
 up the PMO structure or the structure for it, the governance around it? Wh=
at tools do we use? How do we report on IT on a common platform? And there =
were things around. How do you prioritize the issues that come in? How do y=
ou classify them? How do you triage them? And so the points Paul&#39;s ment=
ioning is we&#39;ve got service now for Honeywell and Athens, some of which=
 is going live. We&#39;ve got the service desk that is going to take in the=
se tickets as one of the channels. So we&#39;ve got to link the two along w=
ith, you know, other channels and lay out how it will work for it. So, yeah=
, so action items there, Paul will take, certainly take, I think tactically=
 speaking, I wanted to make sure I, you know, for tomorrow. So, Avinash, I =
don&#39;t know if you have the. And again, if you&#39;re not part of uat, p=
robably you never have the invite, but. And that&#39;s something maybe, you=
 know, we need to have a call when Pierce comes back on the support again.<=

 we have work plans that show SIT status by app. What we don&#39;t have yet=
 is the defects that are ongoing. Right now. I think we have a call set up =
with the ERP team to understand defects across erp. We have a view. Well, s=
tarting to develop a view on the 30 day. Look ahead and let me and Mac, if =
you want to pull up your sheet, the PowerPoint slide, why don&#39;t we show=
 that up as a mock up to Paul and then we can talk through how we want to s=
how for tomorrow&#39;s conversation with. It will be populated with actual =
data Paul. But Mac, if you want to pull up that same slide. Couple of slide=
s. Yep, yep. So what we&#39;re thinking, Paul, is maybe we call this just e=
xecution Dashboard. It&#39;s not UAT execution, but a mock up like this tha=
t has, you know, you&#39;ve got. The total number of this is purely from a =
system perspective and not from a process uat, but you&#39;ve got, from a s=
ystems perspective. You&#39;ve got this view of. Because you were saying sy=
stems in sit, you&#39;ve got this dashboard view of SIT and uat and you&#39=
;ve got a dynamic view of the planned sits in progress. Actually we should =
say planned testing in progress because it&#39;s a stacked graph with. No, =
no, no, no. Just instead of planned sit, I said planned testing. So because=
 you have a stack of SIT and a uat and obviously there&#39;ll be more reds =

also change. But wanted to get your initial reaction on a view like this fo=

r Jeff on, you know, do I have this as SIT status overall and by applicatio=
n this should give me a view. So if I were to click on the number one, you =
know, it&#39;s dynamic, it will take me to that. Or if I were to click on 2=
1, it should take me to the list of 21 apps that are planned, sit or on tra=

 but it&#39;ll at least give me that view or it&#39;ll take me to the work =
streams. But I think what we&#39;re trying to do at least for tomorrow is s=
how him progress on where sit is and use the actual data we have in the wor=
k plans and then show him a view like this. And then the other second piece=
 he asked for was a 30 day look ahead on UAT. So that&#39;s well, mocking u=
p something on slide two. And if you go to slide two, that essentially will=
 be, instead of a stacked, it&#39;ll be a bar graph, a horizontal bar graph=
 that essentially has, you know, the by work stream. It&#39;ll have, you kn=
ow, it&#39;ll have, you know, so many for finance, you know, so many for su=
pply chain, et cetera. But this is a 30 day look ahead of. We take it from =
the same data we have in the work plan and we say, okay, 82 apps in play. Y=
ou know, there&#39;s one UAT at risk over the next 30 days. There&#39;s ano=
ther 20, you know, 25 of them happening next 30 days and 75 of them happeni=
ng within the next 60 days in example. So again, directionally, we want to,=
 you know, talk through this. Yeah, Again, you know, finance could be half =
the size of ISE or HR could be a third of the size of ISE as an example. Ri=
ght. So directionally, do we think these couple of slides like these help?<=
