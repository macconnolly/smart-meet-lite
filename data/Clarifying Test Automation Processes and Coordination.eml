Clarifying Test Automation Processes and Coordination

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Test Script Validation and Execution =
Process

- **Clarification of Automation vs. Manual Processes**
  - Discussion centers on how to accurately categorize and track test =
scripts as automated, manual, or semi-automated.
  - Jeff is seeking =
assurance that there=E2=80=99s a clear, detailed plan for how scripts are =
tested, including exactly who is responsible and in what order tasks =
occur=E2=80=94even down to specific individuals running scripts.
  - Reference to two UAT (User Acceptance Testing) types: automated and =
non-automated (e.g., finance and ERP).
  - Suggestion to update the =
execution status dashboard by adding a column for =E2=80=98testing =
type=E2=80=99 and possibly providing an appendix with a detailed breakdown =
(automated vs. manual).

- **Insight Into Failures**
  - Automated test failures are attributed more to system defects, while =
manual test failures might be due to human error.
  - Jeff appears to want =
granular details, not just statistics, on which scripts in each set are =
automated vs. manual.

- **Clarification Needed From Bill**
  - Discussion about certain scripts or functions denoted as =
=E2=80=9Csemi-automated=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cfully manual=E2=80=9D, and =
combinations like =E2=80=9Cfully automated and manual=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94all =
of which require clarification from Bill.
  - Noted confusion over =
definitions (e.g., a script may be automated, but output validation is =
manual).

- **Action Items**
  - Team agrees to follow up with Bill for =
clarity, particularly regarding different test automation combinations and =
how these should be reported.
  - Suggestion to set up a 30-minute call =
with Bill, possibly by the end of the day.

### 2. Coordination and =
Assignment of Testers

- **Tracking Testers**
  - Paul is sending a =
=E2=80=9Ccensus file=E2=80=9D with tester names.
  - Max will match these =
names with existing lists to identify Athens users.

- **Tracking Defects**
  - Defect management is split: automated cases will be tracked in Tosca; =
manual cases will be tracked in a centralized manual tracker.
  - Separate processes for ERP, Finance, and HR (with HR data coming from =
ADP).

### 3. Integrations and Communication With Other Teams

- **HR Test Coordination**
  - Importance of connecting with ADP and =
identifying the correct UI/test coordination counterparts (i.e., =
communications with Vicky, William, Arpit).
  - Noted need to be included =
in ADP-related communications.

- **Setting Up Meetings and Ownership**
  - Discussion around who will facilitate/lead meetings, with suggestion =
for Pierce to be the primary contact for meetings, supported by others.

### 4. Next Steps and Scheduling

- Upcoming meeting proposed for later =
today (moved to 2:00pm) to regroup after coordinating within their teams.
- Vicki and another team member will continue conversations in the interim.
- Plan to send Pierce an email outlining expectations for meeting =
facilitation based on current week=E2=80=99s outcomes.

## Action Items and Follow-ups

1. **Clarify with Bill:**
   - Definitions of semi-automated, automated, manual test =
scripts/functions.
   - Details on processes and reporting for each type.

2. **Update Dashboard/Reporting:**
   - Add a column for 'testing type' to =
the execution status dashboard.
   - Create an appendix for a detailed =
breakdown by test type if needed.

3. **Sync on Testers and Defect =
Tracking:**
   - Match tester names from the census with the Athens list =
(Paul/Max).
   - Ensure manual and automated defect tracking processes are =
clear and assigned.

4. **HR Integration:**
   - Finalize point of contact =
and integration process with ADP/UI.

5. **Meeting Preparation:**
   - Follow up with Vicki and other stakeholders as meetings are =
rescheduled.
   - Draft communication to Pierce regarding expectations for =
upcoming meetings.

6. **Schedule Call With Bill:**
   - A 30-minute call to clarify test process definitions, ideally by the =
end of today, June 20, 2025.

Is something that doesn't pass.=
 It's really more a non passing of validation. It sounds like it's probably=
 a simpler fix than some of the manual ones.

0:10
Yeah.

0:14
Maybe, maybe, maybe that's where Jeff's mind's at. I'm just.

0:19
I think he just wanted to validate that we know how they're being tested =
and what like he, he wants to know that we have the underlying detailed =
plan of we know exactly in what order and the people who are doing the =
hands on keyboard work know, okay, I need to go in and I will hear from =
this person or whatever. However, the coordination works down to the =
individual person running the script level. Have we gotten the coordination=
 down? And so we could do that in the way that you mentioned. Jessica, to =
your point, with like the two, and I think to Jeff's point, the two UATs, =
the automated and the non automated or finance and ERP. I suggested to =
Rakesh earlier that we just add a column to the execution status dashboard =
with the testing type. Hold on one second.

1:28
So just thinking through =
that a bit. Maybe that's the direction go. Leave it in the overall but have=
 some level of breakouts showing what's automated, what's manual. I'm =
struggling a little.

1:44
Hold on, let me, I'm going to, I'll share my =
screen and just show you really quickly here. One second.

1:55
My original thought was just do a version of this automated version of this=
. It's manual. But maybe what we do is leave this and then do an automated =
versus manual and put it in the appendix so we can show that breakout if =
they want. I think just trying to glean insights into it because for =
example, on an automated system the idea of human failure is gone. It's =
likely not human failure, it's likely a defect somewhere in the background.=
 But in the manual system something fails. It could very well be because =
hey, Jessica hit the enter key instead of the submit key and so she didn't =
get the outcome she expected because she did it wrong. So I think that's =
what he's trying to glean from this is, you know, potential insights =
knowing something's automated versus manual. But I think he's going to want=
 more than just like a half and half. I think he's going to know like =
within those five scripts which ones are automated, which ones are not. Now=
 that I've said that out loud, maybe to your point, Rakash, within those =
five, like let's say I pick one script. Would you say maybe this is what I =
was processing to now within, let's say the one script you could have part =
of it be automated or part of it be manual. Or is each script like.

3:19
No, no, I think within a script it would be. I don't think that's what Bill=
 said. But so within, within the whole thing, I'm loading all 26 scripts =
for order management into Tasker and running it our end to end audit cache.=
 But within say logistics, I'm doing it all manual. And that could be. Yeah=
, yeah. So it's not a mix within a sub function.

3:55
I mean that's how finance denoted it in their, like our erp. So in the ERP =
file that we were looking at they went by function. And this was the one, =
the example that Jeff asked Bill for trading compliance and Bill talked him=
 through the testing.

4:24
Talk him through the process of testing.

4:27
No.

4:31
Day in the life.

4:33
Yeah. And, and what Bill described this. =
It, it said manual. What Bill described was semi automated.

4:41
Don't change that. Leave that to Bill. Let's validate with him. Because his=
, his latest tracker has a different view of it. So. But whatever it is, I =
get your point.

4:57
So they went to workstream.

5:00
So then semi automated shouldn't mean that. Okay, the scripts are automated=
. Maybe there's a manual validation that they hand off to a person and it =
wouldn't be. I don't know if he talked about particularly trade compliance,=
 but I know the ask he brought up was trade compliance, but this is where.

5:23
Yeah, but that's where I think we need to get better. Like all the =
ones that say fully manual. Sure, I get that. Sourcing tosca fully =
automated and manual, does that mean like some of those are automated and =
some are manual? Because he says on line 6 he says semi automated, but then=
 line 7 he says Tosca fully automated and manual.

5:48
So yeah, we need to get the clarity from him on what those mean. Now with =
to your process, if the automation is where it will fail, the manual is the=
 validation and the verification. So like the PO creation and ariva =
automated PO creation and SAP automated. You know, indirect PO in Compass, =
indirect in SAP, everything in SAP asset PO automated. I think it's the. =
Perhaps there are validations around it that they need to look at.

6:25
Yeah, he said like a user will be given a script to go run that creates a =
sales order, invoice or something and then they go deliver it to the pack =
and ship folks. So they'll deliver the output. So they'll run the script =
manually, but the test itself is automated and then they go validate the =
output further along in the process. Right. So it's like the test is. The =
script is automated, but the test is manual.

7:00
Let's ask those =
questions of him because then we can determine what level of reporting we =
need, whether we know you need to go to that level, or we call it, you know=
, automated. So I think it will influence or determine how we want to =
follow up, how we do that. So we do need now for manual. I think for =
finance, it works for. Just for Bill. We need to talk through this process =
and what each means.

7:27
So we need to get on the call with that, like 30=
 minutes and.

7:31
Maybe end of the. Yeah, sorry, I've got to step on this=
 other call. But yeah, the other part of this is the number of testers. So =
I've got Paul sending me some information on the census file of the names. =
So Max going to do a straight lookup against that and against our list to =
see which of those are Athens names. Oh, yes. So we'll take care of that. =
And then the defects also, we'll have to talk through then how we run the =
defects or how we would track the defects. Whatever's in Tosca is in Tosca.=
 Whatever is manual, we'll need to track in his. In our centralized manual =
tracker. Whether ERP or Finance, whatever is HR will come from adp. We need=
 to add that in there either as one per country. So we just need to.

8:25
On getting us in the loop with ADP if you want to. Also, I don't know who =
our UI counterparts.

8:33
You pinged Vicky on. On what? I'm sorry.

8:35
On adp.

8:36
Okay, okay, I know why.

8:41
Counterpart. Just start getting=
 us in the loop with that.

8:44
Yeah, we'll talk to William, Arpit and =
William. Okay, I know Sandra mentioned that and Kelly R. Mentioned that, =
but yeah, yeah, we'll talk to. And then the other piece of this obviously =
is the. He said how would we note who would be standing up the MOs. And I =
think talking through those things. I think we may need to run that to =
ground as well.

9:09
I think that Vicki and I, I want to. So we. The three=
 of us have a connect right now.

9:15
Do you.

9:15
Are you able to get on or.

9:17
I will. Oh, crap. I will in about half an =
hour.

9:22
That's fine. Go to. Go to your meeting. Vicki and I can =
continue talking. I think her and I are aligned because I think what we =
need to do is have Pierce be the face of this and we all be here to support=
 and like, I'll stand up some of the meetings, but we can just send Pierce =
email saying, hey, this is what we expect you to stand up based on how this=
 week's outcomes are. Yeah. So.

9:45
Okay, sounds good. We'll talk to you =
in a bit.

9:47
Sounds good. Thanks, guys.

9:48
Thank you.

9:49
Bye.

9:49
Bye.

10:06
It. Hey, man.

10:39
Hey.

10:42
Vicki did not jump on, =
but I also need to see if I can connect with somebody on my team. Let's do =
this. Because I need to connect with somebody on my team. I'm just going to=
 move this to two o' clock.

11:03
Perfect.

11:03
And I'll just regroup at=
 two.

11:05
Okay, that sounds great. Thank you. Thank you.

11:08
Bye.
