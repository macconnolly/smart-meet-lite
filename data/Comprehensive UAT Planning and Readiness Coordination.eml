Comprehensive UAT Planning and Readiness Coordination

Main Topics Discussed

1. **UAT Planning and Coordination**
    - The discussion centers on the structure and process for organizing =
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) across multiple functions and systems.
    - Emphasis is placed on:
        - Identifying UAT coordinators and =
leads for each function (e.g., finance, supply chain, IT, commercial).
        - Differentiating between function leads and future test leads, =
clarifying that for now, the focus is on identifying leads responsible for =
scoping, not the testers.
        - Sub-functions within finance include =
controllership, treasury, payroll, and benefits=E2=80=94each requiring a =
lead.
    - Explains the importance of cross-functional coordination, =
particularly for processes spanning multiple systems or functions (e.g., =
ERP modules intersecting with supply chain or commercial processes).
    - Tracking readiness involves creating a matrix similar to an overall =
program roles and responsibilities chart, ensuring all focal points are =
identified per workstream, tower, or function.

2. **Readiness and Scope =
Alignment**
    - The process includes identifying all relevant leads, =
setting up meetings, and aligning on:
        - Systems and processes in =
the testing scope.
        - Scenarios to be tested, including scenario and=
 script breakdowns (e.g., 1,000 processes reduced to 200 changes across =
systems, resulting in 100 scenarios and corresponding test scripts).
        - Status tracking: scripts defined, scripts to be modified, new =
scripts to develop.
    - Readiness is monitored through a tracker that =
confirms steps have been completed: person identified, alignment achieved, =
test assets (scripts/scenarios) ready, and timeline set.
        - UAT estimated window: generally from June 20 to July 15, with =
ERP-specific UAT from July 1 to July 15.
    - Planning includes ensuring =
environment and data readiness=E2=80=94e.g., having historical data =
available in QA environments by June 15.

3. **Gaps and Ownership**
    - Recognizes a gap in mapping processes to system =
gaps=E2=80=94sometimes a process touches more systems than IT or the =
function initially realizes.
    - Stresses the need for confirming =
comprehensive scope and close alignment between IT and functional teams to =
avoid overlooked areas.

4. **Management Operating Structure (MOS) and =
Cadence**
    - MOS refers to the management cadence=E2=80=94regular =
meetings and decision-making routines.
    - Each function or focal should =
set up regular meetings (cadence), with notes on incorporating these into =
the readiness structure.
    - Ensures alignment meetings are scheduled, =
with regular check-ins for ongoing tracking.

5. **Open Items/Action =
Items**
    - Schedule alignment meetings with all pillars; Mahim confirmed=
, others pending due to scheduling conflicts with town halls, etc.
    - Update on HANA change request: waiting on information from Rajesh =
(data and intelligence team), with action to respond in email thread to =
Pierce. Others possibly involved include Paul, Prashant, or Sakina.
    - Capital Edge report: updated metrics showing one item at risk and =
four delayed, down from nine earlier in the day and an improvement of two =
from the previous week.
    - Waterfall slide (Young=E2=80=99s): Intended =
to provide balance and insight for the SOW and resource planning for the =
=E2=80=9Cmove as-is=E2=80=9D effort; periodic update planned for Friday to =
present on Monday. Effort for in-depth analysis or resource allocation =
discussion on hold, pending further conversation later in the week.

6. **Follow-Up and Next Steps**
    - Provide structural template for UAT =
tracker so that ownership and status can be filled in.
    - Add dummy/demo data for context.
    - Await updates from Rajesh and =
team regarding the HANA request; respond to Pierce as soon as information =
is available.
    - Periodic update of Young=E2=80=99s waterfall slide by =
Friday.
    - Possible further alignment conversations between Sean and =
Rakesh later in the week.
    - Schedule and confirm pillar meetings as =
soon as availability is known.
    - End-of-day call coordination; =
additional short meeting planned after day=E2=80=99s end for progress =
review.

Relevant Dates and Figures

- UAT window: June 20 (6/20) to July =
15 (7/15) overall; ERP-specific UAT from July 1 (7/1) to July 15 (7/15).
- Data readiness (historical data for QA): Targeted by June 15 (6/15).
- Capital Edge report: 1 at-risk, 4 delayed issues as of today, down from 9=
 in the morning and 2 fewer than last week.
- Waterfall slide periodic =
update: Scheduled for Friday (for review on Monday).

Key Concepts

- Distinction between function leads (scoping and alignment) and test leads=
 (scenario execution).
- Process mapping needs to ensure all impacted =
systems are accounted for, even those initially considered out of scope.
- The readiness tracker should capture all necessary steps to ensure UAT is=
 set up for success: ownership, scope alignment, scenario/script readiness,=
 environment/data preparedness, cadence, and timelines.

Action Items

- Structure the tracker for functional and test readiness.
- Embed meeting cadences (Management Operating Structure) and ensure they =
are set per function/workstream.
- Confirm all focal leads, schedule =
meetings, and ensure all teams are aligned.
- Periodic updates and =
responses on HANA and Capital Edge to stakeholders.
- Continue with waterfall slide updates; further resource planning =
discussions pending follow-up meetings.

Outstanding Issues

- Awaiting response from Rajesh on HANA.
- Further resource and planning =
insights for =E2=80=9Cmove as-is=E2=80=9D initiative to be addressed later.

This summary provides an organized view of UAT planning, readiness =
tracking, open issues, and key next steps, capturing all key dates, metrics=
, and important process clarifications discussed in the transcript.

Whatever that other slide is on here, it might be a good =
starting point.

0:10
Yep.

0:12
So basically this could be like a starting=
 point. Obviously we'll modify it.

0:16
No, no, no, no, no. This comes all=
 down the lane. This is all like 10 weeks later. I'm talking now. So =
testers are comes later. Right now it's you are UAT coordinator, she is =
supply chain co, he is commercial coordinator. So it's identifying the =
leads, not the testers. It's peers is a UAT IT coordinator for function. So=
 for finance I got, you know, controllership, Treasury. What are the other =
ones in finance?

0:53
Payroll, whatever.

0:54
Yeah, right, okay. Payroll,=
 benefits, whatever. Right. So these are sub functions within the function =
of workstream. I need a lead, we need a lead for each of these. It's not =
UAT test leads. Test leads would be. I'm going to be working on this =
particular test scenario X and for this function I'm going to be testing it=
. Right. So this is really more for the leads, the function leads for ID =
and function. This is so once you identify and this is the oak example. So =
but this. So once you've got them, you've got to start tracking about, =
thinking about having conversations, the leads having conversations to =
understand the scope of what's there. So peers for it. In fact, this should=
 also be tower tower leads, if you will, or tower coordinators even within =
it. I'd like us to track functions can track their thing, but we need a =
matrix really matrix develop here. So similar to how we did for the overall=
 program roles and responsibilities. You got a point of contact for each =
work stream, a tower lead, IT, focal, whatever it is. So we need a focal =
identified for each of this in fact may not be leads.

2:25
But wasn't that what the PMO was doing? Oh, I thought we had that already.

2:30
No, PMO may have a portion of it, but we need to track it though. =
Right. So focal identify. We need. Once these guys are identified, they =
need to talk through and understand what are the systems in scope and what =
are the processes in scope. So they need to have that alignment on scope =
and they need to be able to identify. This is at high level. We may want to=
 break it down further into one or two steps here. Right, but alignment on =
scope and then alignment on scenarios. Again, scenarios will come from =
business, but alignment on test scenario test cases and then alignment. So =
once they've had that. So the case in point bill a schw. This is where the =
cross functional thing happens because erp, he's only looking at ERP module=
 but a commercial or supply Chain guy or an end to end guy will say, okay, =
some things are outside erp, some things end with erp. So for the cases in =
erp, I need to go talk to Bill. But for the cases outside erp, that guy may=
 need to. Or girl may need to go talk to somebody else. So it's really =
coordinating what is from an end to end person coordinating with each of =
the IT functions. So there's a bit of thought involved here, but the point =
is still that I have a thousand cases, a thousand cases, thousand processes=
. And I'm only filtering out 200 that change. And they're across, let's say=
 supply chain, ERP, HR, whatever, finance. Okay. And out of these, this =
essentially says, okay, I'm aligning here, I got, you know, 20 processes =
across seven systems that I need to test here. And I've got test cases for =
these. These 20 processes correspond to say 100 scenarios and in scope for =
testing. And there may be, you know, scenarios that come in here as well. =
But the hundred scenarios that need to be tested, I've got 23 scripts =
defined, or you know, let's say 53 scripts in place. I've got 17 scripts to=
 be modified and I've got to have, you know, 60, 40 new scripts to develop.=
 Okay, so that's what we're trying to track through these metrics to say, =
okay, have I identified the person? Have they talked to each other between =
IT and the functions to say this down. Selection for supply chain is =
happened and I've identified the 20 and 7. Am I aligned on what is in scope=
 here? Have I aligned on a timeline to develop, you know, to develop the =
scripts and tools to use? Right. So that's the readiness tracker that he =
can go chase and say, have you done this? Have you met, have you defined =
this? Have you done this? Execution of it is per this slide here that says,=
 what is my entry criteria and exit criteria? Six weeks down the lane for =
defining, you know, you could also have a secondary layer of tracking in =
here and say, okay, when you're ready. This is, I would call this UAT =
planning or readiness. Right. The other piece of this is execution =
readiness is have I, you know, if I want to add on things to the right, =
have I defined exit entry.

6:21
And exit criteria, UAT planning readiness.

6:26
So he as peers needs at a high level, needs to be able to track =
across the functions and say, you guys are behind. You're starting your UAT=
 on middle of June. Have you even identified focals you could even to your =
point, you said of test leads, if you Want to add that in here and say =
there's a subsection of here, let's say the focal. Let's say controllership=
. I won't know these unless I finish the scenarios.

6:55
Then you won't know who the test is.

6:56
I won't know who the test lead =
is. Right, so there's a test lead somewhere in here.

6:59
Yeah, got it.

7:00
And maybe there's a timeline aligned. Right. But the point being at a =
high level. So this is kind of what I'm thinking and the way we've had the =
conversation to say, have you done these 10 steps to know that you're now =
ready to conduct your testing?

7:16
Okay.

7:20
With me so far. Yeah.

7:23
Does he need, like, what. How filled out does it need to be? Like, =
does he want.

7:29
We need the structure for him to go fill it out?

7:32
Yeah. So.

7:33
Right. So we don't know.

7:34
Yeah, no, no. I, I was. I =
think we're on the same page there, but yeah, we just need the structure of=
 saying these are the steps of what you actually need to do.

7:41
Yeah. Okay.

7:43
I don't know what the dates are. The dates I would assume=
 are gonna be nuanced based off of each different application itself.

7:48
Or you could. Yeah, if this is per function.

7:51
Yeah, you could back out=
.

7:52
You can back out and say, okay, I need the timeline alignment. I =
need. We know generally UAT is somewhere like 620 to 715. In some cases, =
like ERP, it's 7.1 to 715. The idea here is we're trying to understand how =
ready are they with, from a process perspective to ready to test from a =
systems perspective. We're also trying to understand how ready are you with=
 the environment and data. So that's the other piece of this is alignment =
on scenarios, maybe alignment on timing or readiness. Right. So timing, =
timing of readiness, timing of, let's say environment data. Because you =
could say, okay, I need historical data to test this scenario. It. I've =
defined a scenario. You're telling me the QA environment is going to be =
ready. Can you get that data, historical data, and put it in there by 615?

9:00
We mentioned from my notes, I had process mapping to system gaps. =
Which piece is that? Alignment with scope.

9:07
So what they're doing is =
this part and saying, I have 200 processes, but the 200 processes are going=
 to touch across six or seven systems. It may not know that those systems =
are being touched. It may think only two systems. From an IT centric =
perspective, they're going to say, I only have three systems in supply =
chain that are changing. That's okay. But for a process change, it may pass=
 through a system that's not changing. So it will still need to be aware =
and finalize what the scope of that thing is. So if a process is changing =
and it touches a system that is not in their list, you still need to test =
it out. But they may think, oh, the systems that are truly changing are for=
 others. So that's the alignment piece where they do the mapping and they =
say I've got 200 processes, but they touch eight systems. You guys have =
only five systems in scope. Add these other three. So that's the Srinivas =
and somebody else. And another piece Srinivas from ERP and somebody else. =
But that's the alignment and scope between it plus.

10:11
Yeah. Function.

10:12
Function.

10:13
And that's where he said that there was a gap.

10:15
Nobody huge gap because they're not confirmed it up or.

10:19
Yeah.

10:19
Who leads this? Right. Or have this may be broken up a bit more into.=
 Have you set it up? Have you completed.

10:25
Right.

10:26
So meeting setup, alignment complete. Yeah. So meeting setup, alignment =
complete.

10:33
I mean are those one offs or is that. Can you do that as =
part of like a cadence? Can you set up like a cadence with these four or =
five?

10:40
Part of this is mo. Maybe that's another one here you hear the=
 term movie.

10:44
Yeah. What is mos?

10:45
MOS is called Management =
operating structure. It's essentially a cadence.

10:49
Okay.

10:49
It's a meeting cadence and how they operate.

10:55
Hey, it's like a Honeywell.

10:58
I wrote Management operating System. So =
no, no structures.

11:02
Yeah, but basically just like how do they =
actually have meetings execute?

11:07
How do you make decisions? How do =
you. It's a project, it's a. Yeah, okay, but that could be part of the =
cadence setup, right? Somewhere in here on have a cadence set up, have a =
structure in place. How often do you communicate?

11:21
Right.

11:21
So maybe as part of this meeting they decide we're gonna talk to you every =
week. Okay. That may be part of this is the alignment is also we say =
alignment, you know, meeting setup or meeting completed MOS setup or scope.

11:36
And this is per focal like the rose per function.

11:40
So in each the rows are.

11:43
By the way, shouldn't we drink?

11:44
Join the end of day call?

11:45
Yeah.

11:48
Let'S. After the day, let's. =
Let's talk for like 10 minutes.

11:50
Yeah, we should join the call.

11:52
I gotta focus on something really quick for the next 10 minutes. But =
yeah, maybe grab a room and.

11:57
I want to make sure we give him =
something in the morning that is good enough for him to go chase.

12:02
Oh, we will.

12:02
It's okay that it's empty but we have some views that =
we do.

12:07
We should have like a, a dummy data or like some kind of like=
 dummy definitely. Yeah but we can, we can work through like the different =
steps and see what we need to add in.

12:18
Do you want to pass me if =
you're going somewhere?

12:20
Oh yeah.

12:23
Where's the or you already =
plugged in under sk.

12:26
You can have it ask you want plug in.

12:42
Has anyone else's teams or laptop in general been complete lately? Yeah, =
yeah this co pilot. Co pilot are in my teams and I don't know what's. Well,=
 everything else.

13:09
Okay, sounds perfect. And then have you got the. =
The meeting scheduled with all the pillar as well at least on their =
calendars?

13:20
No.

13:21
So Mahim.

13:22
Yes for others. I'm just =
checking with them on their availability. It seems there are a lot of town =
halls and everything.

13:45
Around available funds planning to this =
morning? No, we have not had a chance to connect yet. Okay so those are the=
 two open items for today we had on the left side. And then Justin, I know =
that you were kind of. You were doing two things. One was tracking down =
where the HANA change request is at in the process. And you're gonna go can=
 respond back to Pierce. Did you ever figure out what was going on with =
that? No. So.

14:19
We think it's coming from the data and intelligence =
team. So Rajesh, unfortunately he doesn't usually reply to his pings. We're=
 not. I don't think anyone right now that's in office is cc'd in any emails=
 regarding Hana. So I'm waiting for Rajesh, but I think it has to be in =
either Paul Prashant or Sakina's inbox.

14:50
Okay, then we'll have to =
check out. We'll have to roll back on this one in the morning to respond in=
 that email thread with that message to Pierce so that we tie that off with=
 him today because we did say we would go back to him. So I just wanted to =
make sure he has an update and knows that we've been kind of working that =
throughout the day.

15:10
Yeah, yeah. And along with that, I'm about to =
send them the updated Capital Edge report.

15:18
And how many did we land =
on? How many issues that are delayed or at risk that we land on? I know we =
had nine this morning, but that number had been coming down throughout the =
day.

15:33
Yeah, yeah, we're. We're gonna be at one at risk and four =
delays.

15:37
Okay, very. So from last week as well?

15:40
Yeah, two down from last week.

15:42
Okay, that sounds perfect. And Then =
Rakesh, there was one item for you today. I know that you were working to =
take Young's waterfall slide and start to build back some of the insights =
because we know the Honeywell team is not appropriately staffed for build =
back and move as his efforts. Where are we at on that?

16:04
They can hear you.

16:08
I think that was after a conversation with Sean. =
I don't think we're anywhere. No progress on it. The waterfall was simply =
not to build back or re engineer it. It was really to understand what was =
the balance that we can then use as information when we develop the sow. So=
 we're talking. Sean and I are having a conversation later today and we'll.=
 It may be later in the week before we get a view in it. But the context of=
 this was that the waterfall slide is there but that that needs a periodic =
update for Sukai. So we spoke about that being updated Friday so we can =
present over Monday.

16:53
Yeah, no, those are. Those are two separate. =
That was one. Number one on the left side and number four on the left side.=
 And number one. Yes, we're aligned on that. That's going to be updated =
periodically. Number four was related to the. The piece for shot. Okay, so =
that's where I have the question because we said that we would have that =
kind of at some place today but it sounds like it's going to be something =
later in the leak so we'll push that out.

17:17
Yeah, yeah. It's not a =
timeline based. It's the fact that. So I don't want to conflate two things =
that the use of the waterfall was just to discover that there are funds =
available. The move as is application and the effort is a resource or quest=
 that we need to add into it.

data-id=3D"react-email-markdown"><p>Main Topics Discussed</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">UAT Planning and =
Coordination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The discussion centers on the structure =
and process for organizing User Acceptance Testing (UAT) across multiple =
functions and systems.</li>
<li>Emphasis is placed on:<ul>
<li>Identifying UAT coordinators and leads for each function (e.g., finance=
, supply chain, IT, commercial).</li>
<li>Differentiating between function =
leads and future test leads, clarifying that for now, the focus is on =
identifying leads responsible for scoping, not the testers.</li>
<li>Sub-functions within finance include controllership, treasury, payroll,=
 and benefits=E2=80=94each requiring a lead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explains the importance of cross-functional coordination, particularly =
for processes spanning multiple systems or functions (e.g., ERP modules =
intersecting with supply chain or commercial processes).</li>
<li>Tracking readiness involves creating a matrix similar to an overall =
program roles and responsibilities chart, ensuring all focal points are =
identified per workstream, tower, or function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Readiness and Scope =
Alignment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The process includes identifying all =
relevant leads, setting up meetings, and aligning on:<ul>
<li>Systems and processes in the testing scope.</li>
<li>Scenarios to be tested, including scenario and script breakdowns (e.g.,=
 1,000 processes reduced to 200 changes across systems, resulting in 100 =
scenarios and corresponding test scripts).</li>
<li>Status tracking: =
scripts defined, scripts to be modified, new scripts to develop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Readiness is monitored through a tracker that confirms steps have=
 been completed: person identified, alignment achieved, test assets =
(scripts/scenarios) ready, and timeline set.<ul>
<li>UAT estimated window: =
generally from June 20 to July 15, with ERP-specific UAT from July 1 to =
July 15.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Planning includes ensuring environment and =
data readiness=E2=80=94e.g., having historical data available in QA =
environments by June 15.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">Gaps and Ownership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizes a gap in mapping processes to system gaps=E2=80=94sometimes =
a process touches more systems than IT or the function initially realizes.=
</li>
<li>Stresses the need for confirming comprehensive scope and close =
alignment between IT and functional teams to avoid overlooked areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Management Operating =
Structure (MOS) and Cadence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MOS refers to the =
management cadence=E2=80=94regular meetings and decision-making routines.=
</li>
<li>Each function or focal should set up regular meetings (cadence), =
with notes on incorporating these into the readiness structure.</li>
<li>Ensures alignment meetings are scheduled, with regular check-ins for =
ongoing tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold=
">Open Items/Action Items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule alignment meetings=
 with all pillars; Mahim confirmed, others pending due to scheduling =
conflicts with town halls, etc.</li>
<li>Update on HANA change request: =
waiting on information from Rajesh (data and intelligence team), with =
action to respond in email thread to Pierce. Others possibly involved =
include Paul, Prashant, or Sakina.</li>
<li>Capital Edge report: updated =
metrics showing one item at risk and four delayed, down from nine earlier =
in the day and an improvement of two from the previous week.</li>
<li>Waterfall slide (Young=E2=80=99s): Intended to provide balance and =
insight for the SOW and resource planning for the =E2=80=9Cmove =
as-is=E2=80=9D effort; periodic update planned for Friday to present on =
Monday. Effort for in-depth analysis or resource allocation discussion on =
hold, pending further conversation later in the week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Follow-Up and Next =
Steps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide structural template for UAT tracker so =
that ownership and status can be filled in.</li>
<li>Add dummy/demo data =
for context.</li>
<li>Await updates from Rajesh and team regarding the HANA=
 request; respond to Pierce as soon as information is available.</li>
<li>Periodic update of Young=E2=80=99s waterfall slide by Friday.</li>
<li>Possible further alignment conversations between Sean and Rakesh later =
in the week.</li>
<li>Schedule and confirm pillar meetings as soon as =
availability is known.</li>
<li>End-of-day call coordination; additional =
short meeting planned after day=E2=80=99s end for progress review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Relevant Dates and Figures</p>
<ul>
<li>UAT window: June 20 (6/20) to July 15 (7/15) overall; ERP-specific UAT =
from July 1 (7/1) to July 15 (7/15).</li>
<li>Data readiness (historical =
data for QA): Targeted by June 15 (6/15).</li>
<li>Capital Edge report: 1 =
at-risk, 4 delayed issues as of today, down from 9 in the morning and 2 =
fewer than last week.</li>
<li>Waterfall slide periodic update: Scheduled =
for Friday (for review on Monday).</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Concepts</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinction between function leads (scoping and alignment) and test =
leads (scenario execution).</li>
<li>Process mapping needs to ensure all =
impacted systems are accounted for, even those initially considered out of =
scope.</li>
<li>The readiness tracker should capture all necessary steps to=
 ensure UAT is set up for success: ownership, scope alignment, =
scenario/script readiness, environment/data preparedness, cadence, and =
timelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Action Items</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure the tracker =
for functional and test readiness.</li>
<li>Embed meeting cadences =
(Management Operating Structure) and ensure they are set per =
function/workstream.</li>
<li>Confirm all focal leads, schedule meetings, =
and ensure all teams are aligned.</li>
<li>Periodic updates and responses =
on HANA and Capital Edge to stakeholders.</li>
<li>Continue with waterfall =
slide updates; further resource planning discussions pending follow-up =
meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outstanding Issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Awaiting response from Rajesh on HANA.</li>
<li>Further resource and =
planning insights for =E2=80=9Cmove as-is=E2=80=9D initiative to be =
addressed later.</li>
</ul>
<p>This summary provides an organized view of =
UAT planning, readiness tracking, open issues, and key next steps, =
capturing all key dates, metrics, and important process clarifications =
discussed in the transcript.</p>

it&#x27;s identifying the leads, not the testers. It&#x27;s peers is a UAT =

It&#x27;s not UAT test leads. Test leads would be. I&#x27;m going to be =
working on this particular test scenario X and for this function I&#x27;m =
going to be testing it. Right. So this is really more for the leads, the =
function leads for ID and function. This is so once you identify and this =
is the oak example. So but this. So once you&#x27;ve got them, you&#x27;ve =
got to start tracking about, thinking about having conversations, the leads=
 having conversations to understand the scope of what&#x27;s there. So =
peers for it. In fact, this should also be tower tower leads, if you will, =
or tower coordinators even within it. I&#x27;d like us to track functions =
can track their thing, but we need a matrix really matrix develop here. So =
similar to how we did for the overall program roles and responsibilities. =
You got a point of contact for each work stream, a tower lead, IT, focal, =
whatever it is. So we need a focal identified for each of this in fact may =
not be leads.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;padding:16px;back=

6">No, PMO may have a portion of it, but we need to track it though. Right.=
 So focal identify. We need. Once these guys are identified, they need to =
talk through and understand what are the systems in scope and what are the =
processes in scope. So they need to have that alignment on scope and they =
need to be able to identify. This is at high level. We may want to break it=
 down further into one or two steps here. Right, but alignment on scope and=
 then alignment on scenarios. Again, scenarios will come from business, but=
 alignment on test scenario test cases and then alignment. So once =
they&#x27;ve had that. So the case in point bill a schw. This is where the =
cross functional thing happens because erp, he&#x27;s only looking at ERP =
module but a commercial or supply Chain guy or an end to end guy will say, =
okay, some things are outside erp, some things end with erp. So for the =
cases in erp, I need to go talk to Bill. But for the cases outside erp, =
that guy may need to. Or girl may need to go talk to somebody else. So =
it&#x27;s really coordinating what is from an end to end person =
coordinating with each of the IT functions. So there&#x27;s a bit of =
thought involved here, but the point is still that I have a thousand cases,=
 a thousand cases, thousand processes. And I&#x27;m only filtering out 200 =
that change. And they&#x27;re across, let&#x27;s say supply chain, ERP, HR,=
 whatever, finance. Okay. And out of these, this essentially says, okay, =
I&#x27;m aligning here, I got, you know, 20 processes across seven systems =
that I need to test here. And I&#x27;ve got test cases for these. These 20 =
processes correspond to say 100 scenarios and in scope for testing. And =
there may be, you know, scenarios that come in here as well. But the =
hundred scenarios that need to be tested, I&#x27;ve got 23 scripts defined,=
 or you know, let&#x27;s say 53 scripts in place. I&#x27;ve got 17 scripts =
to be modified and I&#x27;ve got to have, you know, 60, 40 new scripts to =
develop. Okay, so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to track through these=
 metrics to say, okay, have I identified the person? Have they talked to =
each other between IT and the functions to say this down. Selection for =
supply chain is happened and I&#x27;ve identified the 20 and 7. Am I =
aligned on what is in scope here? Have I aligned on a timeline to develop, =
you know, to develop the scripts and tools to use? Right. So that&#x27;s =
the readiness tracker that he can go chase and say, have you done this? =
Have you met, have you defined this? Have you done this? Execution of it is=
 per this slide here that says, what is my entry criteria and exit criteria=
? Six weeks down the lane for defining, you know, you could also have a =
secondary layer of tracking in here and say, okay, when you&#x27;re ready. =
This is, I would call this UAT planning or readiness. Right. The other =
piece of this is execution readiness is have I, you know, if I want to add =
on things to the right, have I defined exit entry.</div></div><div =

We&#x27;re also trying to understand how ready are you with the environment=

say, okay, I need historical data to test this scenario. It. I&#x27;ve =

 doing is this part and saying, I have 200 processes, but the 200 processes=
 are going to touch across six or seven systems. It may not know that those=
 systems are being touched. It may think only two systems. From an IT =
centric perspective, they&#x27;re going to say, I only have three systems =
in supply chain that are changing. That&#x27;s okay. But for a process =
change, it may pass through a system that&#x27;s not changing. So it will =
still need to be aware and finalize what the scope of that thing is. So if =
a process is changing and it touches a system that is not in their list, =
you still need to test it out. But they may think, oh, the systems that are=

they do the mapping and they say I&#x27;ve got 200 processes, but they =

after a conversation with Sean. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re anywhere. No =
progress on it. The waterfall was simply not to build back or re engineer =
it. It was really to understand what was the balance that we can then use =
as information when we develop the sow. So we&#x27;re talking. Sean and I =
are having a conversation later today and we&#x27;ll. It may be later in =
the week before we get a view in it. But the context of this was that the =
waterfall slide is there but that that needs a periodic update for Sukai. =
So we spoke about that being updated Friday so we can present over Monday.=

 Those are two separate. That was one. Number one on the left side and =
number four on the left side. And number one. Yes, we&#x27;re aligned on =
that. That&#x27;s going to be updated periodically. Number four was related=
 to the. The piece for shot. Okay, so that&#x27;s where I have the question=
 because we said that we would have that kind of at some place today but it=
 sounds like it&#x27;s going to be something later in the leak so =
we&#x27;ll push that out.</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:0;padding:=

It&#x27;s not a timeline based. It&#x27;s the fact that. So I don&#x27;t =
want to conflate two things that the use of the waterfall was just to =
discover that there are funds available. The move as is application and the=
 effort is a resource or quest that we need to add into it.=
