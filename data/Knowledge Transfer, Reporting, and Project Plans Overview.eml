Jason0:12
To what our point of view has been. So we align the knowledge transfer
related to that. So we're going to provide 800 hours of knowledge transfer.
They sent us a list of the documents that they want created. We told them
we will not create those. So what they agreed to do is they will create the
documents themselves. Their people will create them. They will populate all
the material in there. They will send a final draft to us for review, and
as part of the 800 hours, we will review those and provide updates to the
documents that we see fit or that need to be made. So transfers now in the
books, invoice level of details. Angie agreed to quarterly at the. At the
cost sharing level, quarterly forecast and actuals at the cost sharing
level. And they also agree to relieve the monthly. The monthly variance. So
that's now off that as well too.
Angie1:18
Okay, so I don't have to do monthly variance, I just have to do the
quarterly invoice.
Jason1:24
Correct, Quarterly. And then we'll have to do quarterly forecasting.
Angie1:28
Right, Right. But everything becomes quarterly now. Nothing is monthly, so
no monthly variance statement.
Jason1:36
Yeah, so leave it as is for now. We need to memorialize it, but it's coming=
.
Angie1:42
Okay. And Jason, now that you largely aligned on bts, I know that was one
of the triggers for changing the rate at which we build them labor. Are we
now to need to revisit the $160 an hour?
Jason1:58
We need to discuss that internally. I think we will, but we need to discuss
that internally.
Angie2:03
Okay.
Jason2:05
Yeah, good question. And then the invoice level, detail, name and what am I
forgetting? No, I think. I think Justin, you. You covered it. Oh,
integrations. Yes.
Mark2:20
So they.
Jason2:21
They are. We. They are choosing option number two, which is putting
customer portal and printing back in scope of clone and clan clone cleanse.
We sat down with them and had a kind of a, you know, discussion, a risk
level discussion to make sure they understood where. What our point of view
was. They. They weren't understanding what our point of view was. You could
kind of tell, and let me know if you agree to disagree. You could tell they
were seeing our points, but there are some external factors on their side
that's pushing to option two. What we believe and what the legal team
believes is, is that they're pushing for option two because that puts the
risk of go live on us. So we, right now we're at option two. They're
supposed to come back to it and let us know, but they said they were 95%
sure they were going to stick a stage with option Table.
Jen3:14
Jason, remind that day one plus 19 months. He's still 19. Yeah. Okay.
Mark3:22
No other, no other little herb balls in there for that, Jason?
Jason3:27
No. So we told them with option two guys, you know, they're going to be
without an X class in normal life solution for a period of time.
Mark3:34
Okay.
Jason3:35
They're like, yeah, we understand. And then I, I said, okay, you know,
that's fine. And so we kind of walked through that, the pros and cons. But
there's definitely some external factors in play.
Mark3:48
No class light then. You didn't put out that on the table.
Jason3:51
No, no, we'll have to have that marked to work while it's in our network
live on our network. We'll have to have that X class light live on our
network so that they can do it. But once it's a hard network, they don't
get X class class light. Okay, we can talk about that more, Mark. If, if
there's a way for them to do the classifications without X class light, we
could go that route too.
Mark4:20
Yeah, for sure.
Jason4:22
Okay, so does that make the class light just throw away then for those
three months while they're on our network? Yeah. Okay, Mark, we'll talk
about that more.
Mark4:33
Yeah, the other, the other thing, I guess. Can I go back to knowledge
transfer?
Jason4:39
Yeah.
Mark4:40
Ask a quick question on that.
Jason4:41
Yeah.
Mark4:42
So is that going to be run out of the PMO SMO or is that going to run at
the individual functional. I mean, is there any details on how we're going
to manage that overall and when that hits? I mean, was it just the fact we
agreed to do it for so many hours? We just need to work out the plan how
we're going to support. Facilitated still.
Jason5:03
That's exactly right, Mark. We have. So we have that. So we're going to
have to work with Agency really on two things related to additional time
tracking. One is knowledge transfer. Another one is going to be the new
requirement for the distribution center. So we're going to have to track,
you know, some additional time with Kelly and Ant for two additional venues=
.
Jen5:24
We think separate hard codes for those two. Thinking right, Jason? Maybe.
I'm sorry, Separate charge codes maybe for those two charged bucket.
Helen5:34
Two months.
Jen5:34
I think we're gonna do that for the DC anyway separately.
Jason5:37
Look, so let's. We need a meeting to really discuss this. So J. Can you or
the came up. You set that up by Angie Caspinary. Kelly's in there too?
Helen5:49
Yep.
Jen5:50
She's not back home.
Jason5:55
Yeah, I don't think it's terrific. Urgent within the Next two to three
weeks.
Mark5:58
Okay, so they distribution center plan as well.
Jason6:03
Yeah, they've accepted the bid.
Mark6:06
Okay good. Well they haven't approved it yet. Right. Are they.
Jason6:11
They've approved our bid.
Mark6:13
Oh, they approved the bid. Okay. So we are doing that. Okay, gotcha, gotcha=
.
Jason6:16
Okay.
Jen6:18
And we need to cut a PO pretty soon for the infrastructure piece of that
bed. Rachel. Correct. It's like next week that for the distribution center
piece of it. I think we need a kickoff to be able to identify and discuss
what we have in scope and if it was awarded what it's going to take since
it is an approval process now to figure out who's going to be working it. I
don't know if we're there yet on the hardware portion on the distribution
centerpiece.
Jason6:52
I think Jen, if you're referring to the email from this morning, that's on
crc. That's a separate response.
Jen6:58
I'm getting a little confused.
Mark6:59
Yeah, that's a different thing. Yeah.
Jen7:02
Okay, gotcha. Never mind.
Mark7:03
This is seriously. That leads one last question I had Jason is So they
bought 5:30. 5:30 is the gate.
Jason7:12
So Mark, that's a good question. I wouldn't say 5:30 is locked in 100% sure
right now but we have to work.
Mark7:23
Oh yeah. Just beat his earlier point. Everybody's on target with that
ramifications for staging coming quickly. If we do not do 5:30 we can't, we
shouldn't wait till 5:29 to make that decision.
Jason7:41
So Mark, last Mona was pushing on that, on them, on, on steer co executives
last week and we said hey ideally we want to know four weeks ahead of 5:30
if it's not going to be 5:30aminimum of two weeks.
Mark7:58
We're just so close to that now it's scary. We're going to send out those
cons out.
Jason8:02
Yeah. So. So no comms, no comms are related to this. If you go out right
now. Okay.
Mark8:08
Yeah, no, no, we're not sending. I mean we're prepping those comms. I just.
Yeah, we're getting close enough for that four week moment.
Jen8:16
It's@smoforapproval.com and I want to be very.
Jason8:21
Clear, no comment goes out right. Related to, related to the SAP outage
right now.
Jen8:27
It is true, Jen. It is at the SMO. But the SMOs responded. Cynthia was on
that and they're the ones that held. They said let's hold for a little bit,
you know.
Mark8:39
Yeah, makes sense.
Jason8:42
So I'm working that with the SMO and with this Meeting and I are working on
with the SMO and then I'm going to probably take it to Mona early next week
because the business has to start planning for it big time. Okay.
Jen9:02
Mark, was that your question in regards to the knowledge training? I
thought it was or did Jason answer it? I thought it was something in
regards to the 800 hours of knowledge training.
Mark9:15
For me.
Jen9:16
Yeah.
Mark9:17
It's just I, I kind of get it but I didn't know how we're going to
facilitate it. You know, organized organizationally and if it's, if it's
going to have its own like group to kind of work it. They own PM and own.
It's just, it just has to be organized well enough or do we take it and
digest it into our individual functions to try and get it done? It feels
like that's kind of a bigger task. I, I just, that's to be planned, I guess=
.
Jen9:45
Yeah. To be planned. We haven't. Those are good options. I know we were
talking about it as well and it will be like for the 40 apps, you know, as
part of the Pullman cleanse. But your idea about. Because they get absorbed
into each of the app role or is it just a separate. We haven't necessarily
thought, thought that yet.
Mark10:05
Yeah. And there's got to be pretty, some kind of. If they're writing up the
stuff. I mean that seems like an investment for us to be able to proofread
and balance sheet some things. There's just, just a whole. All kinds. It's
a separate swim lane. For sure.
Jen10:19
Yeah, for sure.
Jason10:20
I'm glad we.
Mark10:21
I've got a guy line of sight too. It's good, it's good for Step and.
Jason10:24
We are still on the hooks to provide them the project level documentation
that we're creating. So we need to make sure that we're creating that and
we're, we're providing that to them as, as we get through it and it's done
right.
Jen10:43
By that, Jason, do you mean like the training documents for the project
level documentation?
Jason10:49
No, I mean the like the design documents. Documents are our level. Whatever
we create as part of our project processes, we need to provide that to
them. So it needs to be definitely, you know, high level quality. Not that
anything we don't do is high level quality. It just. We have to make sure
our documentation is peer reviewed. It's, it's, it's, it's set and it's,
it's in good shape.
Jen11:13
Okay. Okay. Next on the agenda is our weekly meetings for Thursdays. So
I've Asked the teams to be able to go off and update, making sure that the
heat maps which are in confluence are up to date based on our Cap Edge work
plans. So big push there for everyone to ensure that those dates are
accurate and they align. I know that some have like more than just our SDLC
life cycles in there, but the important ones are going to be our UAT and
our cutover timing. So those columns you guys are going to be used for
feeders into the cutover plan as well as there's a new board that we're
creating that's going to be showing all of the applications basically being
turned off and what our percent complete is going to be that we could
utilize for our goal live date. So the heat maps here are going to be very
influential to ensure that they're accurate for anything that is still
active that hasn't had a cutover before, let's say 529. So we're going into
that, that our weekend of cutover, we are going to ask for cutover plans
for each one of those. So maybe that's another incentive to be able to
complete soon, sooner and then we wouldn't necessarily have to see that
international team. I know that you guys have a very large board, so it's
not, we're not going to recreate your boards but utilize what you have
there to be able to pull up and then we can do a summation. But again, for
anything for cutting over the weekend of, we are going to be looking at
those cutover plans as well. Right. And then Noah, who's leading cutover,
is going to be working with William, the team and Frenchie and Nicole as
well to make sure that we have that in one centralized location that we can
have for a cutover weekend as well. And Jen, I know that you're working on
the Hypercare plans as well that would be leveraged off of that after.
Yeah. So big focus on Thursday's meeting in regards to heat maps and just
making sure that those are up to date. Does anybody have any questions?
Okay, the last area is uat, which I know as of last night or Friday night's
updates, we were at 71. I want to say what we're at 78 last night. So
that's great. There are some areas that are a little bit behind that. I
know that Nicole's working hand in hand with people to able to recover on
those areas. But thank you very much for the extra hard work to be able to
ensure that, you know, that things are being executed well and that you're
answering questions. I know it's a lot. Two more weeks left I have not
heard or seen. I did hear but you know about people adding additional UAT
tests but, but I've not seen it and I think it was more related around HSC
PMO tasks and just where we don't have a real clear visibility into that
yet. But I don't, I haven't seen or heard anything about additional test
scripts that needed to be added. It was more of like a concern on those
areas, which is good news. I see that. Jen, Nicole, Noah, Chris, you guys
are all working on the exit cross criteria and we have briefed the SMO in
regards to being able to do a two in the box sign off. So that will
indicate that their teams that number one, they're all inclusive of the
test scripts that they wanted to be tested and number two that they have
been completed and meet their standards based on the run rates. Like there
was only 53 out of 10,000 scripts that had failed which had then been like
replanned and, and retest it again. So the testing is showing favorable
results. So we'll be working on those packages to be able to get approvals
on that. Does anybody have any questions? Yeah, we'll bring those to the
end of day call this week one of them and see what the feedback is.
Excellent, thanks. All right, that's all that we have on the agenda. Does
anybody have anything else that we missed that you guys wanted to talk
about?
Helen15:51
There's just one thing, Christina, if you don't mind. Sure. So we were just
doing a preparation call today for Hypercare and for the site leads at each
of the sites in terms of what the expectations are and what the site lead
each of the site needs to do and just making sure that we've got everything
well defined for that hypercare period. One of the questions that was
raised, we'll have a bridge obviously for Hypercare and we'll have a team's
chat. I think that went well when they did Hornet for the team. But we also
raised whether or not we should have a general mailbox as well so that we
can send like repeat mail messages. You know, if we sent instructions to
one person, we can send instructions to another person using that mailbox
and it all comes back into the one mailbox rather than the individuals. And
we've got that audit trail as well of what we've provided. But we wanted to
know whether because the mailbox seems quite old fashioned but we feel like
it's something that we would need but I don't think they use that on
Hornet. So I just wanted to get people's views.
Jason17:32
Hey, Helen.
Brenton17:33
I'm not quite understanding the mailbox.
Helen17:37
So if, say, for instance, someone needs to do something in terms of logging
in their emails not working, so we need them to say, delete their profile.
Brenton. We might just have a standard set of instructions. So we could
just use that mailbox to send those instructions, not each site lead, not
create their own.
Brenton18:04
Oh, so you want to send as this mailbox?
Helen18:07
Yes, yes. So, and then any responses or if something's not working, you
know, any of the team, it might be that they're all quiet in France, no
issues, but then in Wolverhampton they're really busy and somebody, you
know, one of the other site leads might be able to just pick it up and be
able to respond and then just having that audit trail as well of what's
been communicated and I think we would quite like to do, but I think
generally raised a few concerns or you weren't sure that it was the right
thing to do.
Jen18:50
When did you get feedback from?
Brenton18:54
I guess my feedback in general, I don't like shared mailboxes, but that's
just me. So I see where you're going with this. The technicians would have
to have access to it to be able to send ads.
Helen19:06
Yeah.
Brenton19:07
Then we want to make sure that they're monitoring it as well too. So they
got another mailbox to monitor. That's what I don't like about it.
Helen19:14
But the site lead on who's responsible for Hypercare would look at it.
Jen19:21
Yeah. It wouldn't be like somebody on the floor of a workstation. Right.
Necessarily. It would be two layers and it.
Brenton19:32
Would just be one mailbox that everyone would use for redwood.
Jen19:40
Beginning for hyper.
Helen19:45
It could be. It could be. We're still sort of like going through different
scenarios. Brenton. It could be that we have just one.
Brenton19:55
So we would send as this.

s. So I&#39;ve Asked the teams to be able to go off and update, making sure=
 that the heat maps which are in confluence are up to date based on our Cap=
 Edge work plans. So big push there for everyone to ensure that those dates=
 are accurate and they align. I know that some have like more than just our=
 SDLC life cycles in there, but the important ones are going to be our UAT =
and our cutover timing. So those columns you guys are going to be used for =
feeders into the cutover plan as well as there&#39;s a new board that we&#3=
9;re creating that&#39;s going to be showing all of the applications basica=
lly being turned off and what our percent complete is going to be that we c=
ould utilize for our goal live date. So the heat maps here are going to be =
very influential to ensure that they&#39;re accurate for anything that is s=
till active that hasn&#39;t had a cutover before, let&#39;s say 529. So we&=
#39;re going into that, that our weekend of cutover, we are going to ask fo=
r cutover plans for each one of those. So maybe that&#39;s another incentiv=
e to be able to complete soon, sooner and then we wouldn&#39;t necessarily =
have to see that international team. I know that you guys have a very large=
 board, so it&#39;s not, we&#39;re not going to recreate your boards but ut=
ilize what you have there to be able to pull up and then we can do a summat=
ion. But again, for anything for cutting over the weekend of, we are going =
to be looking at those cutover plans as well. Right. And then Noah, who&#39=
;s leading cutover, is going to be working with William, the team and Frenc=
hie and Nicole as well to make sure that we have that in one centralized lo=
cation that we can have for a cutover weekend as well. And Jen, I know that=
 you&#39;re working on the Hypercare plans as well that would be leveraged =
off of that after. Yeah. So big focus on Thursday&#39;s meeting in regards =
to heat maps and just making sure that those are up to date. Does anybody h=
ave any questions? Okay, the last area is uat, which I know as of last nigh=
t or Friday night&#39;s updates, we were at 71. I want to say what we&#39;r=
e at 78 last night. So that&#39;s great. There are some areas that are a li=
ttle bit behind that. I know that Nicole&#39;s working hand in hand with pe=
ople to able to recover on those areas. But thank you very much for the ext=
ra hard work to be able to ensure that, you know, that things are being exe=
cuted well and that you&#39;re answering questions. I know it&#39;s a lot. =
Two more weeks left I have not heard or seen. I did hear but you know about=
 people adding additional UAT tests but, but I&#39;ve not seen it and I thi=
nk it was more related around HSC PMO tasks and just where we don&#39;t hav=
e a real clear visibility into that yet. But I don&#39;t, I haven&#39;t see=
n or heard anything about additional test scripts that needed to be added. =
It was more of like a concern on those areas, which is good news. I see tha=
t. Jen, Nicole, Noah, Chris, you guys are all working on the exit cross cri=
teria and we have briefed the SMO in regards to being able to do a two in t=
he box sign off. So that will indicate that their teams that number one, th=
ey&#39;re all inclusive of the test scripts that they wanted to be tested a=
nd number two that they have been completed and meet their standards based =
on the run rates. Like there was only 53 out of 10,000 scripts that had fai=
led which had then been like replanned and, and retest it again. So the tes=
ting is showing favorable results. So we&#39;ll be working on those package=
s to be able to get approvals on that. Does anybody have any questions? Yea=
h, we&#39;ll bring those to the end of day call this week one of them and s=
ee what the feedback is. Excellent, thanks. All right, that&#39;s all that =
we have on the agenda. Does anybody have anything else that we missed that =
you guys wanted to talk about?</div></div><div style=3D"margin-bottom:16px;=

 we should have a general mailbox as well so that we can send like repeat m=
