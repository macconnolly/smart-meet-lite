# Claude Tasks: Smart-Meet Lite Forensic Implementation Plan

**LAST UPDATED**: 2025-01-04 - FORENSIC AUDIT COMPLETE

This document contains the EXACT implementation requirements based on a comprehensive forensic audit of the codebase against the Master Implementation Plan (010_Master_Implementation_Plan.md). Every item includes exact line numbers, exact code to add/remove, and detailed context for implementation.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST

The system HAS all components but they're NOT properly connected. We need to:
1. Fix database indexes (wrong names)
2. Remove brittle regex patterns that break state tracking
3. Use existing batch operations for performance
4. Add self-healing validation
5. Make query engine async

**DO NOT** add new features. **DO NOT** refactor working code. Just fix the specific issues listed below.

---

## 🔴 PHASE 1: DATABASE INDEX FIXES (30 minutes)

### Task 1.1: Fix Duplicate Index
**FILE**: `src/storage.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Duplicate indexes slow writes

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Open `src/storage.py`
2. Go to line 154
3. **DELETE** lines 154-156:
```python
cursor.execute(
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_entities_normalized ON entities(normalized_name)"
)
```

**WHY**: Line 172 creates the same index with the correct name. Having duplicates wastes space and slows INSERT/UPDATE operations.

### Task 1.2: Fix Entity States Index Name
**FILE**: `src/storage.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Wrong name means queries don't use index

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Stay in `src/storage.py`
2. Go to line 158 (after deletion above, might be line 155)
3. **REPLACE**:
```python
# OLD:
cursor.execute(
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_entity_states_entity ON entity_states(entity_id)"
)

# NEW:
cursor.execute(
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_entity_states_entity_id ON entity_states(entity_id)"
)
```

**WHY**: The query optimizer looks for indexes by exact name. Wrong name = full table scan = slow queries.

### Task 1.3: Fix Transitions Index Name
**FILE**: `src/storage.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Wrong name causes slow timeline queries

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Stay in `src/storage.py`
2. Go to line 167 (after deletions above, might be line 164)
3. **REPLACE**:
```python
# OLD:
cursor.execute(
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transitions_entity ON state_transitions(entity_id)"
)

# NEW:
cursor.execute(
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_state_transitions_entity_id ON state_transitions(entity_id)"
)
```

**TEST**: After changes, restart the API. Check logs for "CREATE INDEX" statements. Should see 4 indexes created with correct names.

---

## 🔴 PHASE 2: REMOVE REGEX PATTERNS (1 hour)

### Task 2.1: Delete Pattern Definitions
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Regex patterns conflict with LLM results

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Open `src/processor_v2.py`
2. Go to line 31
3. **DELETE** everything from line 31 to line 93 (entire STATE_PATTERNS, ASSIGNMENT_PATTERNS, PROGRESS_PATTERNS)

**WHAT YOU'RE DELETING**:
```python
# State patterns for inference
STATE_PATTERNS = {
    "in_progress": [
        ...
    ],
    ...
}

# Assignment patterns for ownership detection
ASSIGNMENT_PATTERNS = [
    ...
]

# Progress indicators
PROGRESS_PATTERNS = [
    ...
]
```

### Task 2.2: Remove Duplicate LLM Client
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: HIGH - Wastes resources creating duplicate clients

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Stay in `src/processor_v2.py`
2. Go to line 101 (after deletions above, might be around line 40)
3. **DELETE** lines 101-121 (all the proxy setup and self.llm_client creation)

**KEEP** the constructor signature unchanged:
```python
def __init__(self, storage: Storage, entity_resolver: EntityResolver, embeddings: LocalEmbeddings, llm_processor: LLMProcessor):
    self.storage = storage
    self.entity_resolver = entity_resolver
    self.embeddings = embeddings
    self.llm_processor = llm_processor
    self.validation_metrics = {}
    # DELETE EVERYTHING BELOW THIS
```

### Task 2.3: Delete Pattern-Based Methods
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - These methods use deleted patterns

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find and **DELETE** entire method `_infer_states_from_patterns` (around lines 227-257)
2. Find and **DELETE** entire method `_extract_progress_indicators` (around lines 259-287)
3. Find and **DELETE** entire method `_extract_assignments` (around lines 290-312)
4. Find and **DELETE** entire method `_merge_state_information` (search for it after line 312)

### Task 2.4: Fix process_meeting_with_context
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - References deleted methods

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find `process_meeting_with_context` method
2. Go to approximately line 150
3. **REPLACE** lines 150-164 with:
```python
# 3. Extract current states from LLM output ONLY
extracted_states = self._extract_current_states(extraction, entity_map)
self.validation_metrics["states_captured"] = len(extracted_states)

# 4. Create transitions for ALL changes
transitions = await self._create_comprehensive_transitions(
    prior_states, extracted_states, meeting_id, extraction
)
self.validation_metrics["transitions_created"] = len(transitions)

# 5. Process relationships
relationships = self._process_relationships(
    extraction.relationships, entity_map, meeting_id
)

# 6. Update memory mentions
self._update_memory_mentions(extraction.memories, entity_map)

# 7. Validate completeness
self._validate_state_tracking(entity_map, extracted_states, transitions)
```

### Task 2.5: Remove Dead Code
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: MEDIUM - Cleans up confusion

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. In `_extract_current_states` method (around line 211)
2. **DELETE** lines 222-224 (the comment about extraction.states being empty)
3. The method should only process entities, not states

---

## 🔴 PHASE 3: USE BATCH OPERATIONS (30 minutes)

### Task 3.1: Batch Save Entities
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: HIGH - 10x performance improvement

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find `_process_entities` method
2. Go to approximately line 641
3. **REPLACE**:
```python
# OLD:
self.storage.save_entities(processed_entities)

# NEW:
self.storage.save_entities_batch(processed_entities)
```

### Task 3.2: Verify Batch Transitions
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: LOW - Already implemented

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find `_create_comprehensive_transitions` method
2. Go to line 436
3. **VERIFY** it shows:
```python
self.storage.save_transitions_batch(transitions)
```

If not, change it to use batch method.

---

## 🔴 PHASE 4: FIX QUERY ENGINE (1 hour)

### Task 4.1: Make Query Processing Async
**FILE**: `src/query_engine_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - API expects async

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Open `src/query_engine_v2.py`
2. Go to line 147
3. **REPLACE**:
```python
# OLD:
def process_query(self, query: str, user_context: Optional[Dict] = None) -> BIQueryResult:

# NEW:
async def process_query(self, query: str, user_context: Optional[Dict] = None) -> BIQueryResult:
```

### Task 4.2: Add Batch Fetching
**FILE**: `src/query_engine_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: HIGH - Major performance impact

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find `_build_query_context` method (around line 300)
2. Find the section that fetches entities
3. **REPLACE** the entity fetching logic with:
```python
# Collect all entity IDs from memories
entity_ids = set()
for result in relevant_memories:
    if result.memory.entity_mentions:
        entity_ids.update(result.memory.entity_mentions)

if entity_ids:
    # Batch fetch all entities and states
    entity_list = list(entity_ids)
    entities_dict = self.storage.get_entities_batch(entity_list)
    states_dict = self.storage.get_states_batch(entity_list)
    
    # Convert to lists
    entities = list(entities_dict.values())
    
    # Build state history
    state_history = {}
    for entity_id, state in states_dict.items():
        state_history[entity_id] = [state]  # Current state only
else:
    entities = []
    state_history = {}
```

### Task 4.3: Fix Async Handler Calls
**FILE**: `src/query_engine_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Must await async methods

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. In `process_query` method, find all handler calls (lines 162-176)
2. Add `await` to any that are async:
```python
# If handlers are async, change:
result = self._handle_timeline_query(context)
# To:
result = await self._handle_timeline_query(context)
```

---

## 🔴 PHASE 5: ADD ENTITY RESOLVER (30 minutes)

### Task 5.1: Use Resolver in Entity Processing
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: HIGH - Prevents duplicate entities

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find `_process_entities` method
2. Go to approximately line 606 (after entity name extraction)
3. **INSERT** after `normalized_name = self._normalize_name(name)`:
```python
# Try entity resolver first
resolved = self.entity_resolver.resolve_entities([name])
if name in resolved and resolved[name].entity:
    # Use the resolved entity
    existing = resolved[name].entity
    logger.info(f"Resolved '{name}' to existing entity '{existing.name}' (confidence: {resolved[name].confidence})")
else:
    # Fall back to direct lookup
    existing = self.storage.get_entity_by_name(normalized_name, entity_type)
```

---

## 🔴 PHASE 6: ADD SELF-HEALING VALIDATION (45 minutes)

### Task 6.1: Add Validation Method
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Prevents data loss

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find `_validate_state_tracking` method (around line 543)
2. **ADD** this new method immediately after it:
```python
def _validate_state_tracking_completeness(self, entity_map: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]], 
                                         final_states: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]], 
                                         transitions: List[StateTransition],
                                         meeting_id: str) -> None:
    """
    Self-heal missing transitions to ensure data integrity.
    This prevents state changes from being lost due to processing errors.
    """
    healing_transitions = []
    
    for entity_name, entity_info in entity_map.items():
        entity_id = entity_info["id"]
        
        # Check if entity has a state but no transition
        if entity_id in final_states:
            current_state = final_states[entity_id]
            has_transition = any(t.entity_id == entity_id for t in transitions)
            
            if not has_transition and current_state:
                # Create healing transition
                prior_state = self.storage.get_entity_current_state(entity_id)
                
                # Only create if state actually changed
                if prior_state != current_state:
                    healing_transition = StateTransition(
                        entity_id=entity_id,
                        from_state=prior_state,
                        to_state=current_state,
                        changed_fields=list(current_state.keys()),
                        reason="Auto-healed: State change detected without transition",
                        meeting_id=meeting_id
                    )
                    healing_transitions.append(healing_transition)
                    logger.warning(f"Self-healing: Created missing transition for {entity_name}")
    
    # Save healing transitions
    if healing_transitions:
        self.storage.save_transitions_batch(healing_transitions)
        self.validation_metrics["self_healed_transitions"] = len(healing_transitions)
        logger.info(f"Self-healing complete: Created {len(healing_transitions)} transitions")
```

### Task 6.2: Call Validation Method
**FILE**: `src/processor_v2.py`
**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Must be called

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. In `process_meeting_with_context` method
2. Find the call to `_validate_state_tracking` (around line 180)
3. **ADD** immediately after:
```python
# 11. Self-heal any missing transitions
self._validate_state_tracking_completeness(entity_map, extracted_states, transitions, meeting_id)
```

---

## 🟡 PHASE 7: UPDATE API HANDLERS (15 minutes)

### Task 7.1: Fix Query Endpoint
**FILE**: `src/api.py`
**URGENCY**: HIGH - Queries will fail without this

**EXACT STEPS**:

1. Find the `/api/query` endpoint handler
2. Make sure it awaits the async query engine:
```python
# Should be:
result = await query_engine.process_query(request.query)
# NOT:
result = query_engine.process_query(request.query)
```

---

## 🟢 TESTING & VERIFICATION

### Step 1: Start Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Qdrant
docker-compose up -d

# Terminal 2 - Start API
cd /path/to/smart-meet-lite
python -m src.api
```

### Step 2: Verify Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/detailed
```

**EXPECTED**: All components show "healthy"

### Step 3: Test Ingestion
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Sprint Planning",
    "transcript": "Alice: The authentication API is now in progress. Bob: Great! The database redesign is blocked on infrastructure approval."
  }'
```

**EXPECTED**: 
- Response includes entity_count > 0
- Logs show "Created state transition"

### Step 4: Test Search
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "authentication API", "limit": 5}'
```

**EXPECTED**: Returns memories with scores

### Step 5: Test Business Query
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the status of all projects?"}'
```

**EXPECTED**: Structured response with project statuses

---

## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: "RuntimeError: This event loop is already running"
**Fix**: Make sure all async methods are properly awaited, not called with asyncio.run()

### Issue: "No state transitions created"
**Fix**: Check logs for "Self-healing" messages - validation should auto-create missing transitions

### Issue: "Slow queries"
**Fix**: Restart API after index changes. Check SQLite with `.schema` to verify indexes exist

### Issue: "Duplicate entities"
**Fix**: Entity resolver changes should prevent this. Check logs for "Resolved X to existing entity"
