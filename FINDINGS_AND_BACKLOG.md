# Smart-Meet Lite: Current State Assessment & Backlog

## Executive Summary

After implementing entity resolution improvements and performing a clean reset, we've identified critical gaps between expected and actual functionality. While basic entity extraction and resolution work, the core business intelligence features have significant limitations.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Working Features

1. **Entity Extraction**
   - Entities are created with full names (no truncation)
   - 64+ entities successfully created across test scenarios
   - Entity types properly categorized (person, project, feature, deadline, etc.)

2. **Entity Resolution** 
   - Variations correctly matched (e.g., "mobile app project" → "mobile app redesign project")
   - Confidence scores provided (0.60-1.00 range)
   - Multiple resolution strategies (exact, fuzzy, vector, LLM)
   - No false positives ("vendor issues" ≠ "vendor quotes for infrastructure")

3. **Relationship Tracking**
   - Basic relationships created (owns, responsible_for, works_on)
   - Bidirectional relationship queries work
   - 11+ relationships successfully tracked

4. **Basic State Storage**
   - 102 entity states saved with confidence scores
   - States include status, attributes, and timestamps

### ❌ Critical Issues

1. **State Transition Tracking**
   - Only 16 state transitions recorded (should be 100+)
   - State changes between meetings not properly detected
   - Missing transition logic for status changes (planned → in_progress → completed)

2. **Timeline Queries**
   - Return 500 errors due to insufficient transition data
   - "How did X progress over time?" queries fail
   - No meaningful timeline data despite multiple meetings

3. **Complex Query Understanding**
   - "What blockers did we encounter?" returns generic system info
   - Low confidence (0.20) on many business queries
   - Fallback to generic responses instead of specific answers

4. **Data Quality Issues**
   - State changes mentioned in transcripts not captured
   - Missing critical business events (blockers, completions)
   - Inconsistent entity attribute updates

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. State Transition Detection Failure
**Issue**: The processor is creating entity states but not detecting changes between meetings.

**Evidence**:
```
- Meeting 1: "API optimization project is planned"
- Meeting 2: "API optimization project is now in progress"
- Result: New state created, but no transition recorded
```

**Root Cause**: `_process_state_changes()` in processor.py only creates transitions if previous state differs, but the comparison logic may be flawed.

### 2. Timeline Query Architecture
**Issue**: Timeline queries depend entirely on state_transitions table which has minimal data.

**Impact**: Any query about progress, changes, or history fails or returns empty results.

### 3. Query Intent Classification
**Issue**: Complex queries are being misclassified or falling back to generic search.

**Example**: "What blockers did we encounter?" should be a status query filtered by blocked states, not a generic search.

## Detailed Backlog

### 🔴 Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Production Blockers)

#### 1.1 Fix State Transition Detection
**File**: `src/processor.py`
**Function**: `_process_state_changes()`
**Issue**: Not detecting state changes between meetings
**Solution**:
- Add comprehensive logging to state comparison
- Fix state comparison logic (may be comparing JSON strings incorrectly)
- Ensure previous state is properly retrieved
- Add unit tests for state change scenarios

#### 1.2 Implement Robust State Change Detection
**New Feature**: Detect implicit state changes from transcript content
**Requirements**:
- Detect status keywords: "now in progress", "completed", "blocked"
- Track percentage/progress mentions: "50% complete"
- Identify state change indicators: "started", "finished", "waiting on"
- Create transitions even for implicit changes

#### 1.3 Fix Query Intent Classification
**File**: `src/query_engine.py`
**Issue**: Misclassifying complex queries
**Solution**:
- Improve intent detection for blocker/status queries
- Add query rewriting for common patterns
- Better keyword matching for business queries

### 🟡 Priority 2: Data Quality & Testing

#### 2.1 Create Comprehensive Test Data
**Requirement**: Realistic meeting transcripts that demonstrate all features
**Scenarios Needed**:
- Project lifecycle (kickoff → planning → execution → completion)
- Blocker identification and resolution

#### 2.2 Implement State Transition Tests
**New Tests**:
```python
test_state_transitions.py:

- test_completion_detection()
- test_metric_evolution()
```

#### 2.3 Add Data Validation
**Requirements**:
- Validate state transitions are created for every state change
- Ensure timeline data is complete
- Check entity attributes are properly updated
- Verify relationships are bidirectional

### 🟢 Priority 3: Enhanced Features

#### 3.1 Intelligent State Inference
**Feature**: Infer states from context when not explicitly stated
**Examples**:
- "Working on X" → status: in_progress
- "Waiting for approval" → status: blocked
- "Delivered yesterday" → status: completed

#### 3.2 Rich Timeline Queries
**Enhancements**:
- Show state duration (time in each state)
- Highlight blockers and resolutions
- Track velocity/progress rate
- Include related entity changes

#### 3.3 Better Query Responses
**Improvements**:
- Explain low confidence matches
- Suggest alternative queries
- Provide context for empty results
- Show available data when specific query fails

### 🔵 Priority 4: Testing & Monitoring

#### 4.1 End-to-End Test Suite
```python
test_e2e_business_scenarios.py:
- Complete project lifecycle
- Multi-meeting state evolution
- Complex dependency tracking
- Team reorganization
- Metric improvement tracking
```

#### 4.2 Monitoring & Diagnostics
**Add Metrics**:
- State transitions per meeting
- Query confidence distribution
- Entity resolution accuracy
- Timeline completeness score

#### 4.3 Data Quality Dashboard
**Features**:

## Code Changes Needed

### 1. processor.py - Fix State Change Detection
```python
def _process_state_changes(self, ...):
    # Add comprehensive logging
    logger.debug(f"Comparing states for {entity_id}")
    logger.debug(f"Previous: {previous_state}")
    logger.debug(f"Current: {current_state}")
    
    # Fix comparison logic
    # Current: if previous_state != state_dict:
    # Should be: if self._states_differ(previous_state, state_dict):
```

### 2. query_engine.py - Improve Intent Classification
```python
# Add blocker-specific intent detection
if any(word in query_lower for word in ['blocker', 'blocked', 'stuck', 'waiting']):
    intent_type = 'status'
    filters = {'status': ['blocked', 'waiting']}
```

### 3. New test_state_tracking.py
```python
def test_explicit_state_change():
    """Test that explicit state changes create transitions."""
    # Meeting 1: Project is planned
    # Meeting 2: Project is in progress
    # Verify: State transition created
```

This comprehensive backlog provides a clear path forward to fix the critical issues and enhance the system to meet its business intelligence promises.
